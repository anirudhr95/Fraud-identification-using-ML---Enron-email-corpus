Dear Ken, 
I hope things are going a little better.  I am convinced you are under a great deal of stress, but you are a great leader and will survive it.
We just received some disturbing news from Enron.  Photofete has served Enron for a year.  Our contract was for one year, we met with Enron two months ago to discuss whether or not Photofete was meeting Enron's objectives.  Marge Nadasky indicated that Enron was 100% happy.  We talked about a new contract but Marge assured us that the time to process the contract under the new procedures was not worth it nor needed.
Enron has given us notice that they no longer require the services of Photofete.  We feel a little misled.  We would have been happy to have renegotiated a new contract that met the financial and service needs of Enron, but were never given the chance.
I have worked with Enron for over 7 years and I am shocked at this.  I as well as anyone else who is running a business understand the crunch of our current economy.  Everyone has to reduce costs.
Marge indicated that she was happy with the service but had to make cuts which we understand.  What we do not understand is why they starting replacing our service 2 months ago before we had the opportunity to re-negotiate another contract.
We have already given one person notice and reduced our overhead, but we are truly disappointed. 
Please give me a call at 713-816-2412.

"Three proposals, following up our recent meeting.","Dr. Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman of the Board
Enron Corp.


	Dear Dr. Lay,

We met less than a week ago, on Wednesday 16 May 2001, during the OECD Forum
2001 in Paris.

I'm an independent consultant and innovator, with a special interest in
energy and new technologies. I have more than ten years experience in
research and innovation in economics, business and technology.

I attended the session on energy you chaired during that OECD Forum. After
the session, I had a discussion with you. Unfortunately, your time was too
short. You gave me your card and asked me to write you.

As I told you, I think I can add value to your staff, bring new lines of
businesses to Enron and with them, many new clients. And above all,
unprecedented profits.

I am writing you to propose my contribution in these purposes. I'm mainly
making three proposals to Enron.

1.- Working for Enron as an external consultant.

Here, I would rather like to work on assignments, medium or long term, with
a preference for the following jobs: risk assessment and/or management,
strategic analysis on geopolitical, macroeconomics and societal issues. I
think these are important tasks for a company like Enron. The current
problems with Enron's Dabhol power plant in the Maharashtra state in India
stresses the kind of importance I'm mentioning.

I can also conduct surveys and provide Enron with technical and fruitful
information and policy recommendations. I've done a job like that recently,
on the oil-pipeline project in Chad and Cameroon. As you may already know,
this is a $4 billion project recently launched, with the support of the
World Bank, and led by three major energy firms: Exxon and Chevron of the
USA, and Petronas of Malaysia. I wrote a detailed and long report, which
combined public and private sectors' concerns, and also communities'
interests. Having operations worldwide, Enron I think needs the type of
technical works I've done on that major energy project.

I have a good expertise in energy economics. I attend international
congresses on that subject, for instance in Boston in January 2000. Since
more than five years, as a journalist or as an independent consultant, I
have been covering the works and studies of, or participated to workshops
and seminar organized by, the IEA (International Energy Association). I know
Mr. Robert Priddle, IEA chair, who also attended that energy session during
the OECD Forum 2001. I know the work he and his team of experts have been
doing.


2.- Being fully employed by Enron.

In this respect, I would prefer to work as a researcher for either Enron
Project Development and Management or Capital and Risk Management
departments. In these fields, I've also innovated. I've created among
concepts, tools and processes. For instance, the ""Sensible Guide for
Action"". This is a tool theoretically powerful and practically very
efficacious. It's main goal is to help decision-makers, in both private and
public sectors. The Sensible Guide for Action assists them in their approach
to solve technical problems. The SGA is a five-leaf bough.

I've also created a method to assess a firm capacity to create wealth. This
method can be adapted to fit some particular projects. The method is very
useful in countries where there's no stocks market, and where capital
markets are not sufficiently large. That's the case of underdeveloped
countries in general, where yet the energy demand if forecast to grow the
most in the coming decades. Enron cannot overlook this, or miss the business
and profit opportunities in this growth.


3.- The Business of Businesses.

Dear Dr Lay, if you accept this third proposal, it will probably be the best
investment Enron has ever made. I'm an independent researcher and
entrepreneur, with a strong quantitative analysis competence, and a
multidisciplinary background, both by education and professionally. I'm a
graduate in mathematics and in mechanical engineering (University of Paris)
and also in business and economics (Institut d'Etudes Politiques of Paris).

In this third proposal I'm bringing to Enron two key inventions I've made,
two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies. I believe
they will interest Enron.

These products have a market potential worldwide, unlimited. They will
create an entirely new industry: the business of businesses.

I'm currently looking for investors with whom I can launch those products.
We will be the world leader here, and remain in that position for a long
time before copycats try to reach us. I've created the products, and nobody
knows about them or about their extraordinary markets.

I started to talk to you about these products when we met, but you were
hurrying, and the many solicitations and noises of the Forum made it
difficult to explain my point. I'm writing you as you asked me, because
firstly I believe these products will interest Enron. Secondly I know how
these products will boost three types of Enron services: Online Marketplace;
Broadband Services; and Energy & Commodities. Plus, these products, and the
business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for Enron.

Among the many reasons why I believe my products will interest Enron are
these:

(i) Their market is global.
(ii) They are directly related to consumption and savings.
(iii) They're excellent saving vehicles, for instance for pension or life
insurance.
(iv) They concern payment transactions and transmissions (And thanks to
information technology, costs here decrease while productivity will grow).
(v) They are both offline and online business (These products will be
excellent for Enron e-business).
(vi) I want to be and remain a global leader.
(vii) The products' growth potential is borderless
(viii) There's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have
strongly imposed ourselves as The Leader and the Reference, increasing
chances that customers remain faithful to us.
(ix) My products will allow Enron to beat its competitors.
(x) Enron will earn a lot of revenues, many new clients, and very big and
unprecedented profits.

I'm looking for investors willing to put around $7 million. Given that the
revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of $500 million to $1
billion, that initial $7 million is a wise and very profitable investment.

If you're interested, I'm ready to present the products and its business
scenario to you. The business model is very innovative, unprecedented.

These products' market is the whole world. But the first three markets I
would like to attack are the UK, Germany and moreover, Japan.

Today's news about Japan is rather bad. Economists and many observers see a
declining Japan. Me not. They may be right from a pure statistical and
macroeconomic viewpoint. But they fail to see deeper. They overlook the
other face of Japan. For my part, I see great business opportunities in
Japan, today and for the coming decade. Particularly for the financial
products I'm proposing.

These financial products I want Enron to launch with me in Japan, perfectly
fit Japanese consumption manners, their problematic pension system, and life
insurance structure there.

Public pension systems are under pressure every where, particularly in
Japan. In Germany they are trying to reform it. But there's no consensus in
the governments (federal and states') or in the Parliaments (federal and
states'). Last week, Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der won some parliamentary
approval. But the package he proposed is far from solving the issue.

In the meantime, problems may accumulate, the situation could worsen. What
seems sure is that in a foreseeable future, governments, not only in Germany
but in all developed and ageing countries, will no longer be able to pay
pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise.

An additional bad news, even company pensions will suffer. In today's
""Financial Times"" (Tuesday 22 May 2001, page 17), Peter Thompson, incoming
chairman of the British National Association of Pension Funds ""warned UK
workers that they would no longer rely on comfortable company"". He adds that
""many wold have to work until they were 75 -- 10 years longer than the
current retirement age - if they wanted to enjoy a financially comfortable
old age"".

Therefore, workers and citizens should start, right no! to save for
themselves. My products are here the best saving vehicle I know.

And to what I know of Enron, it seems to me that Enron's shareholders also
will appreciate the kind of new business and investment opportunity I'm
bringing to their company. They will allow Enron to create a new and
unprecedented business model that all its competitors will envy. In a way,
Enron will change for its advantage, the way to do business in general, and
energy business in particular, thanks to the ""business of businesses""
concept I've elaborated.


Dear Dr. Lay, as I read in Enron's web site, the list of awards you have
received: impressive. Congratulations! Two qualities common to all of them
are leadership and creativity. I wish these will help you to catch the
wonderful opportunity I'm bringing to you, in order to allow Enron to
accomplish a phenomenal progress.

Leadership and moreover creativity are also two qualities I've been trying
to put into practice. This effort creates a sort of affinity between us.
Thus, I think we can easily understand one another, speaking in some way,
the same language. Hence an additional reason that brings me to write you
and to make my proposal directly to you.

Given what I've learned of Enron's vision and values, I would like to stress
four of the twelve headings that are listed in Enron ""vision and values""
page: innovation, diversity, change and excellence. Four headings that are
at work in each of the three proposals I've just made to you. When I knew
you were coming to that Forum, I prepared some materials for you and was
ready to present my proposals to you in details and to answer all your
questions. I'm still ready to do it. I'm even ready to come to Houston for
that purpose.


In one recent Enron's ad, I read : ""Enron: Endless possibilities"". Let's
make it true. Let's do it together. Let's reap the enormous benefits of ""The
Business of Businesses""!

Thank you.

Best regards.

"My congratulations on your address to us this morning","After listening to your speech this morning, I am now, more than ever, proud to be an Enron Employee under your leadership.  Your commitment and fortitude under trying circumstances is always steady and going forward. During all the past years of success and truly phenomenal growth I along with my co-workers have been richly rewarded.   Not only was I rewarded economically but also my friends and superiors contributed huge amounts of time and money toward others less fortunate and able to help themselves.  

This is a direct reflection of your leadership and your giving back to the community.  This leadership by example is what will sustain us in the coming months as we build our stock back up.  I have no doubt build it up we will.  There is nothing more invigorating than a challenge to show your true courage and ambition. Shifting blame and finding scapegoats has never been your style and I am very glad to see we are not starting down that road.  I feel the up coming Chairman's Award will be a great boost to morale. 

People measure success very differently. I feel just as successful today as a year ago because I answer to a higher authority than our stock price. Enron's helping of our neighbors during the floods and the New Yorkers during their tragedies makes me very proud to work at this company.  Time is a better indicator of how well we persevered during these rather tumultuous times.  Here's to a better view in two thousand two.

"Yesterday's Call: Feedback","Ken,

Thanks for having the call yesterday.  I am a believer in Enron and we are
buying your debt.

Here's short feedback on the call.  I give the call a B-/C+ grade.  If you
want a good example of a company call listen to the tougher calls So Cal Ed
had for investors.  They talked with investors twice weekly for months.
There is an honestness and openness about the calls that worked to keep
investors informed.

The angry exchange with the short seller was a blunder.  No matter what the
question, no matter how stupid or obnoxious, the Enron answer should always
be empathetic and pointedly factual.  Yes, you will have to open the kimono
more than Enron ever has to restore confidence.

ENE has become more a financial institution, and less an energy company
with hard assets.  You are in a confidence game pure and simple.  Any
attempt at keeping things close to the vest will backfire and exacerbate
the current crisis.  If you want to see disclosure in financials, look at
Citi's...

ENE is having an encounter session with the entire investment community.
This is not a time to be aggressive and smart.  It is a time to be open,
honest and self-effacing.

Third party confirmation will go a long way in restoring confidence which
means 1) Moody's maintains their rating or limits the change to a one-notch
downgrade (bond rating) with stable outlook restored (the Moody's analyst
is pissed you surprised with the write-off), 2) the SEC gives ENE a fairly
clean report (no self-dealing found) on their transactions with private
equity partnerships, 3) no more large surprise write-offs, 4) outside
auditors continue with unqualified audit reports, 5) operating earnings
targets are met for this year and next, and 6)fuller disclosure is made in
quarterly releases.

Of course, if any fraud or malfeasance is found, you guys and ENE are
history.

I have my ass on the line because I believe in ENE.  We have made
investments.  ENE is in the shitter because of ENE's past communication and
behavior mistakes.  Be humble, be smart, and change.

Good Luck!

Jeff

P.S.  You state there is a Chinese wall between LJM and ENE.  Why in the
world then would you have the same guy, Fastow, play key controlling roles
in both organizations?  If you want to pay him, pay him.  Keep it simple.

I am glad Skilling is gone.  I wouldn't touch your company's debt while he
was there.  I hated him and his attitude?.and my past exposure to him was
extremely limited.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Endurance, Encouragement, Hope and Bring Home Good Fruit","Endurance, Encouragement, Hope and Bring Home Good
Fruit

I heard these words today in our Homily at church.
They seemed to jump out at me with the current
situation we have all been faced with at Enron.

You have endured through a tremendous storm.  Although
your colleagues have disappeared leaving you to hold
the bag, although you are at the center of intense
criticism and accusations from investors, shareholders
and employees and although the media has been brutal,
you have endured.  Your endurance, I believe, gives us
the endurance, the encouragement and the hope that
Enron will stabilize and be as strong as it ever was
and with a much stronger foundation.  Turmoil serves
only to strengthen and bring a community together.  It
was true on September 11th and it can be true at
Enron.  We have been shaken, but we cannot give up.
With hope anything is possible.

Enron has been my home for 20 years.  I was there when
we became Enron.  The last week was extremely
difficult for all, ""the straw that broke the camels
back"" for me was when I came in to workout on Friday
morning at 5:30 a.m. and the Body Shop was closed.  A
note on the front door, ""the Body Shop would be
shutting down at 7:30 p.m. Thursday evening"".  I had
been so strong up to this point.  After I found a
place to shower, I cried for two hours.  A culmination
of events finally broke me.  I had been so optimistic.
 I am blessed ""for the moment"", I still have a job.  I
believe I would be blessed even if I didn't have a
job.

I have not given up.  As long as we have you and ""you
can endure"", I know we will all make it through this
storm.

May God Bless You

Nelda Shealy

"RE: FERC Meeting Summary","If Chairman Wood does not put California in with the rest of the West, that will help ease some, certainly not all, the fears of many western House members and Senators.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Novosel, Sarah  
Sent:	Wednesday, September 26, 2001 4:10 PM
To:	Lay, Kenneth; Whalley, Greg; Frevert, Mark; Kean, Steven J.; Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Robertson, Linda; Nicolay, Christi L.; Fulton, Donna; Shelk, John; Shortridge, Pat; Long, Chris; Presto, Kevin M.; Davis, Mark Dana; Mayes, Tomasine; Will, Lloyd; Broderick, Paul J.; Lindberg, Susan
Subject:	FERC Meeting Summary

The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to ""marry up,"" meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an ""RTO week"" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some ""sticks"" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these ""sticks"" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how ""FERC can get there.""  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NOPR"") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

Dear Mr. Lay, 
My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards. However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee. 
This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.   
If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions. 
I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue! 
The Trigger and Retaliation.   
Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge. 
I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following:  
-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work 
-        that I was making jobapplications by company email 
Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment. 
As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has: 
-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval. 
- Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, I am still have not been informed of my PRC results. 
-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further. 
Discrimination.  
It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him. 
Hostile Working Environment. 
The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by ""threats"" rather than constructive comments.   
Wrongful Termination. 
Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time.  
I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case. 
Yours sincerely, 
Mingcheng Lian

"To All Warren Electric Group friends...From the Thompson-Draper-Schmidt-McAlvany Family:","
Dear Warren Electric Group friends,


On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 AM (EST), the United States of America was
forever changed!

The despicable acts of war by unknown cowardly terrorists have touched
each one of us very, very deeply -- beyond mere words.

For those of us that have family members or themselves that lived
through and fought for our freedom in World War II, Korea, Vietnam,
and/or Desert Storm, I am sure they thought that it was not possible for
these ghastly deliberate acts of terrorism to really happen on American
soil! BUT, it really did happen, and we must not forget that it did! God
rest all those souls...it really happened; and the truth is it could
happen again anywhere, anytime.

Americans must not panic because that would be allowing ""Evil"" to win!
We are mourning the hundreds of lives lost in this devastation. We are
Angry. We are Resolute and we want JUSTICE! Our home has been attacked!

Our American leaders show great strength under pressure proving that the
world's leader - the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is still the world's
leader in democracy and is still on duty! This horrific act of
aggression did not and will not stop democracy!

God Bless our leaders - give them the strength of mind, wisdom, and
character to get through this time of crisis and beyond.

We the people of America whether we are from small towns, metropolitan
cities, the country, or living abroad are bonded together - UNIFIED -
standing shoulder-to-shoulder together as ONE! We will survive, we will
PREVAIL!

My mother, Claude, has told me many times about the day she and Dad
found the first Warren - Houston building. They were looking through the
window of a building just a few blocks from where our headquarters is
today, a car came to a screeching halt, a man jumped out of the car and
screamed, ""they've just bombed Pearl Harbor""! The day was December 7,
1941 - 59 years and 9 months ago...that day has always been referred to
as ""the DAY that lives in Infamy"".... well, September 11, 2001 is going
to be a day remembered in an even more dramatic way!

As we gather our thoughts, prayers and plans for our future we the
owners of the company want all of you to know how much we love each and
everyone of you and your families. No matter what our futures holds the
people we have worked with side-by-side and have gotten to know are very
special to us. God bless each one of you.

Now as our President, George W. Bush, turns his attention outward to the
resolution of this crime against the civilized world we MUST do our
part! We must not allow chaos or panic to take hold!

It is time to redouble our commitment to the United States of America
and for all She stands. As we return to our jobs we will work harder; we
will donate blood to help New York and Washington D.C.; we will
sacrifice without complaint; we will prove to those that would crush and
bury the USA that this CANNOT be done. Not by King George, nor by
slavery, the Kaiser, Hitler, nor Krushaev and most assuredly not by this
latest cowardly gang of thugs.

The United States of America IS strong and we will make Her even
stronger with every passing day. Be proud to be an American. Be proud to
be free.

GOD BLESS AMERICA - OUR HOME SWEET HOME !!!!!!!!!!!!


From the Thompson-Draper-Schmidt-McAlvany Family Owners of Warren
Electric Group

"Attacking The Victim Aids The Criminals","

  P.O. Box 320932 Cocoa Beach, Florida USA 32932-0932  3 January 2002    Subj:   Attacking The Victim Aids The Criminals      Bob Butterworth Florida Attorney General butterworth@oag.state.fl.us  AG@oag.state.fl.us      Dear Attorney General,              Re:   19 December 2001 ltr. subj:   ""Complaint Against Enron,"" from Office Of Attorney General, Jeffrey M. Dikman, Assistant Attorney General, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.   A copy is provided for your convenience (as item 6) via the site index page at:   http://members.fortunecity.com/corruptioningovernment/               The referenced letter stated, ""The Florida State Board of Administration, which administers Florida's public pension plans, will be seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff in the pending Texas class action against Enron and others.""              Such action appears to be joining to administer a death blow to Enron stockholders as a service to International Organized Crime whose agents, as Wall Street Market Operators, have severely and extensively watered Enron and other securities through the sale of bogus, counterfeit receipts.   Whereas, the real responsible entities (in the case of Enron) are the New York Stock Exchange officers and specialists serving those profiting via the secret omnibus accounts through which funds from the sale of bogus, counterfeit receipts are distributed to secret unidentified parties.   The existence of those secret omnibus accounts has been documented in US Congressional Reports.              Certain officers of Enron Corporation obviously have been privy to certain aspects of the aforecited illicit activities and deliberately helped to set up Enron Corporation for bankruptcy.   In doing so, they were privy to planned negative manipulation of Enron securities prices and rewarded by early and profitable sales of securities held by them.              Again, may I caution against actions detrimental to Enron stockholders while transferring blame and liability to the Corporation and naive officers (fallguys) thereof while ignoring the real criminal parties whose actions are ultimately robbing all citizens.

"Annual Meeting 2002 Programme - KnowledgeConcierge Service - NRO","To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

Now that you have received the Annual Meeting 2002 Programme Preview, we
would like to assist you further in preparing for various workshops and
interactive sessions.

The World Economic Forum and PricewaterhouseCoopers have developed an
innovative service on our website, the KnowledgeConcierge. The
KnowledgeConcierge allows you to learn more about a workshop or interactive
session in the Annual Meeting 2002 by providing a ""state of the debate""
essay which frames the particular topic addressed.

As a further enrichment, it provides pre-selected links to key online
resources on the topic area. Finally, it offers a Personal Query service:
all participants in workshops and interactive sessions have the opportunity
to enquire further about specific issues related to programme topics. The
responses developed by a KnowledgeConcierge research team will be returned
to enquirers within a maximum of 24 hours.

The KnowledgeConcierge is now available by first clicking on the Annual
Meeting 2002 link in the Members' Area of the World Economic Forum's
website (http://www.weforum.org/private). Once in the Annual Meeting 2002
area, click on the programme link. From a workshop/session page, you can
access the KnowledgeConcierge by clicking on the ""read more"" link on the
right-hand side of the screen.

As a reminder, your personal username and password to access the Members'
Area are as follows:

Username: ldaly
Password: tfrcxsuw

Again, we encourage you to explore online the Annual Meeting 2002 programme
to prepare for your participation in New York.


Yours sincerely,

Lee Howell
Director, Annual Meeting Programme

But Jesus is not evil, and you are not a Christian. When Jesus said ""There will be many who call me Lord! Lord!, but they will be cast out of heaven, for they never knew me""... he was talking about YOU.

"Relief for Enron ""Alumni""","Although you have many things on your mind, former
employees that have been left out in the cold deserve
better than they are getting. The following was sent
to questions@enron.com:

I understood that the petition for the $4500 ($4650)
for immediate relief was only one of at least two or
more.

Based on a group meeting on 12/03, prior to being
asked to vacate the building, it was my understanding
that there was also a petition, presented by Enron on
behalf of its severed employees, before the bankruptcy
court for the ""standard"" severance package that was
posted on the enron.com website.

Due to the speed at which Enron filed for bankruptcy,
respect for loyal employees that were let go, the
general state of the economy, and time of year, it
would be appreciated if someone within the company
could work with the court to assist employees in
providing relief in the form of the severance package
rather than each of us having to petition the court.

Whoever is reviewing these questions is still at Enron
and understands that $4500 is not going to keep the
wolf from the door long enough for most of us.

Please advise.


=====
Sincerely,

June Walker

"How can I help?","Dear Ken . . .

I'm truly heartbroken at the ""perfect storm"" which seems to have
engulfed Enron.  I'm sure that last few months have been unbelievably
stressful for you personally. YI wanted you to know that you
can call on me, anytime, anywhere and under any circumstances if I can
be of any help whatsoever--no compensation expected.  It is my hope that
our
friendship willsurvive the current calamity.  I admire your
accomplishments enormously, Ken, and I am
eager to repay some of the generosity you have shown to me and Strategos

in recent years.  If there's anything you'd like to talk about, at any
point, please do get in touch.  I shall be praying for you and all the
Enron team in these extraordinarily trying times.  Please stay in touch.

Ken:

The AIG team, including senior management, are very enthusiastic about the transaction but are somewhat tentative with respect to going back to Greenberg because he had most recently halted the process subject to a positive signal.  I think a call from you to Greenberg would accelerate the process - if you would not mind.

Subject:	To Chuy's defenders

Dear OfficeName1234,

It is definitely working.  The world is being made aware of Chuy's  actions
and the Dems are lining up to eat that crap Chuy's calls tex-mex.

Talk about poetic justice.  May you all gag on a giant hairball.

Just who is it that ever complained about the Clinton or Gore kids? They got
a pass on everything, even when little Al was thrown out of school for his
drug abuse. That Chuy's grease  has clogged your mind,

JR

PS  Why don't you sign your name to your courageous pronouncements?

Subject: HoustonChronicle.com

Isn't it funny that the same people who would have been screaming the
loudest
about the ""immorality"" of Bill and Hilary Clinton had their daughter,
Chelsea, been cited for underage drinking  are the same people who now find
the treatment of the Bush family so ""outrageous?""  I can't stand Chuy''s
because their food is too heavy but I plan to eat there every week just to
offset the amazing level of hypocrisy I have seen in the several e-mails I
have received related to this subject.

"faith","Mr. Lay,
Enron has been very good to our contract company.  We have very little expectation of being paid but we love this company as much as you do.  We work in your corporate records with a great group of people and I feel we are needed there at this time.  We have so much faith in you and we know you will pull Enron through this tumultuous time.  This is meant to be a note of encouragement for a man we all admire very much.  You've done it before.  You can do it again.

Re: 	RFF In The News

As one means of keeping the Board more informed about the increased
attention being paid to RFF in the press, we are attaching an excerpt
from RFF In The News.  It is a rolling update of when, where, and in
what context RFF scholars and RFF publications are cited by the media.
We have created this evolving tracking mechanism and are still tweaking
it to comprehensively capture citations of RFF in the print and
electronic press, at a reasonable cost, and in a manner that is useful
both internally and in promoting RFF via the Web.

We would welcome your reactions.

I can only imagine the pain you must be enduring during these trying times
at Enron.  I hope that you decide to fight to keep Enron --- ""Enron"" so that
you can return Enron to the company it once was ... with leaders that
appreciate and live up to important values.  I still believe that you can
restore your reputation to that which represents your true self.

ROUNDTABLE WITH HENRY KISSINGER, PARIS, MAY 28, 2001. At a roundtable meeting hosted by NAI, HENRY KISSINGER discussed the future of ballistic missile defense, the ABM Treaty, and NATO enlargement. He encouraged a transatlantic approach toward Russia. Other meeting participants included MARC PERRIN DE BRICHAMBAUT of the French Ministry of Defense; ROBERT COOPER of the UK's Cabinet office; AEI's RICHARD PERLE; and MICHEL FOUCHER of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

LUNCH DISCUSSION WITH EMYR JONES PARRY, AEI, MAY 17, 2001. According to Parry, the political director of the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Britain wants to see Europe succeed in a way that doesn't diminish Europe's transatlantic link.  Contrary to press reports, he explained that not even the French advocate something separate from NATO.  Thus, talk of a slow cooling in the Atlantic alliance may be greatly exaggerated, according to Parry, who also fielded questions about North Korea, saying that U.S. and E.U. positions are really ""not so different.""

LUNCH WITH RUSSIAN BUSINESS LEADERS, AEI, MAY 2, 2001. RICHARD PERLE hosted Club 2015, a group of Russian business leaders and politicians, who together discussed the danger of a Russian military that is holding onto the past, the problems of widespread corruption, the consequences for internal policy formation, and the direction of U.S.-Russia relations.  Agreement centered around the fact that there are few immediate threats to Russia that necessitate a military response.  The Russians see difficulty in coming to agreement on issues of NATO expansion and missile defense and insist on a less unilateral, more dialogue-oriented U.S. approach.  What the Russians need to do in relations with the U.S., Perle suggested, is drop their old agenda.

BLAIR SHOULD KEEP A CLOSER EYE ON AMERICA by Irwin Stelzer, The Sunday Times, May 6, 2001.  Stelzer argues that ""Events have soured the Anglo-American relationship to the point where it is on the verge of losing its 'special' character.""  After Blair's expected victory this month, it will inevitably be time for him make firm policy decisions that will undoubtedly impact the UK's relationship with the US.  Between cuts in EU defense spending, plans for the ERRF, and U.S. missile defense talks, the special relationship faces many challenges.

OUT TO TORPEDO MISSILE DEFENSE by Robert Kagan, Washington Post, May 9, 2001.  Kagan points out the bitter partisanship of the Democrats' flip-flop on missile defense.  Last year, Democrats were lining up to support Clinton's efforts to deploy NMD; this year, they make every effort to oppose Bush in his talks on the issue, culminating in former U.N. ambassador Richard Holbrooke's call for Europe to be more vocal in opposing the President's plans.

US TO UK: DON'T LET BRUSSELS RUIN IT by Toby Harnden, The Spectator, May 12, 2001.  Reporting on NAI's recent panel discussion on European defense, Harnden discusses the transatlantic controversy surrounding ESDP.  The NAI discussion proved that while many Europeans are convinced of ESDP's necessity, American officials remain extremely skeptical of their intentions.  Participating on the panel were CHARLES GRANT of the Centre for European Reform (London), CHRISTOPH BERTRAM of the Institut fuer Wissenschaft und Politik (Berlin), GILLES ANDREANI of the French Foreign Ministry, AEI's RICHARD PERLE, and former CIA director R. JAMES WOOLSEY.  UPI's MARTIN WALKER served as the panel chairman.

EUROPE, MEET MR. RUMSFELD by Jeffrey Gedmin, Wall Street Journal Europe, May 23, 2001.  The Bush administration has been off to a rocky start with its European allies. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ""appears to hold special honors,"" writes Gedmin, ""when it comes to fueling European anxieties."" Gedmin reviews U.S.-European disagreements on missile defense and ESDP, arguing that Rumsfeld, rather than being an ideologue as detractors contend, is taking a strictly pragmatic view of most transatlantic issues.

WASHINGTON FINDS A SOFT SPOT FOR ITS OLD ENEMY by Gerard Baker, Financial Times, May 31, 2001.  Baker argues that the US and Russia can redefine their relationship in terms of two democracies cooperating toward common goals without the use of the ABM treaty.  According to Baker, perhaps ""the refusal of some Europeans to consider the possibility of a fundamentally changed relationship with Russia*owes more to an enduring eagerness to frustrate US ambitions than to work for lasting transatlantic cooperation.""

DRIVING A TRANS-ATLANTIC WEDGE by Jeffrey Gedmin, Wall Street Journal Europe, June 5, 2001.  As U.S. President George Bush prepares to embark on his first trip to Europe, Gedmin reviews the apparent obsession of some EU elites with the issue of the death penalty in the United States. Gedmin argues that opinion about capital punishment is more complex on both sides of the Atlantic than some would like to admit. According to Gedmin, some in Europe are using the death penalty to express Euronationalist, anti-American sentiment.

"Thank You, Also!!","Ken

I know it has been several years since we spoke, but I wanted to thank you for your kind note, and to personally thank you for the opportunities that Enron has provided to me over the years.

I am one of those few who was already with HNG in 1984, and still vividly remember the day that you arrived.  The building was immediately permeated by a sense of urgency and excitement.  That pace was relentless - and addictive.  I also remember in detail the Internorth merger in 1985, and feel proud to have played a part, however small it was, in that transaction.

The late 1980's and the early 1990's will probably always be my favorite years of my working life.  There were so many initiatives in Enron in their infancy.  Although it was an initiative that faced insurmountable economics and ultimately failed, I am grateful that Enron gave me the opportunity to participate in the natural gas vehicle adventure.  I never really understood until that adventure the full meaning of the old axiom that the lessons learnt best are those learnt from adversity and from making mistakes!!

I will try to remember Enron with those years through the mid-1990's in mind.  I have to say that I consider those to be the best years, because I have witnessed a degradation of the corporate culture in the past few years.  That is clearly a subjective assessment, and should be treated as such.  I am under no illusions:  Enron is a business entity operating in markets and environments that are relentlessly competitive, with a primary responsibility to its shareholders.  But I and many of my colleagues who also have long tenure at Enron and its predecessors share this assessment.  I am always amused by the irony of the stated value ""Ruthlessness, callousness and arrogance do not belong here"", since these appear to be the key defining personal characteristics of most of the senior management of ENA in recent years.

And unfortunately, the very sale of HPL by Enron has been for some an example of the degradation of corporate culture.  For myself, I know what to expect - I know that with corporate divestitures comes the need to control information as the transaction evolves.  But for the ""rank and file"" - those who live from paycheck to paycheck - it has not been a pleasant experience.  They maintained their professionalism (indeed many of them probably worked harder than anybody else to make the transaction happen).  In return, there has been an appalling lack of timely information and misinformation from Enron management and HR department with respect to their benefits and career choices.  HR in particular has been totally non-responsive to individual inquiries in the past few months - not returning phone calls and emails from HPL employees with questions, even after the transaction was announced.  Even as recently as the past couple of days, only upon receipt of their termination packages did several dozen employees discover that they had been misinformed by HR with respect to some aspects of their remaining Enron benefits.

For myself, my years at Enron will remain a high point of my career.  It is a badge of honor in the energy industry to have been a dealmaker at Enron, particularly for as many years as I was there.  I know Enron will continue to set the standards by most measures in this industry, and, for what its worth, I humbly wish you continued success.

Thanks

Subject:	Thank You

I want to take this opportunity before the transfer of Houston Pipeline Company assets and employees to American Electric Power to thank each of you for your teamwork and success in our years together.

Some of you were here when I joined your company in 1984, but many of you arrived during the Enron era and might not know the full story of my arrival.  I was president of Transco Energy at the time and was probably in line to be the chairman.  I did not expect to ever join another energy company.  Yet the directors of Houston Natural Gas felt like a new management team was needed for their company to prosper in a rapidly changing industry environment.  The quality of people I saw at HNG convinced me that the company would be a good platform from which to make major changes.  And the results over the last 17 years could not have been better.

Houston Pipeline Company has been a major contributor to developing Enron into what it is today.  Your professionalism, ideas, dedication and commitment toward this company have been instrumental in making our success possible.  For this, you will not only be a critical part of Enron's history, but you will also always deserve Enron's gratitude.

I wish you nothing but the very best in your next endeavors, even as I am sure you will not need my good luck wishes.  As always, your professionalism and dedication will be your best allies when facing new challenges and opportunities.

Sincerely,

"Update for Defense of Houston","October 11, 2001

To: Defense of Houston Advisory Board

From: S. Ward. Casscells, M.D.

Dear Members of the Advisory Board:

I apologize for not being better touch but we all have day jobs.  I am
writing to give you a brief update and some small requests.

As you know, there has been a third case of anthrax in Florida and the
FBI has issued a warning today that suggests they have picked up some
credible information about possible threats.

You also may have read that the Mayor Brown and County Judge Eckels have
gotten together and updated the Disaster Encounter Terrorism Plans.  The
Houston's Fire Department Medical Director, Dr. David Persse, is
conducting drills.  The Mayor has asked Baylor Chancellor Ralph Feigin,
M.D. to head a Medical Advisory Task Force to the Medical Strike Team.
Several members of our Board are on that including, Drs. Feigin, Duke,
Willerson, Mattox and myself.

That group has also met with Ambassador Edward P. Djerejian, Director of
the James A. Baker, III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University,
and by phone with Mr. Baker and Representative John Neuhaus is attending
a variety of meetings on behalf of the Houston Task Force on
Counter-Terrorism.  In short, these groups overlap considerably and
there has been quite a lot of communication.

You also read that Governor Rick Perry has appointed the Land
Commissioner, David Dewhurst to be the Counter-Terrorism ""Tzar"" for the
State of Texas.

Defense of Houston continues to post news several times a day and the
growth in leadership has been gratifying, as has the volunteers who have
come to help (we need more!).

On your behalf, several weeks ago I invited the following people to
visit Houston to advise and encourage us and perhaps guide us in how we
might obtain (for the first time) Houston's fair share of federal
counter-terrorism funding:  Director of Homeland Security, Gov. Thomas
Ridge, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, Senator
Kay Bailey Hutchison, Congressman Ken Bentsen, Congressman Tom Delay,
Homeland Security Director for the Department of Defense General Tom
White, Commandant of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material
Command, General John Parker, M.D., David Dewhurst and of course, Mayor
Lee Brown.

I am happy to tell you that all have agreed to visit and we may even
have a date of the afternoon of Friday, October 19.

The plan would be to tour the Medical Center and review of the Medical
Center's plans, which Dr. Feign and I would lead, together with Drs.
Willerson, Mendelsohn, Wainerdi, Persse, Mattox, and Mr. Dan Wilford.
We would hope you would be able to attend a reception and press
conference.

As you know, our goal is to make Houston as safe as possible starting
with the Texas Medical Center.  Our specific tasks are: 1) to educate
medical personnel, government officials , and the public, 2) to promote
communication and coordination among all those involved, 3) to improve
prevention, detection and response.

The work before us essentially can be divided into things which can be
done immediately and those which await funding, with examples including
equipment and research.

I will be posting a draft on the bulletin board tomorrow for comments.
Please recall that the user id is ""Houston"" and the password is
""Defense.""  You are welcome to create a private password if you like.

We are acquiring another server soon that we will use to off write
public bulletin board in addition to the password protected bulletin
board for the Advisory Board.

The Advisory Board has already done a great deal in terms of generating
new ideas and lending the names of its members.  I have no doubt that
this impressive and representative group of community leaders explain
the awareness of these very busy cabinet secretaries to visit Houston so
quickly.  I believe they will tell us our city is in better shape than
almost any other and that they will agree to help us to make things
better still.  All Houstonians are in your debt.

Sincerely,

S. Ward Casscells, M.D.

Slow Progress in Asset Sales - we have been discussing sales for the past 18 months with limited closings

Material Working Capital/Margin Expansion - has resulting in negative cash flow from operations

"Quicksilver Resources","Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

Jim Hughes

"DRAFT -- Enron Holiday Party Canceled","DRAFT (Can we allow employees the afternoon of December 14 off?)

This is a trying time for all of us.  I carefully considered whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year and, to be honest, employee feedback was mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  After all, the challenges we face as a company seem small in relation to the significance of this holiday season, especially in light of the events of September 11.

However, I have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it would be imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.

While Enron cannot provide parties this year, we will give employees worldwide the afternoon off on Friday, December 14, so that they can spend time with their families and friends.

I wish you the best this holiday season,
Ken Lay

			   Why I Want To Go To Congress     Carroll G. Robinson, Candidate - 25th  District    The federal government must  prioritize our needs in these tight economic and uncertain times.  Congress and the President must  focus on strengthening our economy for both the short and long term.  The working men and women of  America as well as those now unemployed and underemployed must be  provided for along with incentives to help create jobs.  Our nation must maintain a strong  military and enhance homeland security, our public health system and  emergency room and trauma care system.  We must work together to improve  access to healthcare for all Americans. We must immunize all of our  children; strengthen and protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid;  enact into law a real Patients' Bill of Rights, Prescription Drug  Benefit; and incentives to bring into and retain more nurses in the  medical profession.  We must maintain our commitment to  access to a quality education for all Americans as a cornerstone to our  nation's strength, economic prosperity and overall quality of life.  We must have universal access to  Pre-K for all 3 and 4 year olds and every child in a public or charter  school should be provided a lap top or hand held computer from the first  day they start school. We need more teachers, smaller classes, more  construction funding and enhanced compensation for educational  professionals.  Housing, Transportation,  Environmental Protection and the Infrastructure necessary to sustain our  community must also be among our priorities.  I want to work with other elected  officials to mitigate flooding and provide more parks, libraries and  other quality of life amenities to ensure that our community remains  safe, clean, prosperous and livable.

"Daschle, Bingaman Introduce Energy Bill","
Dear Board and Associates:
 
Senators Daschle, Bingaman and other Democratic Senators today introduced new comprehensive energy legislation.   Attached, please find a copy of the Alliances quick analysis (http://www.ase.org/media/newsrel/dashbinganalysis.htm or see below for complete statement) and reaction (http://www.ase.org/media/newsrel/dashbingbill01.htm or see below for complete statement).  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is doing an analysis of the bill which they indicate will be available ""sometime tomorrow"" on their homepage, http://energy.senate.gov ; attached is a Reuters article on today's introduction:
http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011205/pl/energy_congress_dc_7.html
 
 
You'll note that the bill does not include specific provisions for fuel economy (CAFE standards) or for tax provisions; these are to be added after the Commerce Committee and the Finance Committee, respectively hold hearings and produce language.  
 
As always please do not hesitate to contact us with your thoughts, questions or comments.

Introduction of Daschle-Bingaman Energy Legislation

Statement by David M. Nemtzow
President
Alliance to Save Energy
December 5, 2001

""This legislation offers nice appetizers, but we await the main course. 
""We commend Senators Daschle and Bingaman for their leadership in pulling together national energy legislation - legislation that, when complete, can play a vital role in strengthening America's economy, national security, and environmental protection. 
""We applaud the provisions to strengthen air conditioner energy efficiency and lower energy bills for federal facilities. We appreciate the sponsors' commitment to include provisions to significantly improve vehicle fuel efficiency, which is essential to help lessen our dangerous dependence on foreign oil. In addition, the bill that goes to the Senate floor must include tax incentives for highly efficient homes, cars and other products, to stimulate the economy. We also call upon the Senate to include strong efficiency provisions in the electricity title. 
""We look forward to the 'main course' - vehicle fuel efficiency and tax incentives - when the Senate considers this important legislation.""
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
Alliance to Save Energy
Analysis of the Daschle-Bingaman Energy Legislation
The energy efficiency provisions of the Daschle-Bingaman bill would save millions of dollars and avoid the need to build hundreds of power plants by 2020. It is imperative that the Commerce committee recommend a substantial increase in vehicle fuel economy standards to help wean our nation from its growing dependence on foreign oil, and that the Finance committee include energy efficiency tax incentives that will stimulate the economy and strengthen electricity reliability. 
The following provisions are not in the bill today: 
Vehicle Fuel Economy: No provision in the energy debate can decrease our dependence on foreign oil as much as vehicle fuel economy. Current studies show that we can increase fuel economy to 40 mpg and save nearly 2 million barrels of oil per day by 2012. Not only will this save consumers thousands over the life of their vehicle, but it will also reduce our oil dependence and help protect our environment.
Tax Incentives: The tax title should include incentives for the construction of highly efficient new homes and commercial buildings, significant upgrades for existing homes, and the purchase of hybrid vehicles, household appliances, and other products. Tax incentives serve the dual purpose of speeding the use of energy-efficient products and practices as well as educating builders, home owners, businesses, and consumers about the economic benefits of greater energy efficiency. 
Electricity: Strong energy efficiency measures in the electric sector can reduce by as much as half the number of power plants we will have to build over the next 20 years to meet future demand. Beyond product energy efficiency standards, this bill does not include any significant provision to go after this huge potential for energy savings. While formulating an aggressive policy has snagged over federal-state jurisdiction issues, it is critical that the Congress continue to work this out before the bill comes to the Senate floor.

The following elements are in the bill as introduced:
Product Standards: The bill expands energy efficiency standards by legislating standards or directing rulemakings on new standards for seven new classes of products, and it directs that the standard calling for a 30% increase in residential central air conditioners efficiency be implemented as published last January. 
Federal Energy Management: The federal government is the biggest energy user in the world -wasting over $1 billion annually on its inefficient energy consumption. By strengthening energy goals and accountability, ensuring that buildings and products purchased are energy efficient, and providing for a Federal Energy Bank to fund efficiency improvements. These provisions will save millions of taxpayer dollars a year. 
Other provisions: Additional savings are expected from other provisions promoting efficiency in schools, Energy Star labeling, and real time pricing.

"Ritalin Conference","Prescribing Ritalin: Who Decides?Doctors or Lawyers?

Monday, June 18, 2001, 9:30 a.m.*Noon
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI

     The medical community has undertaken a vigorous debate about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At one extreme are doctors, psychologists, and others who question whether clinicians are ""medicalizing"" childhood.   At the other pole are doctors who eagerly prescribe medications for youngsters at the slightest hint of trouble. Nonetheless, while over diagnosis and over prescribing are legitimate concerns, the consensus among mental health professionals is that ADHD exists and that stimulant therapies like Ritalin are effective.
     A legal debate has now been added to the medical one. Trial lawyers representing a class of parents whose children were diagnosed with ADHD have filed lawsuits in several states against the maker of Ritalin and the American Psychiatric Association.  They allege that the two conspired to ""create"" a disease to hype the benefits of the drug.  This conference will include an overview of the ADHD controversy and an examination of the implications of the ADHD litigation, followed by a question and answer period.

"RALLY AGAINT TERRORISM","                         MEDIA RELEASE
FROM: THE FATIMA CENTER, 266 Elmwood Ave., Buffalo, NY 14222
CONTACT: Coralie Graham, 905-871-7607 or coraliegraham@softcom.ca
OR WEBSITE: www.fatima.org
26 October 2001 - FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATE

""RALLY AGAINST TERRORISM"" SET FOR NEW YORK
Mid-November prayer campaign targets 6 million Catholics

Thousands of Catholics in New York and around the world believe
that the terrorist attack against the World Trade Center was
prophesied by the Blessed Virgin Mary to three shepherd children
at Fatima, Portugal, on July 13th, 1917. A Rally Against
Terrorism, to be held at New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, from
Saturday, November 10th through Monday, November 12th, will offer
New Yorkers the chance to do something positive to make world
leaders listen to the Fatima Message.
     The Blessed Virgin Mary said, ""If My requests are not
granted ... the good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have
much to suffer, various nations will be annihilated."" According
to Father Nicholas Gruner, the ""Fatima Priest"", this foretells
tragic events like those of September 11th. ""This is it!"", he
says, ""This is what Our Lady tried to warn us about.""
     The Rally Against Terrorism is being held in New York
because, the organizers say, of the nearly 300 million Americans
who are at risk of annihilation, New Yorkers should be the most
aware of the death and destruction which can be rained on us from
the skies or delivered through the mail. The only thing we can do
to protect ourselves, they say, is to pray and campaign for
obedience to the Message of Fatima.
     Attenders at the rally will hear seven distinguished
speakers, including Father Gruner, explain the simple, step-by-
step instructions Our Lady gave us for averting an even worse
disaster. ""Everything else has been tried,"" the Fatima Priest
says. ""We have nothing to lose, and world peace to gain, by
insisting that the Pope and all the bishops do what Our Lady of
Fatima has commanded."" Participants will be urged to play their
part in making this happen.
     There will also be opportunities to join in Masses, Rosaries
and other prayerful devotions offered up in remembrance of those
who have died and for the protection of the living.
     Admission to the Rally Against Terrorism is free. Sessions
are scheduled from 8:45 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sunday
and Monday, November 10th through 12th, at New York's Hotel
Pennsylvania, 401 - 7th Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets.
Further information can be found on the Fatima Website:
www.fatima.org.
                                                            - 30 -
NOTE TO MEDIA: We especially invite members of the press--
including electronic media as well as print- to attend and cover
the Rally Against Terrorism. For more information, contact Arthur
Skinner or Coralie Graham at the Fatima Center, telephone 1-866-

"A dissapointed stockholder","
I have been an Enron stockholder for several years  and I am very disappointed with the events of the last two weeks.  I find  the allegations of accounting irregularities incredible.  I would like to  know how closely the board had been monitoring the activities of the CFO and  whether it approved the partnerships that have led to the SEC investigation and  the dramatic decline in the company's stock price.  I would suggest that  the compensation of senior management may be too heavily weighted towards  bonuses (giving some the incentive to manipulate the numbers to increase their  bonuses) and not heavily weighted enough towards stock options.  I would  hope in the future the goals of the board and senior management will be aligned  with stockholders (increasing shareholder value).  While I know it is not  reason to have expected the stock price to stay in the high 80s, I consider the  drop in the last two weeks (apparently as the result of fraud) to be  inexcusable.  I believe the board owes all stockholders an explanation that  will finally clear the air about this mess (maybe the markets will trust Enron  again if it replaces evasion with candor).  Please help return credibility  and ethics to this company, which apparently are badly needed.

"Re: Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  It makes me even more PROUD to be an ENRON employee and know we are helping to provide support to our fellow countrymen during this tragedy and the recovery process.

Subject:	Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy


The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

POWER BRIEFS
FRIDAY, JUNE 1, 2001



* * * DELIVERING ON THE STRATEGY  - On Tuesday, May 30th, NewPower celebrated a record-breaking day in customer sign ups. Between the Charlotte and Herndon facilities, and the company's outbound telemarketing efforts, NewPower booked more than 1,300 accounts for the day!  Approximately 572 new customers called in to our center to come onboard for a gas plan, while approximately 390 called in for electric.  Total (gas and electric) residential outbound telemarketing efforts for the day brought in approximately 287 new customers, while outbound telemarketers enrolled approximately 63 new small commercial customers.  Since August, NewPower has enrolled roughly 120,000 gas and electric customers.  The count for the end of June is estimated at 124,000 (this does not take into account Tuesday's remarkable results).  This is the beginning of great things to come for NewPower's marketing and customer contact efforts.   Please share the great news with contractors and consultants.

CHENEY SAYS DESPITE SENATE SHIFT, LONG-TERM ENERGY POLICY NEEDED - [Oil & Gas Journal, May 25.]  US Vice-Pres. Dick Cheney Friday said policy makers should not yield to political expediency and continue ignoring the nation's long-term energy needs. http://ogj.pennnet.com/articles/web_article_display.cfm?Section=OnlineArticles&ARTICLE_CATEGORY=TOPST&ARTICLE_ID=102299

MASSACHUSETTS ELECTRIC FIRMS ASK REGULATORS TO RAISE RATES - [Boston Globe, May 26.]  Two big utilities that serve electric customers in Central Massachusetts yesterday filed for fuel charge increases for residential customers. The rate increases being sought by Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Co. and Massachusetts Electric Co. apply to ""standard offer"" service and follow the filing a week ago by NSTAR Electric for fuel charge increases in its standard offer and default service generation rates. Massachusetts Electric, a retail arm of National Grid USA in Westboro, also filed yesterday seeking to increase its standard offer by the same amount -- 1.23 cents -- from 5.401 per kWh to 6.631 cents per kWh.  The rate increase would add $6.15 to the monthly bill of typical residential customer using 500 kilowatts, pushing it from $56.54 to $62.69. http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CoW8Qqaicr0WTruXfq1rssum&FQ=%22fitchburg%20gas%22&Nav=na-search-&StoryTitle=%22fitchburg%20gas%22 

ELECTRICITY-CHOICE PROMOTION PROGRAM STUDY IN MISCUES - [Columbus Dispatch, May 27.]  If you listen to the people who run Ohio Electric Choice -- the state's electricity-deregulation program -- the marketing plan has been a success. According to one survey, 62 percent of Ohioans are aware of the plan to allow them to choose their electricity provider. That compares with 38 percent who knew of the plan before a multimillion-dollar public-relations and advertising campaign began last year.  But in real terms, the $11.2 million being spent statewide during the first 12 months of the five-year plan doesn't seem to have produced many tangible results. So far, only 150,000 residential customers in northern Ohio and 500 more in the central and southern parts of the state have switched suppliers.  There's been more success with community-driven efforts -- and with little noticeable assistance from the statewide promotional dollars. http://libpub.dispatch.com/cgi-bin/documentv1?DBLIST=cd01&DOCNUM=23614&TERMV=31224:6:31289:6:51808:6:


TEXAS PUC CHAIRMAN GAINS FEDERAL ENERGY POST - [Associated Press, May 27.] The Senate has approved President Bush's nomination of Pat Wood, chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Also approved for the panel was Nora Brownell, a member of Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission. The two were unanimously approved Friday. http://www.dallasnews.com/politics/378308_wood_27nat.ART.html 

POWER FIRM CHIEF LISTS SOLUTIONS FOR CRISIS - [Los Angeles Times, May 27.] Kenneth Lay, the head of Houston-based Enron Corp., handed out a four-page plan detailing his solution to California's energy crisis at a meeting with Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other state business and political leaders at a Beverly Hills hotel May 17. http://enehou-dj01.corp.enron.com/viewarticle.asp?folderid=8&AN=LATM0114700482 

BIZ SCHOOL GRADS REDISCOVER ENERGY - [Reuters, May 27.] Getting a job in the staid energy business hasn't exactly been considered the pinnacle of success for ambitious business school graduates.  Maybe it should be, since a national energy crisis makes conditions ripe for a resurgence of interest in the industry from both newly minted MBAs and experienced executives. http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/010527/business_energy_jobs_dc.html 

AGL TO SHUT OFF 4,000 MORE CUSTOMERS - [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, May 29.] Nearly a quarter of a million Georgia households are on Atlanta Gas Light Co.'s turnoff list, almost two months after expiration of a Public Service Commission-ordered moratorium on disconnections of natural gas service.  That's 16 percent of the 1.5 million homes and businesses in the state that purchase natural gas from unregulated marketers and are supplied through AGL's pipeline system. Most of the accounts on the disconnection list will never be actually turned off because customers will pay their bills or make payment arrangement with marketers. http://www.accessatlanta.com/partners/ajc/newsatlanta/0529gas.html 

DON'T TURN BACK CLOCK, MASS. URGED - [Worcester Telegram & Gazette, May 29.] A bill  would put Massachusetts on daylight-saving time year-round in an effort to save energy. 
Proposed by state Rep. William G. Greene, D-Billerica, it comes as skyrocketing electricity prices force California and other states to consider the change, too. http://www.telegram.com/news/page_one/savetime1.html 

TAPPING POWER OF SUPPLY, DEMAND - [Philadelphia Inquirer, May 30.] Regulating markets so they are more efficient will always involve controversial issues and politically charged decisions. But those are the right issues to argue about. The real energy policy question should be how - not whether - to make the market work. http://inq.philly.com/content/inquirer/2001/05/30/business/CASS30.htm?template=aprint.htm 

COURT DECLINES ENERGY PRICE CAP - [Associated Press, May 30.] Gov. Gray Davis threatened to sue the federal government for help in his state's power crisis after an appeals court declined to order energy regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices. http://cnniw.yellowbrix.com/pages/cnniw/Story.nsp?story_id=21142293&ID=cnniw&scategory=Utilities 

CALIFORNIA'S DAVIS PRAISES BUSH DIRECTIVE ON NATURAL GAS - [Oil & Gas Journal, May 30.] California Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday praised President George W. Bush's directive to investigate high natural gas prices in the state, but confirmed they remained far apart on the ""big enchilada"" of temporary electricity price relief. http://ogj.pennnet.com/articles/web_article_display.cfm?Section=OnlineArticles&ARTICLE_CATEGORY=Elect&ARTICLE_ID=102547 


CUSTOMER SIZE, INCOME KEY TO DECIDING TO PARTICIPATE IN RETAIL CHOICE: NARUC - [Electric Power Daily, May 31.]  Customer size and income are two key factors affecting participation in retail choice programs for gas and electricity.

OF INTEREST * * * WHAT THEY'RE SAYING - FINANCIAL ANALYSTS ON THE COMPANY'S FIRST QUARTER 2001 RESULTS
""NewPower Holdings remains an attractive Long Term Buy as the first nationally branded provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in the United States.  Unlike traditional utilities, which have service areas defined by geography, NPW is targeting select opportunities in deregulated markets throughout the country? We believe this remains an attractive high growth business proposition, particularly with a fully-funded business plan trading at approximately twice book value."" - J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

""NewPower continues to grow with lower-than-expected costs, driven by strong growth in their Internet marketing efforts and their ability to acquire portfolios of customers at attractive prices?We like the concept.  We think timing is right for investing in the newly emerging Competitive Retail Energy industry?Being a first mover in this business in very important.  In our view, NewPower has clearly established itself as a credible first mover."" - Salomon Smith Barney

Lora: I thought several of the reports in the Kamen column in today's  
Washington Post were of interest based on our past contacts which you may  
want to share with Enron officials concerned with those areas. 
(1) Speculation that Otto Reich's nomination for Assistant Secretary of State  
for the Western Hemisphere is in trouble with Senator Joe Biden taking over  
as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Further speculation that  
the Bush Administration may be forced to withdraw the nomination and consider  
replacing it with Crisencio Arcos, a former US ambassador now working for AT  
and T out of Miami. I have met him several times and chaired a BCIU panel  
with him as a participant; Anne Patterson, current US ambassador to Colombia  
who I also know; and, I would add the possibility of Donna Hrinak who I know  
is held in high regard. Doubt that decision will be made for several more  
weeks. 
Further in the column in the information the Nancy Brinker of Dallas (I don't  
know her) is to be nominated as US ambassador to Hungary. Enron has a  
business in Hungary and has been trying to expand interests; our old friend  
Doug Hartwick to be nominated for Laos (you will recall that we tried to help  
him last year to get Senator Bob Smith to remove a ""hold"" over the Senator's  
upset with the State Department not being aggressive enough about the MIA  
issue); and, my longtime friend Tom Hubbard, former US ambassador to the  
Philippines to be US ambassador to South Korea (Enron's Darrell Kinder may be  
interested to know this information). 
Can you kindly check the White House political office to see if they have a  
contact number for Richard ""Rich"" Bond? Ken Mehlman's office may be able to  
tell you. Rich did work for us and could possibly be helpful to me in pushing  
my own interests. He's been in the papers and on the tube several times  
commenting on the Jim Jeffords switch. 
We're leaving for our Delaware house about midday today and plan to return on  
Sunday or Monday. 
Thanks. 
Joe

"Fund raiser for Enron","Dear Mr. Lay,

My manager and I were discussing the possibility of doing a fund raiser for Enron.  We contributed an absorbant amount of money to charities this year and last, would it not be possible to raise money to help our company.  Do a little belt tightening.  We could do without the Christmas party, do without our bonuses and next year at this time, when we are back on top, it would be a sweeter glory knowing that the employees helped turn everything around.  I have spoken with my HR rep and several other employees about this possibility and we feel that we would be able to raise a substantial amount of money.  Please let me know what your view on this would be and we will work on what steps we need to take to make it happen.

Thank you for your time.

Asunto: RE: Lay It On the Line Survey Results


Ken,
Sorrry by my late answer. I am working for Enron since March of this year. I am knwing the Company and I thing that is a very good Company. Now, we are living a very difficult moment around the world and here, we have passing the worst crisis that I have known, but I thrust that next year will be better and we will be able to grow up in South America.
 
 Well, about the 5 questions that you asked, I think:

The Stock are in lowest price. My expectation is that they will increase their value. 
The PRC is very important if every people act with sincerity and if the high level of the Company use that information with criteria to acomodate the employees on the correct position according their skills. 
My moral is optimistic and I transmit the same at the other 17 employee of the Plant. I am committed with Enron and I will work with the objective to improve the performance of the business. 
Localy the image of the Company is very well. Furthermore, we permanent recomending at our employees on this matter. I am sure that the image of the Company is according the image that their employees shows inside and outside the Plant. 
Enron is a Company that have all support that any person can needs. I have had experience when I have needed anything and I have received the support and the respect of people from many places. Enron have a lot of people that are very skills in many issues and they are available to assist in any time.

Many thanks to allow to express my thought.

Best Regards,

Roberto Volont?

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:

---     A decline in the overall market and economy;

---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;

---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;

---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and

---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---     Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.

---     We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.

We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:

---     Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.

--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:

---     Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.

---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.

---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.

---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.

---     We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.

Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.

---     We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.

---     Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:

---     We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <<http://home.enron.com>>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.

--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.

---     Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.

---     We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.

---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Please is there anything we can do?, maybe get together our own finances to help Enron.  What if there was a way we (The Enron Family) could gather the funds needed to stay ENRON.  We're pretty much will to do whatever it takes.  Enron is our company and we're here.  Noone asked the employees if they were willing to help out.  We can all attempt to get loans and give the money to Enron.  If you'd ask, you'd be suprised as to the respone you'd get.  We love the company and are willing to do what it takes.  Enron is Enron.

I hope this prosposal gets address in some way.  We're here to help and serve you Mr. Lay.

"A little good news","Dad,
I met with Peter Veruki at the Jones School of
Administration at Rice last week and we had a great
meeting. Our timing is a little off (they want someone
next spring and I want a position by Jan), but we are
still talking.
There is also a position open for Director of
Development of Rice University and I have contacted
Malcolm Gillis and Christie Patrick happens to be
meeting with him today so she is going to mention that
I am interested.
There are also a couple of positions at UH which I am
going to look into, so I am hopeful something good
will come of all this. Christie Patrick has been my
one woman promoter, she is wonderful.
I'll keep you posted.
I love you Dad,

"Confidential Question","Dear Ken, 

I'm not sure quite were to turn but was hoping you could assist me.  I would like to keep this confidential especially regarding the New York Office.  As my request has nothing to do with the people in this office or the group  they are wonderful

I've been with Enron since '97 and I relocated up to Connecticut to work with the New Power Company when I thought that the Enron employees would stay Enron employees.  Afterwards of course we all were changed to NewPower employees.  After a couple of months I made the move back to Enron and went to  the New York office and work with the Enron Metals group here at 53rd street. (It was never my intention to leave Enron)

Since the bombing I feel very displaced and my husband and I would really like to come back to Houston and was wondering if you could help me.  I was on the trading floor working with Dave Delainey's group when he was in ENA and also was the Exec Secretary/Coordinator with the MWB group in George Warsoff's group.  

I would appreciate it very much if you were able to assist/guide me.

Sincerely,

Teri

"Enron Situation and Technology For All: A Note from Will Reed","Greetings Technology For All Board Members:

Several of you have seen the announcement today that Enron received notice
from Dynegy, Inc. that it is terminating the merger aggreement between it
and Enron.  In addition, Standard and Poor's, Moody Investors Service and
Fitch, Inc. downgraded Enron's long-term debt to below investment grade.

Technology For All has been the recipient of significant support from Enron
as a national sponsor.  We are grateful for Enron's support and the support
of Ken Lay.  We acknowledge the enormous credibilty that support has given
us to expand our vision and mission.  We now have direct supportive
relationships with 200+ Community Technology Centers in 15 U.S. cities
including our local TFA affiliates in Houston, Denver and Cleveland, Ohio.
We estimate that 30,000-50,000 persons each week are positively impacted by
these program partnerships.

With the Enron announcements today in the press, I wanted to inform you of
my actions in response to these developments.

Enron's commitment to Technology For All was a commitment of three items
over three years: Cash, Connectivity on the Enron Network and in-kind
contributions of hardware and/or other services.
The commitment was to expire at the end of 2002. Therefore, 2/3 of the cash
commitment has been received by TFA. We have received some in-kind
contributions, but never finalized the provision of connectivity on the
Enron Network. To date, continuing connectivity has generously been provided
by FYI-Net, a privately owned company of which Scott Yeager and members of
his family are the largest stockholders.  Therefore, while significant to
TFA, the Enron developments will not shutdown our vital mission to bring
technology to underserved communities.  Our vision continues to be focused
on using technology as a tool with the disadvantaged and underserved to
bring about sustainable and meaningful change in their communities.

Over the past several weeks as Enron situation has unfolded, we have done
and are doing several things to preserve our core missional focus.

1)  In expectation of reduced revenue, we have been cutting expenses
significantly and will be announcing several layoffs in the next few days.
I have taken a voluntary 10% reduction in income and Douglas Caldwell has
taken a voluntary 5% reduction in income.

2)  With the assistance of a ""Capacity Building"" tool developed by McKinsey
& Co. for the Venture Philanthropy Partners Group out of Washington DC., we
are in the midst of strategic planning effort that will help us rewrite our
business plan.  This effort will help us focus on the capacity building
activities most vital to our core mission and develop a ""go forward"" plan.

3)  We are intensely developing other relationships with corporate and
foundation funders that are project specific and results oriented.   Almost
all of my time will be focused on fund raising activites.  We have several
potential relationships under development. The diversification of our donor
basis is criticial to the future of our mission. To set an example for
potential donors, in addition to the reduction in salary, my 2001 gifts to
TFA equal 1% of my annual income.

4)  I have named Douglas Caldwell to serve in an expanded position of
leadership as the Chief Operating Officer. As the COO, Douglas now has
responsibility and authority for the day-to-day operations of Technology For
All and also for Technology For All-Houston. This decision was made in
consultation with Jack Trotter, Scott Yeager and Jack Clark.   As some of
you already know, Douglas brings many skills to this new role. In addition
to his numerous contacts with potential funding sources, he is able to see
the big picture of our common vision while at the same time is also able to
drill down to the details required to accomplish it.  He is also a person
who manages resources well.  While this is always important, this is
especially important during this time of economic uncertainty.  We must be
good stewards of our available resources.

5.	It is my recomendation to the TFA Board that we establish advisory
boards in each TFA city and at the national level to help carry the TFA
banner and to raise the dollars necessary to support our core programs and
activies.  The TFA-Houston Board of Directors unanimously affirmed this
recomendation for Houston.  I solicit your support of this recomendation on
a national level and your suggestions of persons who may be potential
advisory board members.

6.	We are in the final stages of preparation for a larger three year
proposal for a Houston Workforce Development Initiative that will utilize
our SmartForce content in collaboration with over 100 of our community
program partners.  It is our intent to pitch this first to Houston's Brown
Foundation for a three year commitment. The support of our board will be
vital to the success of this proposal.  Mr. Valenti, I will be calling you
and others to assist with this.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding my plans.  I look forward
to your comments and reflections.

Regards,

Will

give this office a call at 202/298-785-0296.  Either Cindy Cassidy or I will
be glad to help.

"Summary of NPC Meeting, Washington, D.C.","Ken:

Pete van de Gohm and I attended the NPC meeting in Washington on June 6 where the final draft Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) subcommittee document was presented to the Secretary of Energy and the NPC membership.  The draft document was accepted and the final document is being prepared.

At your request, we are pleased to continue working with Archie Dunham and the NPC subcommittee to attack the next phase of the project, the development and implementation of an Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or ISAC.  The ISAC will be the tool in providing threat information to the industry and is the main focus of the CIP project.

This next phase may require the involvement of an Enron attorney and a business lead as the ISAC will likely take the form of an LLC or similarly structured entity.  We will address these as the need arises with Jim Derrick and Steve Kean.

We feel we have made a great contribution to the energy industry by moving this project forward, and we are eagerly looking forward to our continued involvement.

Regards,

Mike Hicks

Dear Phyllis,

Bless you for your care and concern.  I have forwarded on to Ken's office
and will get him to Aspen as soon as the smoke clears.  He is burning the
candle day and night with very little sleep.  I am praying hard for him and
Enron and know that he has the strength, wisdom, skills and courage to
persevere and succeed.

I will stay in touch.

Dear Linda,
So much for your quieter time of life.
After seeing the NY Times article yesterday, I am glad for Enron that
Ken is back at the helm; I trust he will persevere and be more than
successful in whatever he does.
I am concerned about his level of stress, and would highly recommend
that he keep up that anxiety control formula, taking two after meals
3x a day. I have stronger things in my arsenal if needed.
Also, perhaps when he is here sometime, I could check his blood
chemistry for stress factors and optimal brain function.
Warmest Regards,
Phyllis

Interest"" with Kojo Nnamdi on Wednesday November 7th.   Beierle, whose
research focuses on public participation in decisions about the
environment, will be talking about how the terrorist attacks of September
11th have derailed 'right to know' environmental protection programs on the
Internet. ""Public Interest"" is heard in 50 NPR stations nationwide. Beierle
will be part of a discussion and listener call-in to air between 1-2pm ET.

* Two new fellows have joined the RFF research team:

3) RFF New Publications
Fulfilling the Promise on Global Hunger
Religious fanaticism motivated the terror of September 11th, but poverty
and hunger remain the central obstacles to future world security. Over 800
million people remain chronically malnourished. In 1996, the United States
pledged with 185 other countries to halve this number by 2015. A new
research report by RFF's Mike Taylor and Jody Tick documents that this
commitment has not been backed by effective action. There has been no real
budget commitment, no focused leadership, and no accountability for
results. The report calls on President Bush to clearly define U.S.
interests in and objectives for global hunger and vest responsibility and
accountability for results in the Secretary of State and administrator of
the Agency for International Development.
Michael Taylor and Jody Tick | September 2001

Improving Regulation: Cases in Environment, Health and Safety
This new book from RFF Press focuses on challenges to regulatory policy
during a time of rapid technological and societal change. It also examines
the impact of organizational politics, science, technology, and performance
on regulation.
Paul S. Fischbeck and R. Scott Farrow, editors | August 2001
For more information go to: http://www.rff.org/books/index.htm

Discussion Papers:
""RFF and Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology Evaluating the StarLink
Corn Case"" StarLink - a type of bioengineered corn that produces its own
pesticide and was approved only for animal feed - was found in the human
food supply just over a year ago, prompting massive recalls of corn-based
products. Resources for the Future, in cooperation with the Pew Initiative
on Food and Biotechnology, is in the process of identifying and analyzing
the regulatory and public policy issues raised by the StarLink episode.

""State-Level Variation in Land-Trust Abundance: Could it Make Economic
Sense?""
Few economic analyses examine land trusts, their decisions, and the
land-trust ""industry,"" despite their growing importance. For example,
statistics on the wide variation in the number of trusts in different
regions of the United States raise questions about whether such variation
makes economic sense. This paper builds a model to identify the optimal
number of private conservation agents. The model depicts two competing
forces: regional spatial externalities in conservation benefits that
increase the efficiency of having fewer agents and organizational costs,
and fund-raising specialization, which increases the efficiency of having
more agents. Using state-level variables, we perform a count-data analysis
of the number of trusts conserving land in each state. We find that the
number of trusts actually observed is consistent with the optimal number of
trusts that is predicted by the model on the basis of the relative
importance of spatial externalities and organizational size in different
regions.

""An Economic Assessment of Space Solar Power as a Source of Electricity for
Space-Based Activities""
We develop a conceptual model of the economic value of space solar power
(SSP) as a source of power to in-space activities, such as spacecraft and
space stations. We offer several estimates of the value based on interviews
and published data, discuss technological innovations that may compete with
or be complementary to SSP, and consider alternative institutional
arrangements for government and the private sector to provide SSP.

"","Mr. Lay,

I wanted to send you a note to say I appreciate the way that you have been handling things.  I have alot of respect for you.  My name is Rebekah Rushing.  I consider myself an Enron grandbaby.  My mother, Helena Payne worked for HNG and then Enron for a total of 24 years.  She was an accounting clerk and retired in April of this year when the accounting group was outsourced.  Going through that process with my mother, was an eye opener for me, however after numerous meetings with her supervisor and the human resources department, I feel comfortable that Enron did a good job of taking care of her in that situation.  Her supervisor even made it possible for her to receive her 25 year grandfather clock.  The one thing that does trouble me is the fact that allot of the people that were around in Enron's beginning that we'll call the worker bee's (the people that you could count to get the job done behind the scenes) have lost alot due to the poor decisions that upper management have made.  My mother along with many others  in her situation were the people that this company could and still can count on, they are loyal to Enron and alot of them had the majority of their 401K invested in Enron stock.  This was the majority of their live savings, they do not have anything to fall back on. In my mother's case (as is the case with many other retired or soon to be retired Enron employees) she lost $300,000 in her 401K and only had a little over $400,000 in it to begin with.  I work with a lady that has been with Enron for 23 years and was looking forward to retiring within the next 5-6 years, but now she's not sure if she'll be able to, because she too lost alot in her 401K.  I realize that it's been said many times, a 401K is not a sure thing but the people that I'm referring to had been around for a long time, knew the track record of Enron, and showed their loyalty to the company.   The second thing that concerns me is that this same group of employees have the possibility of being faced with looking for a job.  Most of them are 50 years or older and have been with this company for many years.  They've survived all the different reorganizations because they've had great work ethic.  They weren't always the most 'innovative', but they've always been the most loyal and dependable.  Instead of their dream of retiring, they're now faced with the possibility of having to find another job.  Interviewing will not be as easy for them, because in some cases, they haven't had to interview for another company in quite some time.  I know the politically correct statement is that they will not be discriminated against because of their age, however statistics show that in some cases when a hiring supervisor has a younger candidate and a more mature candidate (45+), they usually will select the younger candidate.  They wouldn't admit to discrimination of age, but it does happen.

These are the people that my heart goes out to.  I wish that there was some way that these loyal and dedicated employees could be taken care of.  I admire you for your decision to waive your rights to the provision that you would have received.  I realize that everyone has lost something due to the events that have occurred, I just wish there was a way that the generation ahead of me that has been with Enron  could recoop a portion of what they've lost.  It the least that they deserve.     

Thank you for your time.

"EGM earnings from EOTT transaction","In today's eSpeak session you made the following comments: 
""To the best of my recollection, the only asset we sold in the second quarter to a subsidiary company was our Clean Fuels business, which we sold to EOTT, and on that transaction there was virtually no profit.""
In fact, EGM recognized $120 million in mark to market earnings from an offtake agreement that was inextricably linked to the sale.  The recognition of these earnings would not have been possible without the sale.  
My confidence in your integrity compells me to alert you of my concern with your statements from the eSpeak session.  I urge you to investigate the transaction further.  After you have done so, I believe you will agree with me that your statements appear misleading to anyone with a better understanding of the deal.

"I am behind you","Mr. Lay,

I only heard part of the employee meeting as I had to leave for the airport to return to Puerto Rico but wanted to say that I have all the confidence in the world that under your leadership Enron will return to the great company it is.  

We have all been through tough times (I use to be a land drilling contractor from 1979 to 1988). This company is sound, with good people who with the right leadership & direction can achieve the goal of  being the best company in the world.  

I have been working with Enron as a contractor since March 99 in Panama, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas (LNG project).  I report to Mariella Mahan and  Greg Curran.   I really enjoy working with Enron and can assure you that you and Enron will always have my loyalty & confidence.  

I am proud to say I work with Enron and want to do my part to bring this company back.

Sincerely,

Larry Kelley

HEALTH POLICY DISCUSSION
Is the Pharmaceutical Revolution Paying Off?

Tuesday, January 29, 2002, 10:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m.
National Press Club - Ballroom
529 14th Street, NW - 13th Floor, Washington, D.C.

The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research and the National Pharmaceutical Council invite you to a discussion about the costs and benefits of pharmaceuticals.

Over the past several years, questions about the value and appropriate use of pharmaceuticals have intensified nationwide. Are they worth it? Can we afford them? Federal and state policymakers need better insight on these issues as they consider ways to expand access to prescription drugs. So do employers, insurers, consumers, and health care providers who are weighing the costs and benefits of pharmaceuticals.

Discussion topics will include the effects of pharmaceutical expenditures on longevity and morbidity, as well as on depression treatment costs, and the effect of newer drugs on medical outcomes.

Please join us to learn more about recent research on the costs and benefits of pharmaceutical innovation and to discuss the economic impact these prescription drugs are having on our health care system. During lunch, an expert on pharmaceutical research will discuss the revolution in science and medicine, particularly in genomics.

"Our support/Best Wishes","
Dear Mr. Lay,
 
I just wanted to drop you a  note and personally wish you the best of luck with Enron Corp. through the  holidays and in the coming new year.  Although I am not a stockholder,  I've always believed that Enron Corp. was on the cutting edge of everything  that was good about the energy business, and what's right for Texas in  particular.
 
My wife works for the  American Heart Association here in Austin. She said you and your  company have been a long time and generous supporter of AHA.  Thank  you for that.  
 
As I was reading in the  Austin American Statesman this morning, I understand that you have gone to great  lengths to do ""the right thing"" for everyone  concerned.  I firmly believe  that you will come out of this situation on top and continue to prosper and  profit as always.
 
P.S.  I hope that my email moniker of  ""elduque"" didn't throw you.....I am not with any east coast competitor!  I  picked it up while watching a World Series game last year and thought it  appropriate at the time, when Yankee pitcher ""Elduque"" was busy striking  out the side. Here's hoping you can do the same!
 
 
 
Best Wishes For The Holiday Season!!
 
 
 
Respectfully,
 
 
Douglas Smith

"Letter Specifying Termination of Benefits","
Dear Ken, 
I was notified today that I am being terminated.  According to a lady (Trina) that I spoke to in Benefits, I will have health insurance through December 31, 2001.  Currently, my family is also covered by the Enron insurance. My daughter is a sophomore at NYU.  I can get insurance for her through NYU.  I will need, however, a letter from Enron, on Enron letterhead, indicating when my current insurance will expire.  Once I have the letter from Enron, NYU will initiate the paperwork to provide insurance coverage for my daughter. 
I asked Enron Benefits to provide such a letter.  The lady I spoke to said she would have to check with her supervisor.  I have not heard from either of them as of yet.  I realize you are very busy but I would be grateful if you could facilitate a letter being sent to me as soon as possible.  My daughter is planning to study abroad starting in January.  The Spanish consulate will require that we have adequate insurance.  My wife will be visiting the consulate on either 12/10 or 12/11 to present the necessary documentation for my daughter's study abroad.  It is imperative, therefore, that we receive the above mentioned letter from Enron as soon as possible.  My wife will take the Enron letter plus the NYU documentation to the consulate to verify to the consulate that my daughter will have adequate insurance coverage. 
I wish you the best in rebuilding Enron and I hope you and your family have a wonderful holiday. 
Sincerely, 
Elton E. Smith

I found him extraordinarily useful. For one thing, he is intelligent; for
another, perhaps as a consequence of the first, he doesn't over promise; for

certainly worth a serious hearing.

"Compensation distribution","Mr. Lay,

Reuters just had an article that said upon closing of the Dynegy deal, you will receive $80,000,000 which buys you out of your employment contract.

Is this true?

If so, since you said in your speech that we are all feeling this pain together, will there be a distribution of the $80,000,000 back to the people who's lives have been crushed and will receive no additional compensation.  It seems unjust that while the people who had nothing to do with the downfall get nothing, the people who were involved in the downfall continue to be well compensated.

I,  as a trader on the gas floor,  am sitting here at my desk still making all attempts to make money for the company, wondering if  I will be getting my next paycheck.  Then I read that you are getting an additional $80,000,000.  I, as well as my fellow employees, feel betrayed once again.  What is the old saying about kicking the dead horse?  The difference is that this horse is still barely breathing and your $80,000,000 just sucked out the final bit of life.

The management level you have been at provides you the inside scoop on all these bad deals and the ""pump and dump"" that senior management has done to Enron stock over the last years.  It is a disgrace the way you and your senior management have ruined so many peoples lives.  How could you not know that the company would be taking a fall when you signed back on.  Other CEO's coming back into companies under the same situation have accepted no compensation until the company gets back on its feet again.  It seems that you knew what was going to happen, and were able to milk Enron out of another 80 million dollars.

 I have learned a valuable lesson about how business really works.  As an employee, one should milk their company for everything they can get out of it no matter how many people are hurt.  Enron has been a cutthroat stab you in the back organization for a long time.  I always thought it was just my fellow employees doing every thing they could to get ahead.  I never realized that this was the creed that senior management lived by. Senior management must have been in their offices rolling on the floor every time some employee spoke up about trying to make vision and values a success.

You and your teams fine example has changed my life forever.  Aside from the fact that my kids will no longer be going to college, you have changed my thinking for ever.  I will never again believe anything my employers tell me.  I will never again put my company as a top priority.  It is a travesty what you have done to so many peoples lives.

Dear Mr. Lay,
 
I have no idea if this e-mail will reach you, but, I felt I would at least try.  My name is Jim Edwards and I am the CEO of Brittan Communications International, Inc., (BCI). For different reasons and on a scale that 1/1000th of that of Enron, BCI had to shut it's doors in the midst of a great deal of mis-understandings and information.  The people that got hurt by it caused me great emotional pain at many levels, for it was not my desire at any time to do anything except that it was good for them.  
 
One can feel very alone at a time like this and words can not describe all the feelings that go with an event like this for someone in your position.  I do feel that I can relate because of my experience with BCI.  Other than to tell you that you are not alone, and that you will survive this to go forward again, I can not say much that will help.  Take heart, hold on, and believe.  Prayer helps and I will say one for you. If for any reason you wish to talk my number is 281-558-6365, my e-mail is jgedwards@hotmail.com .

  SSBSC  TO KEY VOTE UPCOMING TRADE VOTE IN  HOUSE
SBSC Chairman Karen Kerrigan  sent a letter to Congress this week noting that SBSC would make the upcoming  vote (scheduled for December 6) on trade promotion authority (TPA) an SBSC ""key  vote,"" noting that ""a vote for TPA is a vote for small business.""  Kerrigan wrote: ""I wanted to take this  opportunity to express how vital passage of TPA is to America's small businesses  and entrepreneurs?  America's small  business and entrepreneurial sector are the engines of U.S. economic growth, but  our entrepreneurs will require a level playing and access to the world  marketplace if they are to maintain the level of job creation, innovation and  vitality that is so integral to the health of our overall economy.  Trade,  and specifically TPA, is a matter of common sense, sound economics and just  happens to be in our national  interest.""
 
SBSC strongly encourages our  members and supporters to contact their U.S. Representatives and urge them to  support TPA for President Bush.  A  great place to visit with the latest daily updates on the upcoming vote is the  Progress for America (PFA) website. SBSC has been closely working with PFA on  TPA and a host of other issues critical to the health and vitality of small  business.  Please visit their new  website, where you can sign a resolution in support of TPA for President Bush,  or send an e-mail message to your U.S. House Member.  You can send a message now by linking  to:  www.progressforamerica.org /1101/

"","Dear Ken,

I had the opportunity to talk to nearly all Foundation Board and Council
members. There is great enthusiasm about the decision to move next year's
Annual Meeting exceptionally from Davos to New York and, in such a way, to
underline the role of the Annual Meeting 2002 as a partnership platform to
elaborate a roadmap for the future and a comprehensive response to the
tragic events of 11 September. The key advice given was
- to make sure that we carry the spirit of Davos to New York
- that we make sure to have a strong international participation and
- that, finally, the key challenges are dealt with in a spirit of
cooperation and collaboration.
We need now your help and partnership to make sure that ""Davos in New York""
becomes not only a success, but a substantial contribution to fulfill our
mission: to improve the state of the world.

We will be back for operational matters.

With warmest regards,
Klaus

"**** Unconfirmed Explosions at French Chemical Plants","Media reports out of France indicate that explosions have just taken place at two chemical plants in the southern city of Tououse.  The main explosion reportedly took place at a plant that manufactures fuel for Arianespace, the European Space Agency's commercial arm.  Explosions have also been reported at a plant owned by Groupe SNPE, which manufactures propellants and explosives.  The incidents are reported to have involved deaths at the scene.

We have yet to acquire independent confirmation of the explosions, or whether terrorism is suspected.  We are in touch with military and intelligence sources, and will provide updates.

"Advice","Kenneth Lay
Enron Corp.

The reason I'm writing you is because I'm in a position of looking for
advice from someone who's already 'been there, done that'.  And you have
achieved what I am looking for which is to lead a company to success.

I started an online company in 1998 and about a year ago I decided to quit
my 'normal' job and go after my dream.  This last year has been an
incredible learning experience in starting and running a successful
business.  The main problem I'm facing today is that one year with minimal
profits has eaten into my financial cushion to the point that I am now faced
with a very big decision.  In order to support my new family I need more
cash-flow to simply pay the bills.

Of course I can always go work for another company since I have an
Engineering degree from the Colorado School of Mines as well as 5 years of
running an IT department in addition to my last few years of
Entrepreneurship.

I know in my heart that my place in this world is to lead the way and
succeed in the business world.  And while I have achieved great success
working for other people I know it isn't where I'm supposed to be.  But when
it comes to supporting my family I sometimes need to place my dreams and
desires on the back burner.

I have considered writing programs on a consulting basis to assist in
funding my company.  My skills as a programmer have led to a very different
way of designing applications in the sense that I have a great feel for the
bigger picture of what the program needs to accomplish and I'm then able to
put the code together in a very organized and timely manner.

So I guess that explains my situation pretty good.  I have a few choices:

1.  Continue my company using a few untapped financial resources such as my
retirement.

2.  Continue my company part time and write programs and develop web and
e-commerce solutions for other companies.

3.  Go work for another company.

And while I don't have any specific questions for you, any thoughts,
suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I would love to see us playing golf together someday at a big CEO
conference.

Here is a link to a few pictures so you know who you're talking to:

"Wind asset","Ken--

At the conclusion of our phone conversation, you indicated that I should get
back with you if we were having any difficulty in pursuing our interest in
acquiring the Enron wind business.  Knowing the many demands on your time, I
regret to have to come back to you.  However, despite repeated attempts, we
are still locked out of negotiations over the wind asset and have been
unable to receive information we've requested.  Our phone calls have been
returned, but information and/or a seat at the table have not been
forthcoming.

Can we discuss this again by pbone?  Alternatively, as I suggested in a note
to you on Monday, we stand ready at any moment to come visit you in person
about this if you might have even 15 minutes for us.

Again, apologies for coming back to you about this.  But, it would be
extremely helpful if you could assist us in being able to move forward on
our interest in bidding on this business.

Many thanks!

"MR. LAY! GUESS WHAT?!","
I was just reading over some verses I have posted around my cube and I noticed the Luke 10:27 ""You shall love the Lord you God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength and with all your mind....""
All of the sudden, it wasn't ""You gotta do this...."" But God saying, ""I'm gonna love you so much you are going to love me with all your heart, all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind.... I'm gonna make you fall in love with me!"" 
I was just thinking how much God is ""winning my heart"" in all of this. 
I JUST LOVE Jesus, don't you???!!!! There REALLY is NONE like our GOD!!!!!! 
Hope you heard about how God is ministering to your ""flock"". The Astros and Enron Field are hosting a Job Fair. KSBJ is somehow participating and also offering ministerial services for coping. They are in such good hands. God is so good. The Good Shepherd.

I had a 	gentleman on our floor a few weeks back, that told me he had worked for Enron a while back, he said the most damaging thing that hurts Enron in 	the public eye, is the fact that a person can seldom talk to the same person in a department more than a few times before their contact in that 	department moves to another department or leaves. He said it gives the public a feeling of insecurity in trusting a company where the employees 	move around so much. I hope this doesn't upset you, I just thought I would let you know what one gentlemen told me regarding the company. I 	absolutely love the foundation that you have built Enron on, and I only hope that more company's follow suit. Have a wonderful day.

"May God Bless you and your family- We are with you","Mr. Lay:

In view of the events of past weeks surrounding Enron's stock, I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you. I will try to keep this brief. First of all, I want to say that  you are doing a terrific job. With your leadership we will turn this around soon. May God bless you and your family so you can continue leading this great company out of this crisis. I have been with the company for almost 21 years. I remember the difficult days that we have been through during this time . Particularly I remember like yesterday when I used to be in Omaha and you came there and, talked to all of us and gave us hope and your commitment to turn things around in those uncertain and difficult days after the merger and promised to make this a great company. We all rallied behind you and we turned this company into one of the greatest company in the world. We are with you now, and with your leadership we will turn this around again. For most of us, Enron is not just a place to work. It is part of us.  It is our family. It is our life. In the current situation the pain we feel is the same as if one of our loved one was seriously sick and we did not know what to do except to follow the advise of the doctor. We will follow your advise and give you our 200% . On a personal level for me this a very emotional and painful time. I have grown with this company that has given me great opportunities.  Currently I am working in Bolivia as president of Gas TransBoliviano and feel perhaps there is something I should be doing to help in this situation. Mr. Lay, If there is anything I can do above and beyond my current job, please let me know. You have my commitment and I will not disappoint you. Please consider me like one of those guys in NY showing up with shovels to help after the WTC disaster. I am hoping that I will be called upon. Again, may God bless you and your family. Look forward to seeing you in San Antonio.

With Kind Regards,

Nasim Khan

"Anniversary Luncheon","Dear Mr. Lay,

I am one of many long time employees who has lost my life's savings and my kid's college fund.

Today I am receiving my 15 Years of Service Award and having my Anniversary luncheon.  Would you like to attend?  My Department would appreciate a candid picture of how this could have happened to such a great company.  I have gone through tough times and many good times with Northern Natural Gas, InterNorth and Enron.  I was always so proud to be a part of this company. 

Should I have seen this coming?  I was just another sheep following and believing everything our leaders, Skilling, said regarding the probability of Enron's stock splitting.  I didn't play the market but looked at my 401K stock purchases as long term retirement and continued to put money into the 401K even when we (my family) were struggling to do so.

I too grew up on a farm in Missouri.  I was raised under the same Midwest rooted values and the strict convictions of my father that you did not take charity or borrow money.  He also preached that to sue was not the way to correct a wrong.  I was always a little prideful that you too were a Midwesterner, with those rooted values of high integrity, compassion, and honesty.

Life goes on.  I hope to continue my employment though all of this and will continue to be a great employee, only now for Dynegy.  This  is also a concern since I am in my late 40's.  My job, my kid's education, and my retirement weigh heavily along with the atmosphere we are all currently living in.  

This reality is a struggle with many unanswered questions and devastating concerns for the future.  

I would appreciate your thoughts.  

Respectfully yours,

"The Lord has sent me to pray over Enron.","
Mr. Lay, 
On the 28th, the Lord impressed upon me to begin praying over Enron at Enron. My daily prayers started on that first email but I began yesterday to do what people call ""prayer walking"" and will continue for 16 days. It is based on something I read in 2 Chronicles 29:17 about Hezekiah cleansing the temple. It took a total of 16 days. 
The Lord impressed me to read Psalms 119 yesterday and Mr. Lay, the Lord did NOT condemn you in my heart. It was as if He was telling me of His heart towards you. You know how the Bible tells us that the Holy Spirit will convict us of righteousness too. It was like that. You and I know it is His righteousness but isn't it wonderful that God's heart for you is not accusing. That is the enemy. God does not send the people that are holding up signs and railing accusations. He sends people like me. People that He has given a burden for your needs.
When He first impressed me to do this, I wanted Him to give me scripture that would back this up. I have been taught that you always have to compare what you are thinking back to God's Word. Well, He gave me 1 scripture the first day. 
Galations 6:2  ""Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."" 
Then this morning He gave me this one. Now it may not make much sense to you but it is one that the Lord had given me as a personal word for me. It is Isaiah 58 12. The part about ""...you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls...""  I know He means that for me to KNOW that He has sent me.
You are my brother in Christ. God has called me to encourage you in this time. God is madly in love with you and wants you to call upon Him NO MATTER what you are feeling. 
I was listening to Tony Evans this morning on a tape and he was talking about who God is. He talked about how God is infinitely powerful, infinitely kind, infinitely everything that is Him..... For God to save you, your company, your employees, is NOT hard for God. With God all things are possible. Read Matthew 17:20, Matthew 19:26, Mark 10:27, and Luke 1:37. 
Let's believe God because He is able and He wants to save. He always wants to save. Even when he humbles us, he only does it so that we will call out to Him and remember that HE ALONE IS GOD. He has made us for HIMSELF. For HIS glory. 
God and God alone has sent me to pray for his mighty hand to deliver. That is what He is constantly confirming to me in scripture. I don't know what it will look like but it will BE GOD and YOU WILL KNOW it. He is not saving for your name but for HIS. 
Mr. Lay, Jeremiah 18:1-12 is something you might need to read. If I really love you as a brother in Christ, I want to remind you that we can NOT be afraid of the hand of the Lord. It is always for our good. You as a man of God know this and I hope you are encouraged that there is ALWAYS HOPE in JESUS. NO MATTER WHAT. This is such an encouraging passage because it tells us that ALL we have to do is turn to God and call on Him. 
I know you must be very weary. I am praying for the employees to supernaturally be productive. For the Lord to knit their hearts together and to minister forgiveness. Not to accuse. 
I haven't read any news yet. Remember I don't have TV or read the newspaper. I am sending this to you without being afraid of what I will read on the internet. 
Great is His faithfulness......

"Shipping Financial Services Corp.","Ken:

I reviewed the letter from Mr. S. Huey Long that you forwarded to me regarding his suggestion that you discuss with Mr. Ravi N. Tikoo the Dabhol situation and more specifically the Lakshmi LNG carrier and in return agree to let him bid on future LNG carrier chartering or financing business.  As you probably recall, we are a minority investor in the Lakshmi, with Mitsui OSK Lines the majority investor and operator of the vessel.  We are not really in a position to control decision making with respect tot he vessel and are currently maneuvering to get Mitsui to buy out our position.  Accordingly, I do not think there is anything productive to be gained from Mr. Tikoo with respect to the Lakshmi.  As to whether he can help more generally with respect to India, I defer to your judgement.  I think we are already well connected and engaging any additional intermediaries carries more risk in terms of confusion, mixed messages or inappropriate behavior from a FCPA perspective.  If you would like I can have our LNG group respond with a polite letter informing him that we are not currently considering any additional LNG carriers, but that we would be happy to allow him to arrange a meeting at such time in the future as we have shipping needs.

"Follow up from our meeting","Ken--

I just wanted to thank you again for inviting me to Houston, and more
importantly, for the support you and Enron are providing to Technology for
All and the joint TFA/SmartForce project.  I believe that we are going to
help make a real difference.

I also wanted to follow up our brief conversation, where we discussed
getting some of our people together with your people at Enron (I believe
that you indicated that your head of HR would be a good start) to see
whether there are ways in which SmartForce can help Enron achieve some of
its business objectives around learning and training.

I would appreciate it if you would have someone email to me the contact
information for whomever it would be appropriate for us to approach.  I'll
take care of the rest from my end.  Thanks again.

Regards,

Greg

Cheryl,

  Things have been a whirlwind
since the coronation, but I am loving every minute of
it! I stayed for the entire Wrangler National Finals
Rodeo and spent a lot of time talking to the media and
the sponsors. I was asked on several occasions during
interviews with the press about whether or not I am a
person of faith, and I was very happy to have the
opportunity to give my testimony. I told them that I
knew that I would not have been awarded the
opportunity to speak with them if the Lord wasn't at
work in my life and that I had been very blessed with
wonderful parents who had raised me in a Christian
home.
 I am leaving tomorrow morning to go to Waco for
the Texas Circuit Finals, and I will be flying to
Denver next week. I am really excited that one of my
first appearances is going to be in Houston so that I
get to see all of you! Cheryl, again thank you very
much. You are truly an inspiration to me. I will see
you soon!

Love,
Kara

"dynergy planned for merger to fail all along","I'm not sure to whom I should tell this information.
 
While at an appointment on Friday afternoon, one person I met with told me hearsay, that he had heard from Dynergy employees that Dynergy had never had any intention of the merger succeeding, that the plan from the start was to get Enron's gas pipelines.
 
Given Enron's suit against Dynergy, I assume this is important to know.  If need be, I can tell you the name of the person who told me this, but I cannot vouch for what they said.

"Employee Meeting","
As you may know by now, the media learned of the employee meeting that was planned for next Wednesday, January 23 at the Hyatt.  To protect the privacy of our employees, we have chosen to cancel the meeting.  As an alternative to the Hyatt, we are looking at space options within our building.  This will require that we hold several, smaller group meetings, but will help to ensure our employees privacy and safety.  We are currently working through logistics and hope to coordinate these meetings rather quickly.  

We are continuing to compile a presentation for the meetings.  It would provide an overview of our current situation, including a timeline of the bankruptcy process and other major challenges we must overcome.  It would further explain the NetCo agreement and its impact on Enron's ongoing business.  And finally, it would outline Enron's organizational structure and strategy going forward.

I will be back in touch soon with further details on the rescheduled meetings.

Subject: More opportunities to place former Enron employees
Importance: High


Cindy,
The silver lining for your former employees is several companies are
interested in Houston relocations or expansions because of your highly
qualified workforce.  Could we get a matrix of the job titles and
quantities of former employees that were recently terminated?  I tried
logging onto the careerservices.enron.com site, but couldn't get access
to resumes.

We have a relocation prospect visiting Houston from NY on Thursday
evening.  They want to talk to a large employer.  I thought this might
be an opportunity for you to present both sides of the equation.  You
are still a significant Houston employer AND you have a significant
number of highly qualified former employees who would be excellent
employees for this organization.  I know this is short notice, but I
just found out.

On another note, on Thursday I spoke with an executive recruiter who had
spoken with 60 former Enron employees that day, and all were already
re-employed.  Thought you could use a bit of good news.

Thanks Cindy!

"","Mr. Lay,

In light of your announcement I would like to make a $1000.00 personal donation, I will go on line to do this this morning . Also I was wondering if there was something I could personally such as going to NY in person to aid in the physical recovery process or lend my logistical professional expertise to help organize things. If this is possible, will the company support and excuse me for a period of time to lend this kind of support? I just feel like I need to do something significantly more that the money donation though I know that within itself is very important?

"RE: A Personal Thanks","Dr. Lay,

There is something you can do in light of the recent events. Since I went out on Workmans' Compensation, Enron's policy has been to cover the balance of my salary over the compensation  payment. This money has been critical in keeping our lives and home together. With three more surgeries and a minimum 7-8 months (best case) before I will be rehabilitated and able to return to work, under whatever circumstance, the continuance of my current agreement is critically important to us. 
My concern is that if, or when, EES ceases to exist, before, or after, the Dynergy transaction, that my status may alter in a way that has devastating consequences in an already stress filled situation. My wife is desperate for some assurance, that we will be able to maintain our household until I can fully function @ work again. Is there some way you can help us in this matter? There seems to be quite a bit of confusion regarding what will happen to us.
Thank you.

Joe

Dear Dr. Lay,

On  Friday, September 8, 2000, I was on a business trip in Findlay, Ohio meeting with Marathon Ashland Petroleum Company Inc. We had recently signed a  five year  electric deal in Houston covering their  Illinois pipeline and terminal facilities behind four utlities. I was there at their request to review other opportunities in Illinois and Ohio and present them with small gifts over a celebration dinner with their spouses. On Saturday, September 9, 2000 at approximately 5:30 am I was struck in my car by an eighteen wheeler passing traffic in a no passing zone.
Your kindness in providing my wife and I with your personal jet so that I could transfer from the Toledo trauma facility I was in, to a local hospital in our home state of New Jersey was greatly appreciated. I needed to be with my daughters and family and be fully evaluated for the multiple traumas I suffered. Getting home meant everything to us at the time, and there were no good alternatives before your generous gesture.
Since last year I have had three surgeries and am preparing for cervical spine surgery October 23, 2001, followed by knee surgery and ankle surgery. It has been an immensely stressful time for all of us, but we always come back to your help at our time of need. In addition, Dr. Lay, I cannot say enough about the kindness and care of Mark Harada, my supervisor and friend, who was at my side after the accident and who has been an endless source of support through our difficult times.
Mark Harada has been recognized by Enron for the exceptional individual he is. His potential value to Enron is immeasurable. He is truly the embodiment of what an Enron manager should be. I was saddened to hear his leadership role in EES had been diminished. He is exceptional.
Based on the  surgeries that lay ahead of me, with the accompanying rehabilitation periods, it appears that I will not be returning to EES for several months. That is why I'm writing to you now. This was a long overdue note of thanks.
Lastly, in a conversation with John Boosey, (formerly Enserch), before his death, he asked if I spoke with you, to pass on his regards. John was a mentor to me during my years with Enserch/Ebasco and had been in ill health for some time.
Finally, from my wife, Dr. Gail Holian Pestana and I, thank you again for bringing us home.

Our Best Regards,

Joe and Gail

"Re: SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","Well: You know.... No one expected the World Trade Centre to be destroyed by terrorists either...I think making a statement like ""We do not expect any Enron facilities to be targets"" is foolhardy......anyone with minimal knowledge of the gas pipeline industry would know how vulnerable our facilities are...The words ""heightened security"" are just  some words to placate someone...I believe knowing the security of our facilities...that ""Anyone"" could easily gain acess to ""ANY"" of our facilities......padlocks and chain link fences would not stop anyone who wanted in.... esp. terrorists.....and just turning on the lights at our facilities does little in my mind to ""secure"" anything............. Someone in the security part of our corporation better wake up......I do not believe we are anywhere near prepared for what could happen....Thanks

"2001 Management Conference","
During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

"India Issues -Catching Up","
Dear Dr. Lay:

I am writing this message to you after a few days on the ground in
India. The news from India continues to be grim and I have several
things that I want to discuss with you.

1. The news on the oil and gas front is not good as u probably have
heard by now. There is little chance that BG will get its request for
operatorship approved for various reasons that I can explain. If u like,
we can do the deal on similar terms with another party and close the
same very quickly. I have been contacted by a few people and could
deliver the same to you if there is an interest.

2. On the Dabhol front, I would like to urge that we meet and discuss a
few ideas that I have. I know that you are extremely busy at this time
but maybe next week I could come to Houston and we could find some time
to meet. I know that there might be a difficulty in non-Enron especially
ex-Enron people working this issue when u have a full internal team
already on the job... but I think that it maybe useful and apprpriate to
put those concerns aside and see if a solution could be found using any
and all available resources. There maybe ways that would prevent the
equity from taking a big write off at this time and get everyone moving
towards finding a solution.

In the meantime, there is a strong effort in India along the judicial
enquiry front to use it to derail the arbitration. Our friends there can
help us only if we are on the ground and give them some hope that a
solution is going to be found. The Indian government is not terribly
motivated at this time and if Enron does not creat options, it will not
result in a terribly good result for Enron either financially or from a
PR perspective.

Again, I know that with several issues occupying you at this time, this
may not be the most burning one. However we have had limited success at
a resolution so far and some other alternatives maybe worth considering.
If you permit, I would love to discuss them with you.

"Post Enron employment issues","
Mr. Lay,
 
I hope this note finds you in good health.   I wish you and your family a happy and healthy New Year.
 
I am currently working with a group of former Enron  employees negotiating with several entities to join one of their  organizations to trade various commodities (excluding power and  gas).  A couple of the entities have shown definitive interest in  hiring the group, but our employment at Enron and employment contracts have  created significant issues.  In order for us to continue with the  discussions and the possibility of employment, we have been asked to provide a  letter from Enron representing that we have been released from the obligations  of our various employment contracts, specifically the non-compete  provision.
 
I know you very interested in assisting former  Enron employees in succeeding with their lives and careers.  I would very  much appreciate your personal help and support in this  matter. 
 
I spoke with Rosalee yesterday (January 10th) and  she suggested I email this note to you with the names of the other members of  this group that may have issues with their employment contracts.  The  individuals other than myself are Bryan Burnett, Jeff Ader and Mark  Bernstein.  
 
Timing as always is important, I will follow up  with Rosalee Monday afternoon to determine a time that I can go the office to  pick up the letters.
 
I know you have tremendous demands on your time  during this difficult period, I sincerely appreciate your attention and  support.  As before, if there is anything I can do for you or family,  please do not hesitate to contact me.  
 
Thank you,

"New CERA Study - ""New Realities/New Risks: North American Power & Gas 2020""","Dr. Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman & CEO
Enron Corp.

Dear Dr. Lay:

Powerful new forces are transforming the North American gas and power
industry, bringing considerable volatility and uncertainty to investment
and strategy. Questions relating to prices, security, geopolitics, the
global economy, and environmental concerns are forcing reconsideration
of basic assumptions and plans.

To address these questions and concerns, Cambridge Energy Research
Associates (CERA) announces a timely new multiclient study, ""New
Realities, New Risks: North American Power and Gas 2020.""

In an online interview CERA Senior Director Lawrence J. Makovich
presents a brief overview of major issues to be addressed in the study.
To hear more information about the study, please access the interview on
our website at http://www.cera.com/mc?c=150&p=1044 .

Using CERA's scenario planning methodology, ""New Realities, New Risks""
will present plausible alternate paths to the future of power and gas
markets in North America over the next 20 years. The Study will provide
useful tools for evaluating corporate strategies and investments as well
as an integrated assessment of gas and power market analyses.

The study will address key issues including
*What levels of gas and power prices are sustainable?
*How will the current wave of power plant and gas pipeline
infrastructure development shift North American energy dynamics?
*What opportunities, risks and challenges face those involved in the
industry?
*How will technological developments affect future gas and power
markets?
*Will the role of government expand or contract in the energy industry?
*What will be the cost and value of increased energy security?
*Who will be the winners and losers in each scenario?

For complete details of the study, including deliverables and proposed
study content, please visit our website at
http://www.cera.com/offerings/details/1,1504,CID2299,00.html.

In the traditional CERA format, the study will start with a kick-off
workshop. Exclusively hosted for study participants(*), the kick-off
workshop will take place in early January at a location to be announced.

"2012 Olympics","
Ken,   
 
   With all that has transpired in the last several weeks, I know that you must be incredibly busy; but if you can work it in, John Kelley and I would like to meet with you for about 30-40 minutes to give you an update on two initiatives, listed below, aimed at getting the 2012 Olympics to Houston.
 
1.  Conversion of the Astrodome to a track and field facility.  This has strong support in the track and field community and may be the most important advantage that Houston has over competing cities.  John has a 10-minute video he would like to show you that features some very strong endorsements of the Astrodome track and field facility from some of the most important people in track and field worldwide.  Also, if the Astrodome conversion were made soon enough, there is a very good chance that the 2007 World Championships of Track and Field could be held in Houston.  
 
2.  Transfer of the headquarters of the national governing body for baseball (USA Baseball) to Houston.  This would mean that Houston would be, among other things, the site for tryouts for the U.S. Olympic baseball team.  Having USA Baseball in Houston would naturally strengthen our bid for the Olympics.  A key for getting the governing body to come to Houston would be the raising of about $3M for construction of facilities.  
 
     The deadline for completion of Houston's bid to become home to USA Baseball is the end of September, so we would like to meet with you at your convenience by September 25, if at all possible.  Let me know if that can be arranged.  I can be reached at 713-783-1223 if you want to further discuss scheduling of a meeting.

"Thank You for Your Hard Work","Mr. Lay:
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all the hard work you are trying to do, and continue to try to do, on behalf of those of us who will always be proud to call Enron 'home'.  I joined Enron a short 11 months ago, and moved from the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission to do so, and will likely never regret taking the leap. I have learned so much of value here, have broadened my horizons by orders of magnitude, and worked with so many top quality people, that I cannot help but feel better for the experience.  I have enjoyed professional success and satisfaction beyond my wildest dreams with Enron, and will always carry the confidence of having succeeded amongst the best there are in the business.  I cannot help but feel terrible that so many wish to lay blame where it does not belong, but I can only assume that in times of crisis, laying blame may soothe nerves and provide some comfort.  Know that there are still many at Enron who admire the enormity of what you have done for energy markets in the United States, and have never doubted your integrity.  As I, like many others, inevitably move on in these coming weeks and months, I will leave with mainly good memories, and of course, the regret that such an awesome organism like Enron could not survive forever.  My prayers and thoughts are with you as you work so hard at preserving our core businesses, and again, thank you for giving me the opportunity to have been a part of Enron.  I will always be proud to have worked under your direction and leadership.
 
Best Regards,
 
Andrew Kosnaski

"FW: Man of God","
I just got to the office and wanted to send this on. The Lord gave me some good stuff to read over ya'll this morning. Some was hard to ""hear"" but as is His way, there is ALWAYS His good heart in His messages. ALWAYS a ""Come to me, I love you."" message. 
I need to time to pray over that email but this is still true even after the passages. I hope you are encouraged. Hope you got the tapes I left on Saturday.
I am keeping a ""prayer journal"" which is a little separate from the ""prayer walking"" but I am getting to where I record the impressions during my walks. 
OH MR. LAY, I just know that you are calling on Jesus for wisdom! Your heart must be so heavy. Call out for His people too. A shepherd cares for his sheep. God is going to take many of ""His sheep"" that have been under your care into another ""earthly pasture"" for their care but He is working all things together for good-to them that love Him. Let's pray for more to fall in love with Jesus!

Subject:        Man of God 
Mr. Lay, 
I am back home and about ready to leave for church. It occurred to me while I was driving back home that God knew of this time before the foundations of the world. He knew that you would be the man at the head of this company. You are a man of God and the Lord knew you would turn to Him in time of trouble. 
Think about that. God gave you a shepherd's heart because your employees ""heard"" your voice in the emails you sent during the hard times leading up to this. Your's is a gentle voice. THAT is GOD in you! And a shepherd at that! Oh how blessed you are!
You showed that you don't love money because you did not take the ""golden parachute"" money. Even though you might have hated to give it up ""in your feelings"" but in your heart you obeyed a higher call on your life! 
God is apparently keeping you calm even during the railing accusations that the enemy is hurling against you. Look at how you glorify God. You most likely don't feel that way but that is what the truth is. 
God has me in constant prayer on your behalf, your employees, your wife, and the spouses of the employees, for HIS glory!

"Enron","
Mr. Lay:
I am a former Enron employee.  I used to be proud of Enron.  I believed everything that you and EES management said.  I believe that the Vision and Values that you and other senior executives at Enron preached are not worth the paper they are printed on.  Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence.  I don't believe you respected the rights of so many Enron employees who sacrificed their family time so that the company would succeed.  I don't believe you have any integrity when it comes to fully disclosing Enron's future.  You obviously have not communicated the truth to employees, analysts or anyone else.  Maybe you should look inside yourself to see if you have the excellence now that you demanded from your employees.
 
I would like to see you take ownership of the incredible debacle that has fallen upon Enron.  So many of my friends and colleagues are out of work because of the gross mismanagement that you and others have shown.  I believe the least you could do is go on record and address these people at a time of year that is so special to so many.  Do the right thing and show some of the visions and values that you spoke so highly of not so long ago.  Show the men and women of Enron and Houston what you're all about.

"Legislative update from Chairman Williams","	I wanted to take a few minutes to update you on the Railroad Commission's tremendous success with our budget and the Sunset process during the recent 77th Legislative Session.   As always, I look forward to receiving your comments on the Commission and our activities.

	One of the critical items in the Commission's budget request was technology advancement to provide our employees with the tools to accomplish their tasks.  By securing funding to migrate our Oil and Gas data from our legacy mainframe system to an open systems environment, the Commission will be able to more quickly and efficiently access information and answer inquiries.  The current mainframe system severely limits our employees' ability to use and access oil and gas databases to perform routine job functions.  This project will take four years to complete and will include migration of the current mainframe computer system that consists of 18 major database systems with approximately 300 defined applications made up of 2.5 million lines of code.

	The Sunset review process for the Railroad Commission officially started on August 16, 1999 when the Self Evaluation Report was submitted to the Sunset Commission.  For 21 months the process continued with numerous meetings, field tours, submissions of information, public hearings, and visits with Sunset and legislative staff.  From the very beginning, the Railroad Commission approached the process as an opportunity to demonstrate our great public service and proficiency in the oil and gas regulatory arena.
	This was our opportunity to shine.  And I'm happy to report that we were successful - the Commission was extended an additional 12 years, given additional responsibilities, and provided with increased funding.

ABANDONED OIL AND GAS WELLS
	In the problem area of abandoned oil and gas wells, it was recognized that the Commission has been fighting an uphill battle.  Legislative changes in 1991 had weakened the Commission's ability to require adequate financial assurance for oil & gas operators.  That has been corrected.  Beginning on September 1, 2001 the price of alternatives to bonding has been increased.  While the ""Good Guy"" un-bonded option has been continued, the annual fee has been raised from $100 to $1000.  While the percentage of bond option has been continued, the percentage has increased from 3% to 12-? %.  In addition, a higher bonding requirement will be established for all bay and offshore wells. After a three-year transition period, both of the un-bonded options will be eliminated on September 1, 2004.  At that time, all oil & gas operators must be bonded
	Another problem with abandoned wells has been the practice of transferring shut-in or minimal producing wells to marginal operators, who may salvage the wells and then leave them for the state to plug and cleanup.  That has been corrected.  During the transition period to universal bonding, no well can be transferred to a new operator unless the new operator has a blanket bond or the individual wells are bonded.

OIL FIELD CLEAN UP FUND
	While the above actions should substantially slow the growth of abandoned wells, a huge backlog of wells and sites still need to be plugged or cleaned up.  This has also been addressed.  Statute changes have been implemented to allow the Commission to place a lien on any abandoned well faster to avoid theft of salvageable equipment.  More importantly, there was the recognition that the revenues to the Oil Field Cleanup Fund need to be increased.  Under current fee structures, revenues to the fund would be about $12 million per year; with the newly authorized fees, revenues to the fund should approach $20 million per year, a 67% increase.  The revenue increase comes from increased drilling and other permit fees, from an increase in the production fee on oil and gas, and a new fee that must be remitted with each P-5 renewal.  These increased revenues will be used to accelerate our plugging and site remediation activities.

SITE CLEANUP
	The Sunset bill authorizes a more extensive voluntary cleanup program.  This includes giving the Commission authority to grant releases of liability to parties who enter into agreements to cleanup sites that are not their responsibility.  Hopefully, this will encourage more sites to be cleaned-up without using state funds.  Additionally, the statute now specifically recognizes that risk assessment standards will be applicable to determine the extent of a cleanup project.  The Commission's development of these risk-based standards is progressing and should be proposed in rule form shortly.

PIPELINE SAFETY
	The Commission's initiative to require integrity testing of pipelines was affirmed and strengthened through new statutes.  The legislature gave the Commission authority to require public notice of major new pipeline construction projects.  Hazardous liquid pipelines that are within 1000 feet of a school must prepare and present to the school board an emergency action plan for the school.  Testing of natural gas piping in schools was extended to include private schools, and testing of piping in LP-Gas fueled schools, both private and public, will be instituted beginning with the 2002-03 school year.

GAS UTILITIES
	In the gas utility area, the Commission's authority was significantly expanded to allow cities to cede their original jurisdiction over gas utility rates to the Commission.   Utilities were granted the option to provide electronic billing via the Internet.  Contested cases involving gas utility rates can now be heard at the State Office of Administrative Hearings, but the Commission retains final authority on the decision order.

	The Sunset bill did not significantly affect most other divisions within the Commission.  An attempt to require the Surface Mining Division to locate and identify all pits and quarries in the state without additional resources was successfully defeated.  In recognition of their quality training products, AFRED is now permitted to enter into agreements to sell these products to other states.

	In summary, both the budget request and Sunset review resulted in positive steps forward for the Commission.  I am convinced that the Commission emerged as a stronger, more efficient, and better-recognized agency as a result of the 77th Legislative Session.

"Next Steps on Wind sale","Ken--

We understand that you may be heading to an auction of the wind business.
We would like to speak to you about this strategy.  An auction seems to us
to be unnecessarily costly and inefficient. We stand ready, willing, and
able to negotiate a purchase with you, and don't believe that a lengthy and
cumbersome auction process will serve anyone's best interests.

We have a key meeting on December 20 with those interested in putting the
financing together with us for this deal.  Appreciating the demands on your
time, is there any way that we could get on your schedule for even 15
minutes some time prior to the 20th?  We are ready to hop on a plane and
come to you at a moment's notice.  Let me know if you think this can work.

Many thanks,
Katie McGinty

to the tv while we carry on our daily activities in Columbia.  Actually I  
told John I hope they don't call in the WWII Submariners for active duty or  
he is in trouble. Actually there are very few of them left and I doubt this

We have had several calls this morning to inquire if we are o.k. Yes we are  
fine, except devastated about what is happening to the Country. 
On a routine note, we have painters painting our garage, workers putting on  
new siding at our rental house across the street, A furnace man putting in a  
new energy efficient furnace also in the rental house. Most of these workers  
are in good spirits..some mostly unaware of what is going on.  The furnace  
man thought the answer to our problems was that everybody should carry more  
guns. Life goes on at many different levels.

Dear Ken:

I of course still keep very close watch of how Enron is doing.  I am very
sad to see the problems you are facing today particularly since you were
really looking forward to slowing down a bit and spending more time with
your family.

I sincerely appreciate the kindness you showed me while at Enron and the
continued assistance and blessings you have sent my way since leaving Enron.
I will never forget what you have done for me.

Please, if there is any way that I can help you please let me know.  I am
willing to help you in any way you see fit.  When you have a moment of time
I would like to sit down with you and talk to you about some of the areas
that I beleive Enron lost its way and would like to see where you think I
could help you re-establish your vision for Enron.

Please do not consider this note simply kind words.  I sincerely want and
believe that I can help.


Best regards,

Sean

"Turkish industrialist Nuri Coalkoglu","
Ken

I understand a Turkish industrialist named Nuri ?olakoglu has been in contact with you through Bill Miller and possibly Jerry Giest.  Colakoglu is an extremely wealthy and well regarded Turkish industrialist who has aggressively expanded into the Turkish energy sector.

We have had a number of meetings with Colakoglu over the years and although we appreciate his potential prospects for the future we do not see a win-win opporutnity with his organization at this time.  We expect he may try and contact you so wanted to let you know in advnace the background on his proposal.

Colakoglu has proposed that, in order to manage our Trakya payment issue, Enron utilize the Arcos turbines to build, on balance sheet, a 1200 MW power plant at the tailgate of his recently completed specualtive LNG regas facility in Turkey.  The plant would be part of a comprehensive proposal to the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce the prices at Trakya, in exchange for an agreement by TETTA? (the new Turkish power trading company resulting from the split up of TEA?, the former electricity monopoly) to purchase power from the new facility. All three plants would be fuelled by LNG provided by Enron and tolled through the Colakoglu's regas facility. 

In essence, Nuri wants us to build a power station as soon as possible to use the capacity at his LNG terminal which is now idle and has the potential to be a white elephant.

Our team has explained to Colakoglu  that they thought the fact that the proposal relied totally on TETTA?'s credit was fatal, but that they would discuss it with EEL management. 

Lloyd Wantschek has responded to Colakoglu in the attached letter (we have highlighted the relevant portion for your information).

"Ken's SEC Testimony","Dear Fam,

Sally informed me today that John Brindle, a former head of Enron security,
is now involved and will be handling all airline reservations (through
Gordon Bethune at Continental airlines), ground transportation and hotel
reservations (Four Seasons or Park Hyatt) for us.  He has suggested that we
use ""assumed"" names for all reservations being made.  John feels strongly
that there could be a risk and a small unit will attract less attention and
be easier to maneuver,  also it will allow for less media coverage...which
is a good thing. Apparently, he will be giving a detailed report to Rosalee
on Friday of this week.

I talked with Ken about it tonight and as much as we would love to have you
there for moral support we do not want to do anything that would put you in
harm's way or create a media spectacle for him.  So, unfortunately, the
prudent thing to do is have you stay in Houston and pray for him in your
safe environments.

For your information, our plan is to go up to DC on Thursday, January 31 and
back on Tuesday morning, February 5.  Ken gives his testimony at the SEC
hearings on Monday morning, February 4, and I am told that it will go on
until late in the day.  These hearings are on TV and transcripts can be read
on the internet.  I will try and get all of that info to you prior to 2/4.

The following is also from Sally:

""John has asked if the kids would have an interest in meeting with him for
20-30 minutes to hear his suggestions for ways in which to best help the
situation, and ideas on keeping their families safe on a daily basis?  I
expect this would need to be done during the weekday.  I would also suggest
it be held maybe at the ROCC 12th floor conference rm. or at the Huntingdon
and for the kids and spouses only, no children as it would only distract
from his limited time.  Then, if anyone feels the need to interact with him
on a more detailed basis they could arrange it with him, at their expense.
He did express concerns that due to KLL's high profile, kidnapping is not
out of the realm of possibility but he has numerous suggestions for
circumventing this.""

Let us know your thoughts.  Love, Mom/Linda

"HOUSTON ROCKETS TICKETS","Dear Family,

Please see the attached schedules for preseason and regular games for the
Houston Rockets through November.  Because we all have very busy lives and
find it impossible to confirm too far in advance, I will wait closer to each
game before distributing tickets.  Also, Ken's schedule is a moving target
and it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one game
this year, if we could do it on shorter notice.  Our eight basketball seats
are amazing and the tickets are a hot item, so hopefully everyone will try
to make this work and have fun doing it.

I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets.
If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitely
want to attend, please advise me and I will put your name on the list with
an * next to it.  Additionally, if you think you know your schedule and
would like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games, I
will put your name on the list with a ? next to your name.  Once your name
is on the list and as each game gets closer, I would appreciate it if you
would contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend.
Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate, so that each family
member has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets.
Hopefully, we can all work it out.  However, in the event that we have more
requests than tickets for the same game, and we are unable to settle it, I
will have Barb pull names out of a hat.  Once you confirm your attendance,
tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down to
the doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up.

For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets,
they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order.  I
will have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation.
If you have other family members or someone special that you would like to
offer tickets to, let me know.  I can either contact you and have you
contact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barb
will contact them directly, as you wish.

In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached, please contact Barb
as she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to the
tickets.  GO ROCKETS!

Love, Mom/Linda

"A mail from an Intern","
Sir,
 
Before I start, let me introduce myself.  My name is Thirumalesh Aedunuthula.  I had the pleasure of interning with Enron, this summer.  I am a MBA student at Louisiana State University and worked with Enron Tax department.
 
Over the past few weeks, things have changed for Enron at a faster pace than expected/imagined.  To some, it is amazing how stock fell from $90 to 26 cents just in a year.  People have been attributing lot of things for the fall, from California crises to international deals, without actually taking time to find out what went wrong with Enron .
 
As an intern, I had the opportunity to feel the work culture of Enron.  I felt that Enron is making profits not because it is in Energy Industry but because of energetic people like you and Mr.. Jeff Skilling and many others. I strongly believe that greatest asset with Enron is its talent pool, which made the company what it is today.
Today, we have a discussion on Enron's Crisis in class.  I know, for sure, that many would be interested in voicing their opinion against Enron.  I would go to class and take the side of Enron.  I might be in minority.  But that doesn't matter, as to understand what Enron is, one has to really experience it.
 
Hoping that Enron will really climb back, much faster than its fall....
 
Yours Truly,

"Thank you for a great experience","Dear Ken,

Today I learned that effective midnight tonight I have been made redundant from my position in Enron Europe. I have worked for Enron for the last 10 years and I can say that despite what has happened today, joining Enron was the best career move I made. The past 10 years have presented opportunities that were beyond my wildest dreams. I appreciate everything that Enron has done for myself and my family, and I leave believing that I did my best to return my gratefulness in some way. While growing up in a worling class environment my father taught me two great lessons in life, which I believe we all need to learn. The first being that if you ever want anything in life then you had better work for it. The second being that you should never understand the meaning of the word ""can't"". I believe that I have been able to follow his teaching in my career with Enron.

I leave Enron with tremendous experience and, most of all a feeling of belonging to something that was once great. I truly believed in the company and its people. Indeed I have reminded myself daily over the last few weeks that Enrons success was built more on its intangible assets rather than its tangible assets. Enron's greatness was built by its people because we all have dreams and ambitions to be a part of something great. Although I leave the company with great sadness I also leave with a great feeling of thanks and appreciation.

"Computer Virus","
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

Current position:

We have paid them all of the margin  they have contractual rights for - $33.5mm gone out today which is margin under our financial gas contract.
However, they want full collateral on all of their power position (this is being driven by Bill Reid on their power floor -ex Enron employee), the amount is another $220mm (they have no collateral rights to this). 

Essentially, the credit guy (Frank Hilton) is hurting us in the market and anything you can do to help is appreciated.  I believe some of this is vindictive behaviour from an ex-employee and senior management may not know what he is up to.

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

10/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. 
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. 
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. 
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of ""what it does for local reliability."" 
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing.

I feel you are a victim of things that have gone on as are some of the rest of us.  I have enjoyed very much working for Enron and had planned on this being where I continued my employment, it is a terrific place to work.  I've been looking at positions outside of Enron though.

"Reuters story on Dynegy 3Q earnings","We'll get pointed questions related to Europe and broadband thanks to Steve Bergstrom.  Suggest we answer that we feel confident that the first mover advantage will give us superior returns in the long run.

USA: INTERVIEW-Dynegy feels gradual approach in Europe vindicated.
By Andrew Kelly

10/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Natural gas and power marketer Dynegy Inc. said on Monday it felt vindicated in its step-by-step approach to building a business in Europe in view of recent retrenchments by rival Houston-based companies. 
Dynegy recently opened an office in Madrid to market natural gas, electricity and derivatives. Spain is the fifth country in continental Europe where Dynegy has set up an office since it started up its European operations in Britain in 1994.
By contrast Enron Corp. has recently announced plans to cut staffing at its European operations by 5 percent to 10 percent amid concerns about slow and piecemeal progress toward deregulation of European natural gas and electricity markets. 
""Enron threw 800 bodies at it and tried to do it in a hurry. We've been going at it much more slowly because we thought it would take some time,"" Dynegy President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Bergstrom told Reuters in an interview. 
Another Dynegy rival, Reliant Resources Inc., said last month it was considering a possible sale of its electricity generation business in the Netherlands. 
""Reliant bought one utility in one country and realized that's not really the way to enter the market in Europe,"" Bergstrom said of the move which cost Reliant $2.4 billion. 
Bergstrom said his own company differed with Enron and Reliant in the execution of its entry into the European market, rather than in its assessment of the market's potential. 
""We've gone at this much more cautiously. We've made sure that we staff it appropriately for the market timing and we think we've done it the right way,"" he said. 
Bergstrom said there were similar differences between Dynegy and Enron's approach to the broadband telecommunications market where Enron has also cut jobs after admitting that it probably overestimated the market's short-term potential. 
""They're having to retrench, but you're not hearing them give up on the telecommunications business. Our cost structure is so much less than theirs, that's why we're a lot more optimistic, because they have to go through cutting a bunch of costs whereas we never added those costs,"" he said. 
Dynegy reported on Monday its third-quarter net earnings rose 62 percent as its wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. 
Dynegy has said it expects its broadband business, created late last year, to generate a positive net income next year. The business posted a $15 million loss in the third quarter of 2001. 
Dynegy's Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson told analysts in a conference call on Monday that the unit's revenues had doubled in the latest quarter to $8 million. 
""We believe the industry touched the bottom in this communications market in the third quarter, with bandwidth demand picking up sharply in the foreseeable future,"" Watson said.

"Update for Wednesday/Thursday?","Hello Ken

As we have not had a recent ""daily update"" from you - I write inquiring about the status of OUR company.

We heard about the acquisition discussions with Dynegy through the press (NOT from Enron's management!).  Clearly, this does not engender confidence in the management's communication philosophy.

We also heard that there is a meeting planned with Enron's banks on Friday - again through the press!  Communication failed again.

Further reductions in confidence came as Enron restated it's financial statements for the period 1997 through 2000.  Again this news was provided by the press!

Couple of questions for you - who were the commercial folks putting together the LJM, Chewco etc. deals?  Who were senior managers approving these deals?  Perhaps Enron should part company with some of those folks too.  

Where was the board and where were you when these deals were being done?  There appears to have been no corporate governance at the relevant periods!

On a personal level, I have invested many years in this company.  I currently have a holding of approx. 4,500 shares which I purchased because I believed in the company.  I also have numerous share options.  

Unfortunately, this episode has obliterated my confidence in management and in particular in you and Jeff Skilling.  I suspect you guys are ok - as you had the foresight (knowledge?) to cash out your holding during the latter part of last year and most of this year.

Please be aware that the fate of thousands of people rests in your hands.

I would be interested to hear your views.

"REDUNDANCY","

In some areas of ENE 2 people are doing the work 1/2 person could do. Is this magnified throughout ENE as numerous people in other departments have claimed? Shouldn't we be reassessing our manpower needs  on a broader basis to cover the real needs? This would result in a reduction of manpower, but employees without real jobs to do have low moral which adversely impacts the whole company.  The ultimate result would be a stronger company both financially & professionally.

"Our Values","Mr. Lay,

Even though this will in all probability never even be read, I would still like you to know I am proud to have at least been part of Enron. I am a foreigner and came to work for you a year ago exactly. I can clearly remember how all I knew here said how lucky a <beep> I was to work for the most safe and good company in all of Texas and probably way beyond it. I am from the Netherlands and what I call 'imaging', was unknown to me. Still, here I am, now fully cooperating by being very proud to work for my company, Enron. 

These are trying times for all of us. It is hard to even smile back at people that make cheerful little jokes about the situation we are in. When something negative is being said, I'll be there jumping the barricades defending what I know Enron to be. Unfortunately, in the wee hours when there is nothing left to fight and all you can do is wonder about what the heck is going on, I become upset. Upset with myself for defending Enron while I have no idea what I am talking about. All we all know is what we read online, see on the news and read in the paper. Usually people outside know more than we right here at that, according to your emails, powerful pumping and beating heart committed to get us out of the predicament we are in. 

Now, I ask you, is there anyway you can give us a little more of that Enron feeling? We all know that we have to prepare for the worst, but nobody knows anything so to say. Even if we stay loyal and try and not update that resume and not look for jobs, we don't know what is the least that we can expect at the end of the day. Sure, it must be possible for us to go and find out online what the little rules are and guess what we can expect. Instead how about doing that 'imaging' again. Us being proud that even if we end up being let go, that we were informed and knew what was coming. Bestow on us that what you gave us the first day we came in: Our Values.

With kind regards,

"Options","Mr. Lay:

First, I want to say that I've been a dedicated employee of Enron for 9 years now and, looking back over that time, it's been the greatest period of my life, career-wise.  When I first went to work for Enron, I was almost starry eyed.  I was working for the home town team and it was just the greatest company I had ever been associated with.  I started out with Enron Power Corp. and the energy and focus within that group was just incredible.

I've seen a lot of change over the past 9 years.  Some great, some good and some not so good.  But all in all, I would do it all over again in a heart beat, because I still trust in the core of this company and decisions our management have made.  But most of all, we've still got great people.  Based on the current events of the past 3 to 6 months, it does indeed look like we are going to have to ""do it all over again"".  However, I am an eternal optimist.  Looking at this in football terms...  this is a rebuilding year and we've got a bright future with a young team and a deep bench.

One thing I always hung my hat on was the integrity that both you and Rich Kinder exuded.  I was saddened to see Mr. Kinder move on, but I was confident that having you remain behind would continue our successes.  And we have been successful.  Aside from the LJM issue (which, to be honest, I still don't fully understand), I think we've just had some external distractions that have hampered our stock growth this year, such as Dabhol, Portland General, California, etc., in addition to the market conditions in general.  

In the all-employee meeting, you told the troops that it was going to take the continued dedication and hard work from all of us to get things going in the right direction in order for us to dig out from this mess.  I am fully prepared to do this, however, there is one request I would like to bring up.  I know I am not the only person out there who has options that are going to expire at the end of this year.  In all my wildest dreams (or nightmares), I would have never envisioned the stock getting low enough to threaten a grant price of $21.563, but here we are.  As a dedicated and confident employee, I hung in there early in the year and listened to all indications around me that the stock would go to 100.  Later in the year, as the stock moved downward, I heard indications that we were going to bounce back strong.  I was on board.  I was excited.  I trusted that this was the case.  In fact, I look back on this past year and, based on what I knew at the time, I would probably do the same thing over again.

But...   that was then and this is now.  It has been painful for me, as I know it has been for you and all others with a stake in this company.  I want to get us back to our heyday and am willing to commit to that end.  

My request is simple...    is there any way possible to extend options expiring at the end of this year by one year?

If you want to make a good faith gesture towards long-time employees who are willing to re-dedicate themselves to the daunting task at hand, I can think of nothing better for the short term.   I think extending the expiration date on options would go a long way towards healing an Enron employee population who need some good news in the midst of this situation we find ourselves in.  

If you can't do anything, I will understand.  I know your office has always had an open door policy with respect to e-mail feedback, but this is the first one I've ever written.  I always contend that it never hurts to ask in a situation like this.

Mark

I do not know who is left in EES or Corporate HR to send this to.

I was severed Oct 5 and have two severance payments due on 31 Dec and 31 Jan.
 Will Enron pay these?  Since I signed a waiver not to sue Enron, can I
participate in the bankruptcy proceedings if Enron does not pay?  Also, there
are  quite a few previously severed employees who have questions, would you
add information to the website regarding our status regarding payments etc.

"Does capitalism have a conscience?","I heard your decision on channel 13 this morning as I was dressing for work. I was not moved by your gesture to give your contractual monetary provisions back to the company who would be Dynegy when this is all said and done. If you are sincere about wanting to help Enron, then helping the people who have made Enron what it is today would be a  more appropriate gesture. Clearly you know that Dynegy's employees will be given higher consideration for jobs than Enron employees will. The company will be dismantled and so will our lives.

The road to Enron was not an easy one, and  my  decision to seek employment here was difficult in light of the way Enron is portrayed in the back offices of the energy industry.  Enron is said to be a sweatshop, a backstabbing work environment and that the executive levels of management at Enron fuel, foster and support this type of mentality. I have worked in various commercial capacities, and I came to Enron with the hope  that times had changed, and  that the thriving energy industry had taken Enron to another stratosphere, and I was right! I love my job because the work environment is conducive to a mature and intelligent exchange of information and growth potential. 

Just when you believe you are among the most intelligent, there is always someone who comes along with more real world application, with common sense and integrity added. Hiring intelligent people is a great practice, but I've worked with the best and the brightest in many companies so Enron is no exception. Hiring the best and the brightest obviously was the downside to Enron's demise. It appears  that there is a thin line between intelligence and arrogance and Enron appears to have stepped over that line.  

Due to what you called ""mistakes in judgement'"", my future here is uncertain, as is that of my my co-workers. Many are agonizing about their families futures as well. I have survived a corporate merger, bankruptcy and buyouts with a number of companies specifically, Texaco, Columbia Energy Group and Amoco.  During all of this I continued to hold my head high and to provide the same level of service during these transitions, so that at the end of the day my self esteem and integrity would be intact. 

Yes, we can and will all find other jobs, just as the many other recently unemployed people in this hurting economy will.  Everyone speaks to the loss of investor confidence, class action lawsuits and corporate losses, but who speaks out for the employees affected by the actions of a few. We were robbed of our hope, and the expectation of doing a good job and reaping the benefits. The investors and the employees here were kept in the dark, and  the powers that be have just sold us down the river and for what? For a handful of people to get richer. 

Rationalizing and trying to bargain the behavior of those who are at fault for this catastrophe is just wrong. Taking it to a level where you somehow convince yourself that everything that has happened to date is okay, is just wrong. Companies merge, are bought out and collapse every day due to mismanagement, industry nose dives and economic slow downs. But please tell me how a company in just a few weeks, can go from a powerhouse to a beggar on the streets of downtown Houston?


Truthfully,

Not just merely a whiner, but a long suffering Gas Industry Specialist.

Subject: Myths Surrounding Enron
Dear Family,
 
Obviously, everybody has been inundated with  frustrating, erroneous media stories since what seems like the very beginning of  this nightmare.  My mother-in-law, Sally Pate, called me yesterday and told  me she has been listening to Rush Limbaugh everyday on the internet from 11 a.m.  to 2 p.m. (cst).  Quite honestly, I haven't thought about our good ole'  friend Rush since our incredible ""NYC FAMILY TRIP"" when we got to see him in  action--live.  So yesterday, I tuned in to see what he had to say about the  current state of Enron and its impact on the U.S. financial and political  arenas.  Incredibly, the experience was refreshing because it was nice to  hear someone reporting the facts as well as disproving a lot of theories and  statements which the media and politicians have been wrongly voicing.  His  underlying message:  it's the media's job to report the news (the good, the  bad, and the ugly), but it's their responsibility to report the facts and not  gossip.  Therefore, we as a society can accurately form opinions based  on truth, not lies.   
 
I've attached the following web site page which  highlights some of Rush's comments.
 
Love,
 
David.
 
 
P.S.  KEN, I LOVE YOU AND PRAY FOR YOU  EVERYDAY.  GO KEN GO!

"","Dear Ken,

Several weeks ago I sent you an email regarding the amount of money you
owe me as a result of Enron's demise.  Thus far you have not responded.

Based on today's closing stock price for Enron, the current amount you
owe me and my family is now $1,171,968.00 which must be replaced in my
401K . This money you so callously destroyed was intended to pay for my
children's education and provide a retirement fund for my wife and me.
I worked for Enron for almost 19 years and I earned every bit of this
retirement.  Have you ever lived in Midland Texas where the dust blows
so thick you cannot see or breathe?  I experienced these conditions
often when I lived there while I worked for Enron.  Have you ever lived
in Minnesota and cleared snow drifts 6 feet high when the wind chill was
100 degrees below zero so you could get your children to school?  I did
many times when I lived there and worked for Enron. I could give you
more examples but I do not want to bore you.

If you have a shred of honesty or an ounce of decency left in your
miserable skin, you will refund this money to me.

Sincerely,

Neal F. Shaw

Psalms 9:10   ""Those who know your name will trust in you, for you, LORD, have never forsaken those who seek you. "" 
Thank you, Lord, that Mr. Lay is one that knows your name. Help him, Lord, that even though things look absolutely awful, we look to you for you are our help. You are an ever present help in time of trouble. All that call upon the name of the Lord will be saved. We will not tell you how our salvation should look, we will just trust in the One that can save us. We trust in your gentle, loving kindness. Your heart that has good thoughts towards us that we may have an expected end. Lord, the end looks like disaster right now. Oh Lord, hear our cry for your name's sake. Deliver us and we will proclaim your goodness to all. Don't leave us to the hands of our enemies. Thank you, Lord, that we see that we CANNOT trust in money or earthly riches and forgive us that we have momentarily sinned but Yes, Lord, we see that we can ONLY trust in you. Great is your faithfulness! 
Lord, thank you. Thank you that you hear the cry of your people. That is the cry you search for on the earth! You say that you will save us, Lord. Oh help us, Lord Jesus. Even when we fear, we will trust in you. 
In Jesus name......

Path to greatness
+++++++++++++++++++

The challenges come, and you rise with determination to meet
those challenges. The result is that after the challenge passes,
you're better off than you were before.

A successful life is composed of a series of ever-increasing
challenges. Sustained achievement comes from stringing one challenge
after another, and then doing whatever it takes to transcend those
challenges.

Challenge forces you to raise your expectations. Challenge compels
you to put in extra effort. Challenge encourages you to learn more,
to become more effective, to be more focused and committed.

The challenges seem uncomfortable and unwelcome at first. Yet when
you eventually are able to look back on them, you'll clearly see
that each one makes you stronger and more capable.

What challenges do you face today? Imagine the best places they
can take you, and then make the effort necessary to get there.
Your challenges create your very own special path to greatness.

We regret that Fred Malek has decided to not pursue talks with you and
Paul Portney about the RFF Board.  Thanks, though, for trying.  When the
Nominating Committee met back in October, they also thought that Steve
Rales and Frank Pearl would be good candidates.  Would you be willing to
try to set up a meeting with one or both of them now?  Also, Paul and I
will be in Atlanta on Jan 3-4 and would have time to meet with Walter
Massey if he was available.  Please let me know how you'd like to

"By-law Change","Gentlemen:

There was a discussion at the Executive Committee meeting last week
regarding a bylaw change.  Eliminate existing Bylaw 9 and change it to read
that ""Members will retain Graduate status for only as long a period as they
held Active membership or until normal council retirement at age 72,
whichever occurs first.""

The following members would be immediately affected by the proposed change
and would leave the council:  Sam Armacost, Percy Barnevik, Art Blank,
Michael Bonsignore, Ed Budd, Ed Carpenter, David Coulter, Walter Forbes, Jim
Johnson, Tim Koogle, Jack Krol, Paul Lego, Jan Leschly, Dick McCormick,
Eckhard Pfeiffer, Rick Scott, Pete Silas, Jeff Skilling, Bob Stempel, Rick
Thoman, John Walter, Dennis Weatherstone and Bob Winters.

The mandatory retirement provision affects an additional 49 members.  In
summary, we currently have 115 Active members and would be reducing the
Graduate members from 149 to 77.  Frankly, a more dramatic change than I
thought.  Any thoughts?

"Request For Assistance","Mr. Lay:

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping to strengthen a relationship EES has with Sysco Corporation.  

EES and Sysco began discussing a wide array of business opportunities with one another in the Fall of last year. On June 30th of this year, we entered into a 10 year electricity supply contract for all of Sysco's California facilities.  We are currently pursuing two important Q4 transactions with Sysco; an electricity supply contract for their Texas facilities and a demand side management contract for all of their facilities.

We had planned to close the Texas supply transaction today.  However, in a phone conversation I had this morning with Sysco's Director of Procurement, Terry Taylor I was informed that Sysco's CEO, Charles Cotros has instructed Mr. Taylor not to enter into any further transactions with us ""until Enron's financial picture clears up"".  Mr. Taylor believes that Mr. Cotros' concerns about Enron would be diminished if he received a call from a senior executive at Enron. 

Rosalee indicated that you and Mr. Cotros serve together on the Board of Directors for the Greater Houston Partnership. Would you please call Mr. Cotros and attempt to assuage his concerns about our financial condition.  Mr. Cotros is out of the office until Thursday, November 1st.  His direct phone number is (281) 584-1415.  His assistant is Andrea Walters and her phone number is (281) 584-1405.   Mr. Cotros' biography is as follows:   

Charles H. Cotros, age 64, has served as a director of SYSCO since 1985.  Mr. Cotros has served as Chairman of the Board since July 2000 and as Chief Executive Officer since January 2000.  He served as Chief Operating Officer from 1995 until January 2000 and as President from 1999 until July 2000.  He has been employed by SYSCO since 1974.  Mr. Cotros is Chairman of the Executive Committee and he is also a member of the Finance Committee.   Source: Proxy, 9/24/01

Thank you in advance for your consideration and anticipated assistance.  Otherwise, please let me know if you will not be able take the action requested and I will initiate an alternative plan.

Respectfully,

Craig Sutter

Subject:	Text for Enron wide email

Steve - below are the initial measures we believe we can take starting Wednesday.  The problem is guard force manpower.  The increased demands are so great now that the current force is working two 12 hour shifts instead of three 8 hour shifts.  We will be putting in a request for more guards in the next couple of days, but it takes 3 weeks for them to be hired and trained by the contractor.

Please feel free to edit the text as you see fit.  Also - would you like the email to come from you, the Office of the Chairman, or business controls? 

Text of Message:

Due to recent events, Enron will be increasing security at its facilities around the world.  As part of this increased security effort, beginning Wednesday morning, September 26, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Building in Houston and, where applicable, at other Enron facilities:

	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Building, a guard will match the photo on 	the badge to the bearer.

	All employees will be required to display their badges while in any Enron facility.  The badge must be attached to 	the front of the employee at some point between the waist and the shoulders.

	Employees who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Building (U.S. 	driver's	 license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

	Visitors to the Enron Building must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must 	completely fill out the visitor card.  Visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, 	or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Building.

	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

	Visitors to the Enron Building will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a 	visitor's log at 	the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  	At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged 	contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the 	escorting employee or badged contractor.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees.

"... we definitely made some very bad investments ...","Ken and Greg

I am part of the Enron Tax Department, assigned currently to Enron Global Assets, previously to Enron India.  Your comment regarding the very bad investments Enron made in international assets is absolutely true.  Perhaps the assets themselves are not all that bad, Enron just over-paid, over-built or over-leveraged.  In some cases, I suspect we did all three!  

But that's not the point of this message.

When you make statements like you did in yesterday's Investor conference call it erodes EGA's ability to sell those assets (who wants to buy a very bad investment ?) and chokes the spirit of the employees who have remained loyal to Enron and continue to support the needs of EGA.  The 100 or so members in the EGA support group did not make the bad decisions.  Those were made by former and current executives, RAC, Enron's Board of Directors, and others who were well-qualified to make such decisions.  I cannot begin to tell you how hard Tax, Legal, Accounting, PR, etc. worked to make the best of what often-times looked to us to be a stupid if not bad investment.  

Many of those who remain have devoted several years to Enron's international experiment.  We've given up dinner with our families, weekend soccer games and campouts, in many cases we have even sacrificed our good health.  I suspect we will continue to make those sacrifices in order to close asset sales and efficiently return to Enron the remaining value.

Please, when you proclaim to the World the very bad investments Enron made, take some time to remind those of us who are left to unwind these investments that Enron is fortunate to have some very bright and dedicated employees diligently working to contain the damage already done.

Sincerely,

Mike Norris

After numerous efforts to secure an audience with President Fox, we have
been successful in scheduling a lunch with him on the 27th of June.  In
addition to our usual reasons for taking this very important one-day
trip, I have been advised by Presidencia (equivalent for our ""West
Wing"") that during this face-to-face meeting, we would have the
appropriate opportunity to invite President Fox to visit Houston.  I
have just received written confirmation of the 2:30 p.m. luncheon
meeting.  I will be going to appropriate GHP Boardmembers and major
investors to determine who would be available to participate.   I wanted
to give my leadership heads up and request any thoughts or ideas that
you may have on this subject matter as well as to determine your
availability.

"Meeting with State Dept. re Dabhol","
	Jim
	I met yesterday with  Alan Larson's staff at State to bring them up to date on where we are and urge further efforts by State Dept to get the Prime Minkister's office to engage in meaningful negotiations on Dabhol.  State at this point remains fully sympathetic to the position we are in and recognizes that a closer U.S.-Indian relationship long term must be built on a sound commercial relationship, which cannot exist so long as Dabhol remains unaddressed and unresolved.  To that end their word is that the commercial dialogue continues and continues as a priority.  Larson, Undersecretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, has been appointed USG Coordinator of the bilateral commercial relationship and a trip planned in November to go to India remains on at the behest of the Ambassador.   This could certainly change with the Afghan situation but this is the situation as of now.
	The Ambassador is a critical player for us in terms of his daily interaction with Mishra and other senior Indian govt. officals.  We need to keep him up to speed and view him as a critical resource to pressure the PMO.  Particularly at this juncture, when India is working hard to make sure they are perceived by the USG to be at least as supportive as Pakistan to the US, a word from the Ambassador to the PM to get Dabhol off the table would be jolting. I would encourage Wade to try to meet with him and send the message that he has to step up the pressure to get the Indian side to seriously negotiate.  thanks John

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Ken-
As you may remember from Aspen this July I am now  Chairman of CHI Energy a subsidiary of ENEL of Italy.  (CHI is a much  smaller operation than Destec Energy but we are growing fast and I am having fun  with renewables.)  ENEL has an interest in acquiring Enron Wind and Wessex  Water.  The CFO of ENEL is in New York wednesday evening thru thursday of  this week and would like to speak with whoever you think would be appropriate  about our interest.  The CFO's name is Fulvio Conti and his phone number in  Italy is 011 39 329 6130 692 or 011 39 335 287 981.  I am currently at my  home in the Caribbean but can be reached at megawatt@starband.net  email address or  at my phone here which is 011 501 26 4101.  The ENEL may turn out to be  broader than the wind and water.  Please let Fulvio or myself know the best  way to proceed.

"RE: To Chuy's defenders","
Now, Jack, take it easy on poor OfficeName1234!  Even the state legislature agreed to reduce penalties for people of diminished mental capacity.  Surely this is a case requiring our deepest sympathy, not our anger.  As a victim of our public education system, OfficeName1234 may not be able to spell out his/her/it's (in fairness to transitionals) full name.  And, truthfully, can you blame this person?  Would you want your name attached to such a lame opinion?  Of course not!  I implore you to extend your Christian charity to poor OfficeName1234.  (Um, OfficeName1234, ""Christian"" refers to a group of religious people who believe in morals, ethics, and other such radical ideas that are completely foreign to Bill Clinton and his ilk.  You probably are more familiar with referring to them as ""radicals"", what with all that praying, and helping the poor, and valuing life, and all that other ""moral"" stuff they do.)

Subject: To Chuy's defenders 
Dear OfficeName1234, 
It is definitely working.  The world is being made aware of Chuy's  actions 
and the Dems are lining up to eat that crap Chuy's calls tex-mex. 
Talk about poetic justice.  May you all gag on a giant hairball. 
Just who is it that ever complained about the Clinton or Gore kids? They got 
a pass on everything, even when little Al was thrown out of school for his 
drug abuse. That Chuy's grease  has clogged your mind, 
JR 
PS  Why don't you sign your name to your courageous pronouncements?

Subject: HoustonChronicle.com 
Isn't it funny that the same people who would have been screaming the 
loudest 
about the ""immorality"" of Bill and Hilary Clinton had their daughter, 
Chelsea, been cited for underage drinking  are the same people who now find 
the treatment of the Bush family so ""outrageous?""  I can't stand Chuy''s 
because their food is too heavy but I plan to eat there every week just to 
offset the amazing level of hypocrisy I have seen in the several e-mails I 
have received related to this subject.

"Invitation: Practical Steps to Spectrum Markets, November 9,	2001","Please do not reply to this message. Register on-line at http://www.aei.org/inv011109.htm

PRACTICAL STEPS TO SPECTRUM MARKETS

Why is it that wireline bandwidth is traded as a commodity while federal regulation effectively blocks the formation of similar markets for wireless? Given the key role of wireless technologies in today's telecommunications sector, the Joint Center will convene a group of experts to discuss this pertinent policy question. Panelists will debate reforms such as liberalization of wireless licenses issued by the FCC, streamlining methods to resolve interference disputes, and other practical steps to enable market allocation of radio spectrum.

Character Building

During the winter months, with all the snow and cold, you probably
notice the icicles that often form on houses, cars, and trees. Bet you
didn't think of them having a spiritual lesson embedded in them did
you?

Have you ever stopped to consider how they are formed? Have you noticed
that the dripping water froze, one drop at a time, until over a period
of days, the icicle was a foot long or more. If the water is clean, the
icicle remains clear and sparkles brightly in the sunlight; but if the
water is ever so slightly muddy, that icicle will be cloudy. The beauty
and brilliance will be spoiled.

Our character is formed in like manner. Each thought,
every feeling, and all of our actions influence the whole, bit by bit.
Each decision that we make, both great and small, contributes its part.
Everything we take into our minds and souls -- the impressions,
experiences, and words we absorb and use -- all of these work together
to create our character.

We should be aware of the ""droplets of influence"" we allow to slowly
build our lives. After all, Solomon said, ""The integrity of the upright
shall guide them."" (Proverbs 11:3)

When the Son shines on your life -- are you clear and clean, or has
your character become cloudy? What droplets of influence are you
putting into your character?

"Very Important!!!","To my dearest precious husband,

Please reread every word of this and do it because you love me.

""Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all you who hope in
the Lord.""  - Psalm 31:24

Courage belongs to those who know God, says the psalmist.  And, I say we all
need to continually affirm God's power to protect us.  Today I have created
a litany which affirms our faith in God's power, so that we need never be
afraid.  Since our current situation strikes fear in our hearts, read this
litany of courage and praise.  You need never be afraid!

	When I am being tested beyond measure in my job responsibilities ...
		I will put my trust in God.
	When I am facing the greatest hurdles of my life...
		The Lord gives me courage!
	When I feel like I am completely alone...
		The Lord is my light and salvation!
	When I feel like the bottom is falling out...
		My heart shall know no fear!  God will save me!
	When I have no other answers or solutions...
		God will send the help I need!
	When I go through every terrifying minute of the day...
		I am expecting the Lord to rescue me!
	When I think failure is upon me...
		I am brave, for God's power is greater than any situation I could possibly
face today.


""FEAR NOT, FOR I HAVE REDEEMED YOU; I HAVE CALLED YOU BY YOUR NAME, KEN AND
BEAU, YOU ARE MINE.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE WATERS AND GREAT TROUBLE I WILL
BE WITH YOU.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH RIVERS, THEY SHALL NOT OVERFLOW YOU.  WHEN
YOU WALK THROUGH THE FIRE YOU SHALL NOT BE BURNED, NOR THE FLAME SCORCH YOU.
FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, YOUR SAVIOR...YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY SIGHT, YOU
HAVE BEEN HONORED, AND I HAVE LOVED YOU.  FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU.""
Isaiah 43:1-5

The bottom line of our life should be faith, not fear, so live today
controlled by God-inspired positive thoughts!!!

Love and prayers,
Your Hon

 Subject: NEW VIRUS uses WTC to entice the unwary
A new virus called W32.vote.a@mm uses a social a engineering ploy to
entice the recipient to execute it.  The Vote worm is the first virus (of
many
expected viruses) clearly connected to the World Trade Center attack of
September 11. It arrives with an e-mail message containing the following:

    Subject:          Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa And IsLaM !
    Body:        Hi
                 iS iT A waR Against AmeriCa Or IsLaM !?
                 Let's Vote To Live in Peace!
    Attachment:       WTC.EXE

 If the user runs the attachment, Vote executes several programs:

      It mass E-mails itself to everyone in you address book

      Them overwrites ALL files ending in .htm or .html with the text:
          AmeRiCa ...Few Days WiLL Show You What We Can Do !!!  It's Our
      Turn >>> ZaCkEr is So Sorry For You .

      Then tries to delete all files in the WINDOWS directory
      add a FORMAT C: (ERASE ALL FILES) command to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
      display a message box containing the text:
           ""I promiss We WiLL Rule The World Again...By The Way,You Are
      Captured By ZaCker !!!""
      and exit Windows.

 The normal TSC E-mail system is protected against this virus BUT if you
 access other E-mail systems either at work or at home, there is a
 possibility you will see this virus and it will most likely be sent from
someone you would recognize.

 Please remember to PRACTICE SAFE COMPUTING by:

      DO NOT OPEN ""ENTICING"" E-MAILS (From anyone) without checking to make
      sure they actually sent it
      KEEP YOUR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE AND DATA FILES UPDATED (McAfee data
file is currently at DAT 4162)
      IF YOUR COMPUTER STARTS BEHAVING ERRATICALLY - CONTACT YOUR IS PERSON
      ASAP
      BE SURE TO HAVE BACK-UP COPIES OF ALL YOUR FILES

 Also, please remember that THE COMPUTER YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN.

"RFF Workshop -Dec.11","Dear Ken :

I am pleased to extend an invitation to you to attend a workshop on ""The
Distributional Impacts of Carbon Mitigation Policies: Various Lenses on the
Issue,"" hosted by Resources for the Future in its first floor conference
center (1616 P Street NW, Washington, DC) on December 11, 2001. Supported
by the Energy Foundation, this workshop will present the results of new
research conducted by RFF scholars on the critical question of who would
pay should the U.S. undertake carbon mitigation measures.

As described in the attached agenda, four papers will be presented.  A
common focus for discussion is how much compensation might be justified for
different sectors, the form such compensation might take, and the
institutions that may be involved.  In order to facilitate free and open
discussion, this is a closed meeting with a limited number of invitees.  I
hope you can join us on the 11th from 8:30 a.m. - 12:15 p.m. and then stay
for an informal lunch. Please RSVP by November 30 to Karin Warner
(202-328-5177 or warner@rff.org).

I look forward to seeing you there.

By what I read, you've had quite a time lately.  Keep up the great work!.

The above will be held at the Houston Club and will be quite a fun event.  I
believe ENRON has participated in the past.  Tables of 10 are available for
$5000 and $2500.  There will be a very nice silent auction, too.  As you
know, the DHD, on whose board I sit, does great things for the old part of
downtown and many of the facades are a product of the DHD's grants.

We would really appreciate ENRON's participation.

"thank you","Ken,

I feel terrible in writing this email to inform you that I am leaving Enron.
The timing of my departure is purely coincidental to the timing of the recent
events.

It has been a special and rewarding privilege to work at Enron over the past
three and a half years.  The integrity and high purpose you stand for is a
personal inspiration to me.  Seeing your leadership first-hand has been a
real treat.

Receiving the Chairman's Award last year was an incredible honor.  It is
difficult for me to feel truly deserving of it because of the sheer numbers
of amazingly dedicated, yet unrecognized heroes I have met at Enron.  I have
the greatest admiration of them and draw my inspiration from them.

One regret in leaving is that there will be those at Enron who will use my
departure as more negative fodder to taint the company image.  I wouldn't
ever wish that on you, especially in light of the recent challenges you are
experiencing.  So I apologize if that does come to pass.

One factor in my departure has been my disappointment with personnel abuses
I've observed with EES' origination management.  There is a general feeling 
of despair because the management chain looks the other way and the concept 
of an ""open door"" is political suicide.  H.R. is as much at fault in my 
opinion because they side with management as opposed to taking an objective 
view and judgement of the abuses.  My words and credibility may not carry 
any weight as I too have been victimized by the character assassination 
that is all too common at EES.

Though my emotions run high when I think about the injustices to good employees 
(and lost potential benefit to Enron), I leave with no bad feelings toward the company
and am proud to have been a part of Enron.

The shift in EES' business model had resulted in my taking on a new role this
past spring.  Being based outside of Houston (in the Chicago area), my career
opportunities are limited.  And as much as I tried, I was feeling stale and
unfulfilled in this new role and decided that it would be better for me to
move on.

Ken, I believe in you and wish you success and redemption through this difficult 
time.  I wish that I could have done more.  

If I can ever help, I hope that you won't hesitate to ask.  Thank you again.

Respectfully,

"Information on ENRON Broadband","
Gentlemen:
 
As I mentioned to Nathan, Infolink has an interest from a financier capable of providing us with up to $400M for the purchase of Enron assets.
 
I have a teleconference scheduled with them on Wednesday morning and need more information to provide them ASAP.
 
Nathan has mentioned that other parties have been in discussions to purchase Enron Broadband (in whole). I am assuming that a due-diligence package exists. What I am looking for is:
 
1)       A complete list of assets (fiber routes, co-location facilities, equipment).
2)       Balance Sheet and Income statement for Enron Broadband. Please breakout the income statement by month and category.
3)       Customer List along with MRRsand terms of contracts
4)       Any Continuing Financial Commitments (leases, etc.) that exist.
 
We already have an executed confidentiality agreement. If something else is required, please let me know ASAP.
 
Yours truly,
 
Prieur J. Leary, III/CEO

ENRON CORP.

Mr. Greg Walley, President   

Mr. Kenneth Lay, CEO

Dear Sirs

WWI INVESTMENT CORP. development programs foresees the building of prototypes and massive production of Spin-Quantum Energy generators, reactors and motors in Europe. This is a non polluting energy, available in quantities without limits. 

Our target is the serial manufacturing of generators, reactors and motors all over the world to replace motors and hydroelectric, thermoelectric and atomic generators presently in use. The energy cost will be reduced to less than 1/10 of the current price and  we are sure the Spin-Quantum Energy will make gasoline, diesel and alcohol obsolete. 

WWI INVESTMENT CORP is the owner of the rights to manufacture the products. Taking into account the problems ENRON is facing now and our intention of accelerating WWI CORP development program, we consider that US$20 Billion, represented by assets and rights, can be transferred to ENRON. Should we jointly carry out the plan I keep in mind, within a period of six years, both companies will be merged into the most powerful corporation of the world.

We would like to arrange a meeting with you as soon as possible, and discuss this matter in details.

Best Regards.

Francisco Jose Ortiz y Carrillo

Mr.  Lay:
 
Believe it or  not I strongly believe in and practice the values listed below.  I really  did expect Enron to believe them and practice them as  well.
 
What Enron did  to us Monday afternoon is not in accordance to the values listed  below.
 
I'm now on the  brink of bankruptcy because I cannot find a job.  I'm 49 years old and  because I enlisted in the Navy during Vietnam, with 9 years service instead of  going on to college, I do not have a degree.  I have more experience than  most anyone with a degree, but so far that doesn't help.  Most  times all they look at is that piece of paper.
 
I hope someday  you feel what I'm feeling and understand what I'm going through.  You  guys that did this with your millions in reserve probably never will fully  understand.
 
Sincerely,

"Fw: Enron Kids","
 
My child, Dane, was previously enrolled in Enron Kids.  Since I was laid off last Monday, I had to take him out.  I understand through Lorraine Gibbs that the daycare has now opened up to the public.  What is the possibility of coming down on the monthly charge?  
 
I think it would be a nice gesture to the parents that previously had kids enrolled there to be able to bring their child(ren) back instead of having to enroll them into another daycare.  I understand that I will not be able to pay $560 a month since Enron will not be subsidizing, but it would be nice if Enron could lower the rate to $600 per child.  Enron Kids is a wonderful place with wonderful teachers.  It would be a shame to have to close such a facility.
 
Please consider this.  It would be very important to several parents if they could have their child(ren) back downtown at the same daycare.  
 
I know that there are many parents interested in bringing their child back to Enron Kids.  I also have talk to other downtown parents who would possibly be interested in brining their child downtown if the rate was lowered.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.

"Associate / Analyst Program","
After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

"","Ken, I am a loyal Enron Employee for over 17 years and my opinion (however insignificant) is that we stand and fight and not take any buy out offer from anyone.

I know that I speak for the rest of my team when I say lets stand and fight and not sell out to the first bidder who will not give us what we are really worth.  We are the best and continue to be the best in the energy world, that is my attitude every day that I proudly come to work.  

Please reconsider and take our lumps like Columbia Gas System, like Continental Airlines and get back into solvency the best way we know how to.  The past is past, lets pick up ourselves by our boot straps and get back into the fight and win this one.

You know that you can count on me and the rest of my team in ETS to stand by this decision to stand and fight.

Ever Loyal and willing to serve.

Rudy Elizondo (ETS).

ps If you need more inspirational speeches from me, I will be happy to oblige.

"The Adizes Way to Manage in Difficult Times","
MV_Logo_AdizesToPrime_smaller.jpgAdizes_logo_smaller.jpg	
  	
   In this uncertain world, how do we set priorities?    The Wall Street Journal posed this issue in its September 25th edition:    ""Managing Employees who are both traumatized and experiencing a sea  change in their attitudes toward their work poses immediate and long-term challenges for bosses. In the next few weeks, bosses must ask themselves what level of performance they can expect of employees who have been deeply shaken by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. And over the coming months, they must figure out how to foster both teamwork and commitment among those they supervise -- qualities that will be crucial for coping with the deepening economic downturn and fight against terrorism.""    ""....many are having difficulty giving full attention to their jobs. Managers are apt to encounter employees who can't focus on jobs that now seem to them insignificant or even frivolous. Concern about family, friends, national security and the political uncertainties that lie ahead are taking precedence over old preoccupations.""  People are balancing lifestyle and workplace priorities as never before. Managers can help employees, and even themselves, through this change with a better understanding of how management styles differ.   Our online course Teamwork Plus! can provide the basic principles and objective language to discuss the impact of these changing priorities within your team.   We invite you to take three minutes to experience the power of our online course by understanding your own Management Style . And then, if you think a more objective understanding of management styles would be useful, please pass this email on to your colleagues who you think would benefit.   It is important for people in a team to talk to each other when changes are happening ""within"" people as well as ""within"" the organization. The vocabulary your team will learn in our course can foster trust and understanding. Teamwork Plus! shows how each management style is integrated into a well functioning team and how people with different management styles deal with change. For example, to get co-workers back on track, more ""I"" (integration) might be needed from everyone. If your biggest ""P"" (producer) now wants to put more of his energy into coaching his son's baseball games because he has reached a new balance in the priorities around family and job, it is important to understand the ""P"" (producer) will probably change the balance in favor of the job in a while. Some more scenarios are in this month's Teamwork Newsletter.   Register  for our monthly one page newsletter and qualify to have your organization win a free $US 495 course. When you register, please enter your qualifying number 2300 for a chance to win this free course. A different number will be selected  each month.   Teamwork Plus! provides the basic principles which lead to personal growth and dramatic improvements in organizational teamwork.

"The issue nears","Finally we're forging ahead. We plan on publishing our much-delayed and
much-changed Aspen special issue in two weeks. We're really excited. We're
focusing now on the issue of globalization in the post-September 11 world.
All of your contributions in Aspen aided us immensely.
    The issue is going to be an unusual print-online package. In addition to
articles in the magazine that relate in various ways to the Aspen meeting,
we will be posting significant additional material online. For those of you
who answered our three questions prior to the meeting, we will be publishing
all of those--in full--on Fortune.com. But we also want to hear from you
about how your views have changed since August.
    We'd like you to answer the same three questions again now, assuming
your answers would now be different. Or you can simply send us a statement
about how your comments remain reflective of your views, or how and why you
think something else matters more.
    Our three questions were:
1) Once upon a time we committed ourselves to putting a man on the moon.
What kind of similar commitment should we make now? What's the ""moon shot""
of the 21st century?

2) As the world heads down its current path, what should we fear most?

3) What issue or issues will most define our future?

    We need your replies by November 8 at the latest. Please send them to me
and to jbensko@Fortune.com.
    btw, many of you have asked if you could get copies of your portrait by
Michael O'Neill. We plan on sending each of you a print along with the
special issue when it is published.
    Send in those answers! Now! Please!

"Financial Disclosure of $1.2 Billion Equity Adjustment","For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit that I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management and agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Management can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone else needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communication the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such as Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda intended to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these values so that no one would really notice that their actions represented something just the opposite.

I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human nature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you have said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with the statement ""It's just a balance-sheet issue""  implies to me that this individual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certainly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the game of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to present a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the definition of the word ""HEDGE"".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside and downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out asking customers to let Enron help them ""HEDGE"" their risk when I'm not sure Enron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?

I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow in the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confused in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say "" do as I say not as I do""? I guess we need to have audits performed of Senior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as their word?

The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these transactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opinion is ""CRIMINAL"".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perpetrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and need to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, having all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you were hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involved and to institute criminal charges.   

I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a thorough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job performance to date.

"Keeping the Faith","Dear Mr. Lay,

I am sure no one could imagine the worry and mental
anguish you have had to endure these past weeks.  I
pray for you that you will continue to have the
strength to move forward during these trying times.

Mr. Lay, I'm really a ""nobody"".  I started my career
back in 1972 with Northern Petrochemical in Morris
Illinois.  I worked there for two years then quit to
return to college to earn my engineering degree.  I
graduated in 1979 at the age of 29.  Upon graduation,
I hired back with Northern Natural Gas in Liberal
Kansas.  I continued my career with Enron until
January 15 this year.  I had been expat with EE&CC
until Nov. 14, 2000.  When I returned to Houston, I
found out that I had been ""redeployed"".  To my
disappointment, I was unable to find another position
and was severed on Jan. 15, 2001.  As you can imagine,
by saving my money, working hard, and receiving stock
options, I had accumulated enough money to go ahead
and retire.  I was feeling good about my career, my
life with Enron, the years of sacrificing time and
effort for the betterment of the company.  (You know,
in spite of what's happened since Jan. 15, I still
feel good about all the years I dedicated to the
company.)  You know what else, I still have the upmost
respect and confidence in you.  I really hope your
self confidence is not slipping.  You've accomplished
great things with this company.  You can continue to
lead us through these trying times.  I know you can!

In closing, I just want to say ""thanks"".  Thanks for
being our leader all these years.  Thanks for the
""wild ride"" we've all shared since 1985.  I wouldn't
trade it for the world.  Please know that there are
many of us ""nobody"" people out here that still wish
you well, pray for you, and hope something positive
will surface in the near future.

Daniel Junk

P.S.  I know the Fed. Gov. loaned Chrysler billions a
few years back when they were against the ropes.  The
emphasis was on saving 200,000 or 300,000 jobs.
Wouldn't they do the same for Enron, considering all
the people whose retirements are dependent upon
Enron's performance?  Not just former employees, but
all investors?

Energy Expected on Political Front Burner in 2002

In the next six weeks, energy should be prominent in national politics.  The
Bush Administration is sure to return its attention to the national energy
policy in the State of the Union Address January 29.  The President is
expected to emphasize that economic recovery depends on congress passing his
domestic agenda, including the Administration's energy plan passed by the
House last year.  In the Senate, Majority Leader Tom Daschle has vowed to
bring an energy bill to the floor the week of February 11.  Also in
February, The White House is expected to release federal its budget, which
will reveal the spending priorities of the Administration, showing which
energy efficiency programs receive funding increases or funding cuts.

FreedomCAR Replaces PNGV as Government Body for Energy-Efficient Vehicle R&D

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced at the Detroit Auto Show that the
Partnership for Next Generation Vehicles (PNGV) will be replaced by a new
private-public partnership, called ""FreedomCAR.""  PNGV was a public-private
partnership designed to develop cars with triple the current fuel economy.
FreedomCAR, by contrast, has as its goal the production of hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles, which produce no emissions but water vapor and do not rely on
fossil fuels.

While supportive of fuel cell R&D, the Alliance noted in New York Times and
other media interviews that it should not be at the expense of badly needed
new fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, including SUVs.

A political cartoon by Stuart Carlson illustrates the point quickly and
humorously:

Primen: Consumers Say Energy Efficiency Now Top Issue in Home Appliance
Purchases

U.S. consumers now rank energy efficiency as their most important
consideration in shopping for new home appliances, according to a new study
by Madison-based Primen, an energy market-intelligence company.
Three-fourths of consumers said energy efficiency was a very important
factor in their purchase of appliances during the past year. More important,
84 percent said they anticipate that energy efficiency will be a ""very
important consideration"" in making future purchasing decisions.
Pro-efficiency sentiment ran strongest among California consumers, with an
overwhelming number of households claiming efficiency will outrank all other
factors in future appliance-purchasing decisions.

California Sees Big Savings by Tightening Efficiency Standards

The California Energy Commission (CEC) will propose adopting new efficiency
standards for ten products at a February 6 hearing, as mandated by
legislation in response to the state's electricity crisis. Products range
from air conditioners to traffic signals.  CEC's life-cycle-cost analysis
shows that the energy savings over the life of the product outweigh any
initial increased purchase cost.  Among the largest savers: electric
transformers reduce life-cycle-costs by $3,768; commercial air conditioners
by $2,580; and commercial refrigerators by $958.

A table illustrates savings from tighter standards:

Efficiency, Conservation Could Save NW States 300 Megawatts

Energy efficiency and conservation in the Northwest could yield as much
power as a new natural gas plant-an extra 300 megawatts over three
years-according to the Northwest Power Planning Council (NPPC). As a result
of these findings, NPPC is asking Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Washington to
invest in efficiency and conservation measures rather than the construction
of new power plants.  Power savings will come from a wide variety of
sources-from modernizing machinery to shutting down vending machines during
off-hours.  NPPC is a multi-state agency with a mandate to balance power
production and environmental concerns in the Pacific Northwest.

Study Cites Five-fold Return on Energy Training Investment in Plants

Investments in energy-efficiency training saved ICI Chemicals, a British
chemical company, ?500,000 (1992 currency) for a ?100,000 investment: a
ten-week payback.  This information was released in a paper written for the
Training Subcomittee of the BestPractices Steam Program.  ICI Chemicals
invested in its people, implementing a training program including direct
training, employing a full-time energy manager, metering, and expending
revenue on repairs and minor improvements.  These findings are explicated in
""The Human Side of Efficiency:  The Value of Training in Plant Systems
Optimization,"" which includes other examples of the value of training.  A
companion slide show to the paper links to further examples and resources of
how to implement a training program.

Energy Efficiency Methods Can Yield 50 Percent Reductions in Data Center
Power Requirements, Says REPP Report

The Information Technology industry and electric power utilities have a
""window of opportunity to define and implement best practices in data center
design and construction before the next Information Technology surge,"" notes
Renewable Energy Policy Project (REPP) Research Manager Fred Beck.

Based on extensive research and interviews with industry experts, Beck
details many practical efficiency measures that can be implemented today, as
well as identifying broader solutions such as ultra-efficient ""Energy Smart
Power Parks"" employing shared electricity production and cooling facilities.

CFLs Capture High California Marketshare

Energy Star compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) have captured a higher
marketshare in California than ever in the 20 year history of
energy-efficiency programs.  The expanded marketshare is due in part to the
""Instant Discount Retailer Program"" by California Investor Owned Utilities
(IOUs) to promote the purchase and use of CFLs by residential consumers in
partnership with retailers and manufacturers that were customer-oriented and
cost-effective.  Noted factors that have contributed to the success of the
2001 program include consumer education; greater accessibility of
next-generation CFLs, together with their higher quality, lower price, and
decreased size; and the competitive nature of the marketplace.

By the end of the Instant Discount Retailer Program in December 2001,
Pacific Gas and Electric Company reports that 42 retailers with 434
locations in Northern and Central California had participated to provide
discounts on 6 million CFLs accounting for $18 million dollars in
incentives.

'Static Electricity House' Brings Down House; Garners $16 Million Free TV
Airtime for Energy Efficiency Message

The Alliance to Save Energy obtained some $16 million of free TV airtime for
its ""Static Electricity House"" national TV PSA and a customized New York
version developed for the New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority.

Nielsen Sigma tracking reports that the national TV PSA was aired more than
38,000 times for 462 million total impressions from December 2000 through
December 2001.  Additionally, the national TV PSA was picked up by the ABC
and CBS TV networks, CNN Headline News, other cable networks, local cable
operators, and CNN Airport Network at 35 major airports which are not
tracked by Nielsen and which would push all of the total values
significantly higher.

More than a year later, past this tracking time frame, there are reports of
sightings this month in San Francisco and Washington D.C. markets and on
cable. Typical of the e-mails received by the Alliance, Eve Norman of San
Francisco writes: ""I LOVE this commercial. This has got to be one of the
funniest spots I've ever seen. First time I saw it, I was dozing on the
couch, woke up thinking for a moment that it was serious. What a great idea:
using static electricity. Of course, I then realized it was a very clever
spoof.  Thanks, for a good laugh plus valuable information.""

DRAM, Alliance Partner to 'Advance' Advanced Metering Technologies

The Alliance, in coordination with the Demand Response and Advanced Metering
Coalition (DRAM) is developing plans for new initiatives in the area of
metering, which may include consumer awareness programs, work on technology
standards and other related areas.  For several years, the Alliance has been
monitoring policy and developments in the area of advanced metering, and in
particular time-of-use and real-time metering.   These technologies have
received a great deal of attention recently, as they have been increasingly
deployed in so-called ""demand response"" programs, which help save energy and
money by consumers.

Energy Efficiency Is Patriotism

A new web site has been created for people who want to contribute to the
effort against terrorism and who want to address the primary causes both of
anti-American sentiment and American dependence on foreign oil.  America
consumes a disproportionate share of world oil resources, which has brought
a disproportionate amount of risk to America - risks to our health, safety,
economy, and national security.

At www.SaveABarrel.org, visitors are asked to take a ""Patriot's Energy
Pledge.""   The Patriot's Energy Pledge Campaign(tm) SaveaBarrel.org(tm)
website was developed by ""a bipartisan group of concerned citizens who
strongly believe that reducing our country's use of oil is essential to our
national security.""

"Congressman Bentsen and the Trade Promotion Authority","Ken Bentsen deserves your thanks and a note or a phone call from you.
(see below for phone number and address).   I called Congressman Bentsen
yesterday to express the Partnership's support on the Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) bill. Yesterday, the bill passed in Congress by one vote
(215 to 214). Ken Bentsen's vote made the difference. When I spoke with
him, he told me how difficult it would be for him to make that vote, and
that he had been lobbied hard by the labor unions, the Cabinet and the
President. I urged him to vote for the bill and told him what the impact
would be to Houston and the region*.
In the final analysis, the bill passed thanks to your fellow Houstonian
and Congressman, Ken Bentsen. He made the difference. The Congressman,
the Partnership and you had an impact on that vote.
Hope to see you on Tuesday, December 11 at the Houston Club for the
final board meeting of 2001.
*U.S. exports support 12 million U.S. jobs, including one-in-five
manufacturing jobs, and account for almost one-third of real U.S.
economic growth over the past decade.

"The coming trip on May 29th","Ken, 
With your permission, Harry and I will plan to bring our golf clubs on the  
airplane on Tuesday.  I plan to buy one of those little traveling golf bags  
(very small) and carry only about 5 or 6 of my clubs with me. Mick may or may  
not do the same.  It's your call if this is OK for the plane and whether or  
not you bring yours.  This way when Harry and I get to betting on the game,  
we will not have the quality of the rent clubs as an excuse for the quality

"","Ken and Greg:

Prior to your potential meeting on Wednesday, I just wanted to get my two cents in with respect to Heath Schiesser and the Xlerator.

I vote in favor of supporting the Xlerator based on a few rationales:
First and foremost, Heath is a quality player - with a unique set of skills that would contribute to Enron's human capital;
The discipline that the Xlerator would bring to new businesses, in and of itself, probably justifies its existence:  for example, I believe that the investment in AMPS approaches $20 million - much of which is at risk due to inadequate discipline; and
The Xlerator appears to be a low cost R&D option of relatively limited size while compared to Enron - that may very well incubate businesses which create meaningful value for Enron.
At the same time, I acknowledge the costs, both financial and resources, and risks but feel the above benefits are greater.

Although support from the Management Committee would be nice, I believe that support from you two would provide the foundation upon which Heath and the Xlerator can be successful.

I don't know much about the vast world of business and i'm not extremely knowledgeable about the happenings within the corporation, but I do know about perseverance.  I understand that you made Enron the powerhouse that it is through perseverance, and no matter how difficult things are right now, Enron will return to the top.  I respect you a great deal as a businessman, and I know that you will find a way to bring the company out of these times.

"credibility","
Ken--
    For what it's worth, here's a  little perspective from some distance.  
 
    A billion dollars here, a  billion there,  it's adding up to serious numbers.  But even worse is  the loss of what was once, not long ago, a great stock of trust and credibility,  both for Enron and Ken Lay personally.  Sunday's NY Times front page of the  Business Section story is about as bad as it gets, short of suspicions of  personal dishonesty or criminal culpability. Suspicion or innuendo that  maybe you didn't fully understand the deals must hurt as bad as any of the  barbs.  The old dumb-but-honest defense is not something you want to use in  this case, anyway.  And I doubt you could convince many people you didn't  understand it.
 
    The analogy of Clinton &  Nixon in their darkest hours comes to mind.  Nixon's ""I am not a crook""  speech or Clinton's ""I did not have sex with that woman"" did not fix their  problems.  When things get this bad the best (maybe only) way to re-coup is  get really candid and lay all the cards on the table face up (with one important  caveat about which more later.) Humility, contrition & candor are the  antidotes for hubris, arrogance & deviousness, whether they were real or  just perceived.
 
    In whatever the right venue  is, and I'm unsure on that, I'd like to see you tell the world:
 
    This is what we  did.
    This is why we did  it.
    This is why we were confident  it was wholly proper.
    This is why it didn't come out  as well as we had hoped.
    This what we believe it  might cost us when all is said & done.
    And I will answer any  questions you have on any of this because we have to 
      get it behind  us and get on with running an ongoing business.
 
    With the press on your case,  and the SEC, and Enron's high Bush-related profile, and its critical position in  the markets, and the tantalizing non-coincidence of Jeff's recent sudden  departure -- this is a story that has legs.  It's going to sell newspapers,  fuel gossip and energize competitors until the fire's out and the smoke has  dissipated. National TV coverage is a possibility even, but for anthrax and  Osama-gate.  For you to try to spoon-feed the pack on your heels will  just make the story last longer and get juicer.  Only a pre-emptive  total disclosure can quench it even half as quickly as you'd hope  for.
 
    BUT THE CAVEAT.  If  anybody is  exposed to personal criminal liability, then it ain't nearly so  simple.  In those circumstances, the best attorney you can get will have to  counsel every move.  And both the person and the corporation would need  their own separate lawyers because interests can diverge very fast.   
 
    I don't think for a minute  that this is a real issue.  But I didn't think I'd see a  $15 stock  price either.  The enormity of this quake has shaken even those who only  wish you the best.  Imagine how good it makes the hyenas feel.
 
    As I said before, Lots of  luck, Buddy.  You need it worse that I ever thought you would.   Kindest regards to Linda, too.
 
Ross

"(no subject)","Dear Enron Chairman, Board of Directors and Investor Relations  
ENRON STOCK IS FREE FALLING AND LOT OF CLEVER  TRADERS ARE SHORTING WHILE THE NEW YORK EXCHANGE SPECIALIST, ANALYSTS, MEDIA  JOIN THEM TO COMPOUND THE PROBLEM and now S& P downgrade
so here are some ideas....
You ALL must work very very hard  till Monday morning  NONSTOP to help Enron, stockholders, Employees and all....by taking these steps
1) Get Warren Buffet/ and kind to take a position.........even a token one....it will boost lot of faith
2) Disclose the impact of the financial partnerships  ...1 billion, 2 or what?..a specific bottom-line.....with maximum cap...the investment community is begging you to say something
3) Speak up......Engage media into positive news..... some thing positive about Enron's business and future
wall street hates solence....no matter what your lawyers are telling you/......you must make strong positive statements
4) Please talk to Royal Dutch (Shell)/Duke and  competition about possible merger and stuff
5) see if u can get an upgrade from a broker...who really sees the value in the stock.......in spite of problems....talk to wall street/barrons
6) If someone can claim the responsibility.....this is the time....and lets move on with the right foot forward
7) Ask emlpoyess/management to buy stock to support it
8) Your 2 worst enemies are the people who are shorting the stock & one who are saying bad things about Enron..... REQUEST people to stop shorting &  saying irresponsible statements about the company....They are truly driving a great company to the ground.........
thats not easy or conventional, but it can help people understand where the real decline is coming from and the true problems are much smaller than what media will like it to be
9) work harder..overtime.....long hours..to improve business......starting from top.....practically 7 days a week....to show the world..that when going gets tough..neron does everything it can....beacuse it believes in ultimate sacrifice.....and commitment
10)  Calculate the asset and liabilities worth and show the world..what you are truly worth......even on a conservative business
an open advertisement or interview
resources....assets.....liabilities.....amount of sales.....profits.....small interesting facts.....you can give it in a informal interview to a Houston paper...cnbc....or CNN.....it will do you good
so people can understand your story better
and lastly, i am born in India and live in USA for 31 years.....i know the culture and i can help you with the negotiations in India......i am very good at this and want you to call me to get my input
i have over 73000 shares of Enron and i am hurting like many others....so i want to do everything to help you

3) New RFF Publications
Discounting the Benefits of Climate Change Mitigation: How Much Do
Uncertain Rates Increase Valuations?

How can we compare the costs of greenhouse gas reduction measures taken
today with the future benefits of these actions?  This new report for the
Pew Center on Global Climate Change challenges conventional wisdom and
concludes that immediate action to address global climate change could
yield significantly greater benefits in the long-run than conventional
economic models suggest.

Richard Newell and William Pizer | December 2001

Reforming Permitting

The system of U.S. pollution control permitting is suffering from major
defects and weaknesses; it is often fragmented and inefficient. Although
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the states have initiated
reforms, the United States is among a dwindling number of industrialized
nations that have not yet adopted an integrated approach to pollution
control.

Terry Davies with Robert Hersh, Aracely Alicea, and Ruth Greenspan Bell |
December 2001

http://www.rff.org/reports/PDF_files/reformingpermitting.pdf


Discussion Papers:
Implementing Electricity Restructuring: Policies, Potholes, and Prospects

Electricity is one of the last U.S. industries in which competition is
replacing regulation. This paper reviews the technology for producing and
delivering power, the history of electricity policy, and recent state and
international experience. It outlines the major questions facing
policymakers as they decide whether, when, and how to implement
restructuring and concludes with some thoughts on the California
electricity crisis and other political controversies. This paper draws upon
the forthcoming book, Alternating Currents: Electricity Markets and Public
Policy.

Timothy J. Brennan, Karen Palmer, and Salvador Martinez | December 2001
For more information go to:
http://www.rff.org/disc_papers/PDF_files/0162.pdf


Is There a Rationale for Rebating Environmental Levies?

Political pressure often exists for rebating environmental levies,
particularly when incomplete regulatory coverage allegedly creates an
""unlevel playing field"" with other, unregulated firms or industries. This
paper assesses the conditions under which rebating environmental levies is
justified for the regulated sector.

Alain Bernard, Carolyn Fischer, and Marc Vielle  | October 2001
For more information go to:
http://www.rff.org/disc_papers/PDF_files/0131.pdf


Ancillary Benefits of Reduced Air Pollution in the United States from
Moderate Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Policies in the Electricity Sector

This paper considers how moderate actions to slow atmospheric accumulation
of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use also could reduce conventional air
pollutants in the United States. The benefits that result would be
""ancillary"" to greenhouse gas abatement. Moreover, the benefits would tend
to accrue locally and in the near term, while benefits from reduced climate
change mostly accrue globally and over a time frame of several decades or
longer.

and Cary Bloyd | December 2001

"Wisdom","Dad,
I know this has been more difficult than I can conceive, so I did what every
good seminary student should and looked for something that might help a
little.  Solomon, when he was made king, asked only for wisdom and God gave
it to him as well as many other blessings.  The wisdom, as you well know,
helped him to be a great ruler.  There is no doubt God has already given you
great wisdom and will continue to bless your life.

You are always in my prayers.

Love,
Mark


5 In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said,
Ask what I shall give thee.
6 And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my father great
lovingkindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in
righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for
him this great lovingkindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his
throne, as it is this day.
7 And now, O Jehovah my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
David my father: and I am but a little child; I know not how to go out or
come in.
8 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a
great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
9 Give thy servant therefore an understanding heart to judge thy people,
that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this thy
great people?
  1 Kings 3:5-9 (ASV)

29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east,
and all the wisdom of Egypt.
  1 Kings 4:29-30 (ASV)

ken, i've been following your travails at enron with
great sadness. i think i know how frustrating and
disappointing it must be to see such a great company
in such a mess. i've been reluctant to bother you
since im sure you are up to your eyeballs in i-bankers
and lawyers. but i felt i needed to send you a note to
tell you that you still have friends and admirers--and
where the blame lies--with your ex- CAO(chief
arrogance officer). once you get the decks cleared, i
hope we can find some time again for carribean cruises
or whatever. i think the world of your strategic and
leadership skills and if you want to start something
again to change the world there is no one id rather
partner with. i hope it goes without saying that if
there is anything i can do personally or
professionally to help. all you need to do is ask. eric

We're preparing our Annual End of Year Issue this week and wanted to ask for your participation. The issue is a sort of combo issue merging all of our publications (The Desk, The Risk Desk, New Power Exec and The Bandwidth Desk), and takes a look at trends, review of the year in about 20 categories (tech, policy, VC stuff, market trends, credit, strategies, risk, book reviews, weather) and of course a look ahead. Most of the submitted pieces we run are in the form of commentaries on specific topics -- we're trying to stay away from the usual broad, mushy stuff you read about this time of the year -- translation, we're looking for a detailed view of things -- open with a short take on key bits that occurred this year, how it may have altered the course of the market or a particular sector (why or why not with details) and finally what's ahead. The general formula works well we've found; we expect the issue to be at least 40 pages this year. I'm sure you remember the drill from last year. Anyhow, back to you. What I'm looking for is this -- the fall of some big players has certainly put more focus on better risk management -- great, but what does that really mean? Consider some of the commentaries or interviews you're run in the past on the strategy/tactics side, and rethink the juicy bits. What have we (the traded markets, or retail for that matter) not yet fully learned or embraced? Do you think next year will see an altogether different power market? Why or why not. Specific changes in your space? Each year for the past 5 years, there has been one big event that has seemingly changed the way we do or think about things. What will this year mean to 2002? Whether in terms of systems, credit, ops, venture investment, risk management, marketing, managing the book, whatever. The key in this, is detail and specifics. What's it going to take to get people to play smarter? Need about 1000 words (more or less, your call), which you can probably do over cheerios in the morning. The deadline is Dec. 18. We'll be spinning out the issue to about 5,000 people, so the exposure should be very good for you--we'll include contact names and numbers etc. If this is doable, please let me know asap. Otherwise, hope you and the fam are well. 
Best, 
John

From:   Ronnie Chan     
Dear Ken, 
While receiving a report from Paula Rieker just now on the October 30 board meeting which I missed, I reiterated what I said in the previous board meeting.  Namely, Paul Volcker and I have for several years co-chaired the Hong Kong Economic Cooperation Committee (now called the Hong Kong-U.S. Business Council).  He and I have known each other for almost fifteen years.  If you want but fail to reach him, please let me know and I shall be happy to try.  
Kind Regards, 
Ronnie Chan

"Message from Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman","

Management Committee Members:

In light of today's meeting being canceled, we would like for you to give consideration to Jeff Huff as a candidate for Commercial Support VP.  Jeff has interviewed with Mark Frevert, Ray Bowen and Steve Kean who have given favorable feedback.  At this time, we would like to proceed with an offer.  Please contact us with any concerns or questions by the close of business Thursday.  If we have no opposing votes, we will proceed.

Below are a few points and a resume for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been working at Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff

Dear Mr. Lay,
I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am very sorry to see the developments relating to the proud company that you built, and to say thank you for the time I spent under your leadership.  I was with Enron for two and a half years, and I enjoyed that period as much as any time in my career.
>From my first exposure to you, the new employee orientation, I was very impressed by your willingness to address the group, and as you walked by on your way out, you smiled and nodded at me.  I was confident that I had made the right decision to join Enron. I also respect your sincere interest in the community, and the efforts that were undertaken to help those less fortunate. I believe that you handled the California energy issue with exactly the right amount of finesse and determination on behalf of Enron. Your willingness to forego the significant payments available to you under your contract is another example of the type of person that you are. I think that what might have impressed me the most, however, is the Christmas gathering on the 50th floor two years ago when you took time out of your valuable day to greet and take pictures with a long line of the rank and file employees, including contract security personnel.  The list goes on and on, requiring mu! ch more time and space than is available here.
You have earned my respect, and I wish you the absolute best in the future.  If there is ever anything that I can do to help in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I have significant experience in customer/supplier relationships, contracts, and I am a very effective negotiator.
Again, thank you for all that you have done for me, the energy industry, and the city of Houston. 
Sincerely,
Tom Moore

"FW: Government Affairs Organization Announcement","FYI

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Dernehl, Ginger  
Sent:	Friday, November 16, 2001 2:45 PM
To:	Shapiro, Richard
Subject:	Government Affairs Organization Announcement


With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to effect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving the company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are by their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of this group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the responsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicated group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard work, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done.

As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along functional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The need to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will jointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to help Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a leadership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electricity will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   Last, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus on California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team).

Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/legislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that will address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate development efforts across the U.S.

Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will continue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahim will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also continue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over support of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Markets, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for South America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Committee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman, Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also continue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry Kingerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am forming a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself.

No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perfect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more prepared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as the future unfolds for the company.

One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our group fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each other and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, for those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excellence and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do all I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the very best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.

As background for Mr. Lay's call to Sanjiv Sidhu of i2 concerning the EnronOnline opportunity, here is a brief summary of where we stand and our suggestions:

History of Enron/i2 Discussions

i2 was one the initial companies contacted by Enron Net Works (ENW) for the EnronOnline commercial discussion.
The focus of the Enron/i2 discussion earlier this year was a complete sale of the software asset that drives EnronOnline to i2.
i2 expressed considerable interest in the opportunity below the executive level, but ENW had difficulty getting a concrete bid or proposal from i2.
In order to get the discussion started, ENW provided an offer to i2.
i2's response to the Enron offer was that they considered it high and that they would prefer to partner with Enron in some manner in addition to some form of purchase.
ENW expressed interest in talking with i2 about this and requested that they outline their preferred deal to Enron.
ENW never received a term sheet or other information on a new price and partnering concept from i2.

Current Status of EnronOnline Commercial Initiative

Since those early discussions with i2, ENW has discussed the EnronOnline opportunity with other selected technology companies, and is now considering bids from several potential counterparties.  
Generally speaking the deal structure that appears to provide the best opportunity for both parties entails involvement by ENW after the transaction, in the form of equity participation or royalty payments or both, as well as the transfer of some Enron people.  
This seems to move us into the realm of a ""partnership"" structure that could fit the initial i2 interest.

Current Enron/i2 Status

Rex Shelby talked briefly with Greg Brady, i2 CEO, at a conference in NYC two weeks ago.  
Greg Brady expressed interest in renewing talks around the EnronOnline opportunity.  

Current Status of the Sale Opportunity

We are now reaching the point in the process at which we need to determine whether there is an interest from i2.
We want to make sure we give i2 the opportunity to outline a proposal with a price as well as outline their needs for a relationship going forward, or to confirm that they are not interested.

Suggested Message to Sanjiv Sidhu

Our suggested message to Sanjiv is:
.
1.	Enron remains interested in exploring this opportunity with i2 if there is a genuine interest from i2.
2.  	Enron is open to considering deal structures that provide incentive for participation by Enron after the transaction.
3.  	Enron is moving down the path with other parties, so if i2 has an interest, we would need to start working with them soon.

Thank you for your assistance on this.  Please let us know if you need more information.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","Mr Lay - If you really think that this sale creates a ""great opportunity"" for shareholders then you are more out of touch with reality than I previously thought (unless you were referring to Dynegy shareholders). Under your ""leadership"" the shareholders have been devastated, employees have lost their retirements, college funds have been desiminated and reputations have been ruined, including your own. 

While I applaud your forgoing of the $60 million dollar payment I suspect having taken it would have only added to outrage and probably weakend your position in forthcoming lawsuits and don't feel that it was as self efacing as you have lead us to believe . Under your direction Enron has promoted bafoons, charletons and incompetents to the highest management ranks.  You personally did everything imaginable to lose the confidence of the investment community, in my opinion. This has got to be the financial disaster of the decade, all under your direction.

You said Jeff Skilling left for ""personal reasons"" and there were not hidden financial problems. You told us you were becoming more transparent in financial disclosures and then tried to slip a $1.2 Billion dollar equity reduction by us. The list goes on and on. Why should we believe you now.

One more thing Mr. Lay. I suggest  take the listing of  ""executive awards"" off the internet site. I suspect new ""awards"" will be coming out soon. And please don't waste your time sending me self serving ""feel good"" memos anymore. I finally caught on to you.

Subject:	Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

"To Chuy's defenders","Dear OfficeName1234,

It is definitely working.  The world is being made aware of Chuy's  actions
and the Dems are lining up to eat that crap Chuy's calls tex-mex.

Talk about poetic justice.  May you all gag on a giant hairball.

Just who is it that ever complained about the Clinton or Gore kids? They got
a pass on everything, even when little Al was thrown out of school for his
drug abuse. That Chuy's grease  has clogged your mind,

Isn't it funny that the same people who would have been screaming the
loudest
about the ""immorality"" of Bill and Hilary Clinton had their daughter,
Chelsea, been cited for underage drinking  are the same people who now find
the treatment of the Bush family so ""outrageous?""  I can't stand Chuy''s

offset the amazing level of hypocrisy I have seen in the several e-mails I

"thank you","Mr. Lay,

We have not met, but I want to thank you for the letter you sent to all
employees re: Sept. 11.

I am a still-new employee (1+ years) of Portland General Electric (a
wholly owned electric utility subsidiary :-), but I want to tell you
how proud I am of being a member of a team so dedicated to doing its
best at all times -- even in the absolute worst of times, as we've
experienced in the last month.

I only hope that if PGE must leave the Enron family, we will be able to
maintain the same high level of respect and integrity we've achieved to
date. I am proud to be an Enron/PGE employee.

Hello.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"Real Estate Investment - Shawn Gross","
I wanted to inform you of an investment opportunity with Shawn Gross.   
 
He planning on developing a 2.5-acre tract at the corner of Kirby &  Braeswood.  This location as you know is close to the medical center area  and surrounded quality old neighborhoods.  Two apartments in the area have  been very successful.  The Providence across the street is getting rental  rates in the $1.22 per square foot and Kirby Place, an older apartment complex,  is getting $1.13 per square foot.
 
The preliminary plan is to develop three or four story structures with a  total of approximately 110 or 150 units, respectively.  The total  project cost are projected to be $8.1 million or $10.9 million.  Capital  required for this development is between $1.6 million (for the three story  development) and $2.2 million (for the four story development).  An  additional call later on during development could be around $200,000 due to  increasing costs (i.e, increase in lumber prices).  The property would  probably be completed 18 months out.  Projected IRRs are between 20% to 28%  depending on the sale of the property.  Return on Cash Invested starts at  approximately 11% in 2002 and increases steadily up 20% around 2006.   Assumptions are: $1.22 per square foot rents; revenues & expenditures rising  3.5%; vacancy loss of 5%; Cap Rate of 8.5%; total project cost between $8.1  million and $10.9 million, depending on three or four stories.  There is an  issue with the property being in the 100-Year Floodplain, but he is proposing to  alleviate the problem by creating a water feature on the property and raise the  grade of builderable area above the Floodplane.
 
I spoke to Jenard about the project before I've been able to discuss it  further with Shawn.  I asked him about some of the assumptions, such  as the rental rates and cap rates which I thought where a bit aggressive.   He told me to the contrary, that Shawn's other project is pulling in  similar rates, as well as other non-Shawn projects.  With regards to the  cap rate, he said that he has been seeing 8%, which would call for a greater  sales price than the assumed 8.5% (I can discuss this in further detail for  anyone who doesn't understand cap rates).  Jenard is investing 15% of  the capital required as a limited partner (same terms as the rest of the  partners) and Shawn is investing 5% (4% as a limited partner, 1% as GP).   Shawn will be the developer, JMG Builders will be doing the construction, and  JMG Managers, Ltd. will be managing the property.  In otherwords, Dad will  have his construction company and management company doing the project.   Shawn will be the developer.  While the property is under operation there  should be distributions (not treated as capital returned).  At the time of  sale, mortgage refinance, or other capital event, after all debts have been  repaid, all of the partners will get their capital contribution back.   Then, profits are distributed.  I can go through the partnership structure  for those who are interested, which includes distributions and fees.   
 
I am considering investing in 1% to 2% of the deal.  A 1% percent  investment amounts to either $16,000 or $22,000 invested, depending on the three  or four story scenario, plus the possible additonal cash call of $2,000.   There are several risks (i.e., softening of rental rates) which dooesn't make  the returns a guarantee.  However, I feel good about the Houston  economy and absorption rates in the residental (and commercial) markets for  Houston.  Feedback from Jenard regarding his developments in  Houston and Steve Keller's South Rice Apartment development have all been  extremely positive.  Shawn's personal developments include:  one in  Houston completed and doing great;  the other Houston project never got  developed because someone offered him so much money on the land, he and his  partners had to take it (not a bad problem considering it took the risk out of  developing and returned an enormous IRR to the investors).  Although he has  not developed much, his father is an investor and will have some  involvement.  Money invested would be tied-up for at least two years  (unless something happens like his last project), but up until a sale which  could take between 2 to 5 years (or longer) there could be distributions.   That assumes that the project is doing well.
 
Anyway, please let me know if any of you are interested.  The deal  is scheduled to fund June 10.  Like I said, I have not heard from him  on all the specifics.  Therefore, I don't know at this time how much is of  the deal is even available.  I would be glad to discuss this in greater  detail with any of you that are interested.
 
- Beau

"Please Register to Attend the Enron Management Conference","As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

"Update to share","
Family and Friends,
I just received this e-mail from a  girlfriend of mine and wanted to share her first hand accounts with you.   It put a lump in my throat and brought tears to my eyes.  I ache for those  people, all people, our nation and our world.  May God bless you, and  may you feel blessed each and every day by his presence!   
Love,
Robyn

Subject: Update
Hi,
First, let me thank you again  for your thoughts and concerns.  
I did make it out of the city for a  long weekend and truly got to unwind.  Many people out in the Hamptons are  contributing to the cause in several ways and like the rest of the country the  mood is somber. However, life is still beautiful there.  I rode my bicycle  everyday, canoed, walked on the beach and went to interesting dinners.  But  then I came back.  The bus I was on was stopped and searched before  entering the Midtown tunnel, which leads into the city.   Everyone,  including the driver was asked for picture ID.  I came back because Monday  evening started the Jewish New Year and I had dinner with my family in the city.   After dinner, my brother-in-law, my cousin (visiting from Israel) and I  went downtown to ground zero.  It is off limits to anyone other than the  military, firefighters and the police, but I got this unique opportunity to  enter the belly of the beast because my friend who has a restaurant down in  Tribeca set up a hot meal zone in one of the damaged buildings.  He and his  staff are the only non officials allowed there.  I went to help serve.   Getting down was a struggle in itself.  I passed through many  blockades guarded by the military, and finally had a police escort get me all  the way down.  No matter how I describe what I saw, I couldn't possibly  give an accurate picture of the devastation.  The only thing I can tell you  is that it is so much larger in life.  The piece of facade of one of the  towers that you have seen on the news and in all the papers spans one full city  block.  There were firefighting crews from California, Ohio, Indiana and  more.  I spoke with many. 
Yesterday I went to synagogue.  The  experience was intense.  We waited on a line that went around the block  before going through metal detectors to get in.  I sat next to a Managing  Director of Cantor Fitzgerald, who was late to work on Tuesday.  He lost  all 200 of his staff as well as 500 who did not work directly for him.  The  woman in front of me lost her son.  We had several firefighters visit the  temple and, as you can imagine, they walked into a full five minutes of cheers  and applause.  It was so touching.  No dry eyes.
I realize I'm  rambling but thought you might be interested in a first hand account.
All  my best to you,
Joyce

"Thank You, Mr. Lay","Mr. Lay, 

For the past 13 days, I have been on a medical mission trip to Honduras (five of which weren't
scheduled, but were necessary because Continental canceled flights in light of our nation's
tragedy).

Although Honduras is a third world country and very little American news makes it there, I was
told that Enron had donated 1 million dollars to the Red Cross and was matching employee donations 
2 to 1 in response to the terrorist attacks on our Country. Mr. Lay, it made me even more proud 
to work for this company, and to work for you.

I can't tell you what an honor it is to work for this company and for you (you hear countless stories
of what you and Enron have done for our community).

Sincerely,

Josh Duncan

Subject: Retention Bonuses


Reading all of the media reports on the $58 million of payments .  All of the reports I have read refer to ""executives"" receiving payments. I think we need to be very clear that NO executives received payments (at least this is how I understand it).  I am refering to executives as 16b officers.  This will not only clarify the situation for the media, but will help with severed employees as well.

Ken,
 
Here are a few items that should be addressed  and/or corrected.
 
1.    A recent caller on a Houston  talk radio show stated that you personally own, not just one, but several  jet aircraft and travel in them on a regular  basis.
 
2.    The Houston Chronicle stated  that you spent time in Aspen between Christmas and the New Year.
 
3.    People in the media  are asking, ""Why is Ken not attending the upcoming employee  meeting?""
 
I'll forward anything else I hear or read  immediately.
 
Love,
 
David.

"Thanks Ken","Ken:

I think this is very honorable for you to take the position of not accepting
your severance.  That would be hard for anyone else to turn down.

My hat's off to you!

Having retired from Enron, we can use any help from you possible to preserve
the retiree benefits in the new Dynegy, Inc. organization.  If you have any
influence over Dynegy, Inc. Please ask them to keep the Inactive Employee
(Retiree) Medical provisions.

My wife, Brenda, still has fond memories of meeting you. She was in the RED
wheelchair at our last meeting.

Thanks and good luck in your future and we always enjoyed receiving your
family Christmas card and picture,


Dennis & Brenda Alexander

"Rebuild","Dear Ken:

I am very sad to see what has happened to such a big icon in Houston.  I am very sorry to see you struggle through this and try to remain at a high level.  I am very pleased to see you chose to stay with the company and work at what I hope is its new birth and positive rise in society and business community.

I had a chance to meet with you a little over a year ago at a charity function.  While I am no expert in the energy business and I'm but a college student at the present time, I would like to share a view from the other side of the inner loop your used to.  Before I met you everyone I spoke with had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and what a genious you are.  After the news came out about the misfortune of Enron, some of those same people started bad mouthing some of the same people they praised.  It made me sick and made me think very little of those individuals.  I was concerned because I could not believe that you would intentionally and knowingly do something that would jeopardize the very company you helped build.  The day I saw you make the decision to not leave or step down as CEO I knew then that you must not have been directly involved in the coverup done by your previous COO and a couple of other top executives you had entrusted.  Those few people, on!
e of which you had recently hired, all quit just before the news came out about Enron bookkeeping.

I feel safe in saying you must have been misadvised by those few people or you did not know what they were doing behind your back.  It is obvious they were not working for Enron like you, but rather ""at"" Enron to try to steal as much money and benefites they could and then head for the hills, which is what they did.  The mere act of having several top executives quit working at Enron after a short stay at the company and then cashing out on their holdings tells me it was intentional and I consider them thieves.  It would be a different story had they stayed like you and really cared about the company and what it represents and does for society as a whole.

I feel very sorry for those investors and employees who have been devestated by what has happened. BUT, it makes me very angry to hear people and writers casting stones on you and a company that has done so much over the past several years for so many.  Enron has funded more charity events and backed more functions and elections than most.  Now when the tide has turned and (due to a few greedy top executive decisions) Enron is in the position of needing help, everyone is out for blood and looking to end a company that still represent the same work it did before, but whose value has decreased because of word of mouth and the stupid greed of your previous employees.

Some people I have talked with say Enron is finished and is only a matter of time before it is gone.  That makes me angry too.  From what I see you have not given up on the company nor have you abandoned ship.  That tells me you may be trying to rebuild the company and its reputation.  That would be the greatest thing to do and show those who are out for Enrons demise (and who can do nothing but bad mouth) just what your really made of and put them in their place.  I have been reading nothing but negative articles about the company.  I feel like it is not the company, because that would mean every single employee would be to blame.  Rather the writers should focus on the few individuals who cashed out and split.

I would hope you could remember back 4 or 5 years ago when the company was really thriving and doing well.  I hope you can remember the good things about the company and the fact that it can still (and does) make money from its businesses.  It can turn around if you want it to.  I would hope you can make the trading business and other companies held by Enron what it once was without having to sell off too many of the future profitable ones and make use of the two beutiful buildings now towering over Houston's skyline.  I call those Houston's twin towers.

Other large companies in the past have turned around after similar set backs as horrible as this with Enron.  Your turn around would be record setting.  I heard about others (like the teachers retirement fund) making noise about wanting to take Enron to court because they invested millions.  That is stupid because it is their choice to invest and their risk to take, especially making it after the news broke about the company.  Sure they trusted that Dynegy would merge, so perhaps their frustration should be aimed at Dynegy or perhaps use their collective educated minds together to help find a way to turn Enron around and make their investment purposful rather than throwing stones.

I think Dynegy is a wonderful company as well, but it ""was mean"" for them to come out and say ""yes they would merge"" and then not.  I realize it's all business and people like to make money, but it's another thing to flat steal and lie (like your executives you trusted did) rather than profit from hard work and honesty.

I personally know of many large corporations and politicians who have things to hide that would cause problems like yours.  Your company is not alone, which is why I am so angry at others throwing stones at you and Enron.  This would not happen if there were'nt executives in corporate industries like the ones you entrusted your company to who try to take rather than give and earn from it.  Perhaps many should learn from Colleen Barrett, COO of Southwest Airlines.  Do you know that they are the only airlines to refuse federal aid recently and they are doing better then most airlines.

Good luck and thank you for hanging in there and making me believe there are still some good top CEO's out there.

Dabhol and the do nothing Government

By Prem Shankar Jha

Ever since the Vajpayee's Government came to power more than two
and a half years ago, the economy has been sliding relentlessly
into the deepest recession it has ever known. In the nine months
since December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. The
decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only five
years ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distant
memory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11
terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -
vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV
sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With no
demand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer price
index, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead and
there is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sector
is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human
memory.

In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to
find a place, however humble, in the organised sector of the
economy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risen
by another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confident
that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of
the country's problems.

But one recent event highlights the government's paralysis more
sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is its
failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the
Maharashtra State Electricity Boards's attempt to foil Enron's
bid to take it before an international arbitration court by
claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court
challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase
agreement.

The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government's
international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the
agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,
proceedings in an international court must take precedence over
those in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been cleared
for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an
international tribunal for a breach of it contractual
obligations.

Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron's lawyers, both those
whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase
agreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB
will lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservative
estimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs and
damages. In addition it will have to spend a little more to
complete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project is
likely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.
For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has
dragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was
simply a dispute between a State Government and a private
company, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in any
case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-
guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. But
today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because
neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,
let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the bill
will, inevitably land at the Centre's door. And that means the
taxpayer's door.

The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,
will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? The
answer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do is
transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete
and operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion power
plant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too will
insist on the capital value of the project being substantially
written down first. Judging from the offers that the Tata
Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply
Company (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value will
not exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, the
country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3
billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for that
matter anything else) in return.

None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron
probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao
government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor is
it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that
had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more
particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning
the latter's inability under law to pay backup charges at more
than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants
would have been exposed long ago.

But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify
even greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, the
Enron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As a
serious, responsible government that knows the importance of
honouring one's word in a world where contract is king, the
Vajpayee Government must honour the country's contractual
obligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying to
alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not
see, but by definition all future changes must be by mutual
consent.

The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol's power
affordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee
and the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buy
the $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a
separate company that can supply gas to all the current and
future users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one better
and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage
the plant. This is entirely feasible because its installed
capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. This
will bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges and
cost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.

Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the
equity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the
1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.
This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign
exchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicing
represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.

The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman
of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee
debt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity
tariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oil
having fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changes
will bring down the cost of Dabhol's power at 90 per cent
capacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will make
it entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and the
neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the
average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and
reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.

The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be
to take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it with
Enron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from it
at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before
handing it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court will
neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol's power nor answer
the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new
power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it
charges for electricity.

"San Antonio Offsite - Communication","Dear Dr. Ken Lay -

	It was my pleasure to meet you during the WCS cermony in New York earlier this year during which Enron received the award for the work we have done in Bolivia with the WCS and other NGOs.  During a staff call today in my group the rumor of the potential cancellation of the offsite in San Antonio was mentioned.  Hopefully this rumor is nothing more than that - a rumor.  During the time of crises the transmittal of information is critical.  Furthermore having the Enron management at the VP and above level bought into the way forward for the company is a must for the continued success of the company.

"Apology","Dr. Lay,

I just wanted to write to apologize on behalf of whomever sent you those hostile questions.  Even though we have some reasons to be angry, we do not have 
an excuse to be rude or disrespectful, specially to you.  I wanted you to know that those acts do not reflect the sentiments of the majority of Enron Employees. We are embarrassed that you even had to address the question on the first place.  Please accept this apology and we hope to have you around for a long time, your words of encouragement really makes a difference, thank you.

Although Harmolyn and I have wanted to pass on some words of friendship for some time, we did not want to intrude for even a moment as you worked to deal with your problems. 
We could not, however, let the holiday season past without saying that you know where we are and how to reach us. And I think you know that we are fully ready to help in any way we can in the weeks and months ahead. 
You will be interested in knowing that Brudder Pete called me on my 78th (Christmas eve) and he sounded twenty years younger than when I saw him in September.

"Follow-up/Next Steps","Ken,

Let me expand on some of issues we covered in Houston earlier this week.
Some of this is outside my purview, but want you to have the benefit of my
objective, outside, reasonably well-informed perspective.     Please call
to discuss any of this at any time.

1.)  	Establish your own internal advisory group to plan/coordinate all
company actions during this period.   Meet/call with full group at end of
each day to assess develoments, adjust strategies, set next day's actions.
  In my view, that group should include:

Bowen, Derrick, Delainey, Frevert, McMahon, Tilney.   (I am happy to
participate at any time.)

2.)	I'd assign specific tasks to this core group and other senior execs.
as follows:

	Bowen:  new IR point person.  Have him visit and re-visit sell-side
analysts, provide update on status of core business, financing, promise
ongoing communications, full disclosure, renewed commitment to candor,
clarity.     (I can help prepare/advise him on this new role.)

	Derrick: monitor SEC investigation, shareholder suits etc.  Keep tight
leash on MacLusas and Wilmer Cutler.   Engage outside lawyers in
discussion of SEC leak strategy, endgame and public relations
implications.  (I have considerable experience in this space and would be
happy to talk/work with Derrick to insure that the public face of this SEC
investigation is seriously evaluated as part of Enron's SEC strategy.)

	Delainey:  have him spend his time meeting, calling, talking with
wholesale and retail customers.  Quite similar presentation to that Bowen
delivers to the Street.  Humility, candor, commitment to continue serving
customers should be core thematics.

	Frevert:    have him devote his time to calling on, talking with
international customers with similar messages to those delivered by
Delainey.   Also have him take charge of wholesale review/potential revamp
of Enron's performance review/comp programs.   (This is where Herb
Allison, Merrill's former COO, could be helpful.)

	McMahon:    he's your point person with lenders, ratings agencies.  I'd
also have him work with Tilney to construct the clearest case statement
possible explaining Enron's
strategy for is core businesses and why they are so compelling.
Suggestion:   Irwin Stelzer is the single best writer who can simplify
complex issues that I know.   He' s offered to help.  I encourage you to
have him see whomever he needs to see and then write the Enron business
strategy story.    He'd also be a great spokesperson and advocate with
Wall Street.   Might be worthwhile having Bowen take Irwin to a few key
meetings with sell-side analysts.  I think Irwin would be a huge asset in
that role.

	Tilney:	    have Beth make sure that every communication from Enron,
internally and externally, is clear, concise, candid and responsive to
each audience's needs and expectations.   She should manage Mark Palmer
and his staff, Kekst people and any other communications resources
(internal and external) that should be brought to bear druing this period.

	Whalley:   have him spend all his time with your traders and those among
counterparties with whom he is a critical factor.   I'd keep him away from
the Street and from the media.

	Kean:	   have him focus solely on regulatory and legislative audiences.
He should personally work federal and state regulators, Capitol Hill
(members and staff)
and present updated presentation about the company's business, status of
financials,
status of internal reviews and SEC investigation.    I do think Steve's
core presentation should be vetted carefully by Derrick, McMahon and
Tilney before he goes on the road.

	Palmer:    I'd leave it to Tilney as to whether Mark should continue as
principal spokesperson for Enron.  Don't know if Tilney's right, but I do
think you need a new face and voice to the media.

	Koenig:     I'd pull him back, have him work under Bowen to craft/refine
presentations to the Street (in close coordination with MacMahon and
Tilney).  As we discussed, I think Koenig is damaged goods on the Street
right now.

	Lay:	 I think you should  act as the general who sets strategy, deploys
your senior human assets and motivates your troops.   I think you should
orchestrate every strategic action of the company,  talk regularly to
employees, selectively call on strategic customers,  and reassure the
world that Enron touches that you are ""in charge,""  ""hands on,"" and doing
""everything possible"" to guide this damaged ship into safer waters.

3.)	Encourage the board Special Committee to prepare an Executive Summary
of its report to you and the board that is entirely suitable for public
consumption.  (I would be happy to help craft and edit that document.)
Assuming the report fundamentally exonerates the company, this is a
critically important document.  You must assume that this report will
become public eventually.  It is be prepared and submitted with that
clearly in mind.

4.)	Retain a second investment bank to augment Goldman.   My suggestions:
talk with Jeff Holzschuh at Morgan Stanley or Bruce Wasserstein at Dresner
Kleinwort Wasserstein.  Lehman's top energy people are gone and I think
Rick Gordon/Merrill is seen as too close to you.

I've gone on too long.  Let me know how I can be specifically helpful to
you and/or your colleagues.   I'll stay in touch via voicemail or e-mail
if and as I have specific tactical suggestions.     I've available to you
or your colleagues  at any time.

"Finalizing the Management Conference agenda","
I'm putting the finishing touches on the agenda for the Management Conference.  With General Norman Schwarzkopf and Gary Hamel scheduled to speak, this year's program is superb.  

Currently, there is time on the agenda to include two 30 minute business unit presentations or another outside speaker.  Since we already have four external speakers and last year's feedback indicated an interest in hearing from internal leadership, I am proposing the business unit presentations -- specifically, Global Markets and Industrial Markets.  Please give me your feedback.  I will need to notify Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman, as well as Ray Bowen and Jeff McMahon very soon.

Mr. Lay and Dave Delainey:
 
Since, I was terminated from Enron Energy Service's on  Friday, November 16, 2001 before the Thanksgiving holiday and did  not received a check on November 30, 2001.    
 
Please advise when I will receive my vacation owe to me of  73 hours, and when I will receive my severance?   Especially  since I was terminated from my job before Enron  officially declared bankruptcy.   
 
Ashley Kerr, HR Specialist replied via  email stating that;  Per the HR Service Connection the process of paying vacation out  30 days later is to ensure that any outstanding balances owed by the employee  can be taken care of (for i.e. - any Energizer charges you have in November will  be taken out of you vacation on 12/15.)  
 
But it was not  what Ms Kerr, HR Specialist outlined in her handwriting the day I  was terminated on November 16, 2001.  She explained and outlined the dates of what amount I would  be receiving on the payroll of November 30, 2001, December 15,   December 31, 2001 and on January 31, 2001.
 
Didn't you all received a check  on November 30th?  I hope that  Fastow and Skilling didn't received any kind of payment on November  30, 2001 from Enron's payroll.  
 
I await for your response, so that I may take care  of my bills.
 
Thanks,

"","Mr Lay,

I just wanted to thank you for cutting your financial support for Enron
Europe.

I am pleased to say that, as from today, I am no longer employed. I will be
explaining this to my three children tonight. I hope they will understand
why Santa won't be coming to my house this year. Still that may be easier to
explain than why we do not have a house anymore.

Please pass on my deepest thanks to the other senior managers that have
brought this company (not Corp) to it's knees.

May I also soy that I am very impressed by the level of management
throughout the last few weeks. A world class team indeed.

If you see fit, I will be happy to accept a personal cheque for the ?20,000
Enron owes me.

Yours sincerely,

A faithful employee.

"PGE/NWN Purchase and Sale Agreement","I spoke with Dick Reiten today about when he could expect Enron to take the PGE/NWN deal to the creditor committee for approval.  Dick says by next week he will have his financing lined up with the lenders only having outs if there is a substantial change in the economics of the deal due to regulatory action.  He expects Oregon PUC approval in late May.  He believes that he needs approval from the creditors committee by early February.  He stated that his team is getting questioned  on the timing of the creditor committee approval.  He was pretty insistent that early February should be plenty of time to get approval on a deal of this magnitude.

I told Dick the the Creditor Committee had a mountain of work to do and thought everyone involved needed to understand the complexities of the bankruptcy process before such a large deal was put before the Creditor Committee.  He recognized that but stated the DIP banks were also asking his people about the sales process and timing and thought they would want affirmation that the deal was getting Creditor Committee approval.

I told Dick that we would try to move the process along and thought early to mid February was the quickest we could hope to get Creditor Committee approval.  (This was based on our conversation in Jeff's office that we would know betterabout the timing in 4 to 6 weeks.

Dick plans on us talking weekly about the the progress.  As you can see he is thinks it very important to move this forward as quickly as possible.

"Update on Disaster Relief Board","Dear Colleagues,
     We met with the Mayor and his staff today, and agreed that in
light of the terrorist attacks in New York  we need to redouble our
efforts in Houston. As the
President said last night,"" Be ready"". Ed Djerejian has offered to hold
a  meeting at the Baker Instiute next Friday at 2pm. Please try to
attend. His office will send
more info. I will update the acceptances on the membership list  by
Tuesday.  So far  around  40 replies, all yes. I  believe these  ad
hoc  groups have a  short life-
span, deservedly so, but for now we  can help by prodding the many
agencies  into better  communication and coordination, and a mobilized
citizens    group
increases the chances of federal  funding for  Houston. The website
itself may  end up as the education and     communication  tool of
choice in a disaster:

Cindy, I sent this to Jeff McMahon today.  I wanted you to see it.  You can forward it to Ken if you'd like - I am very interested in speaking with him as soon as that can be arranged.  I very much appreciate your insightful and professional support of me in all of this from day one!  Thanks, Sherron.

Subject:	Your new CFO spot and the job I want

Jeff, Congratulations, you deserve the job and can do it superbly!  You know you will need to replace Ben Gilson as Treasurer - possibly with Bill Brown.  

My issue, and I feel very strongly about this, is that I want to be on the crisis management team to determine how we save our trading franchise.  It can disappear over night and I believe there's more bad news coming re: these raptor deals (ie, restatement).  I have clearly proven myself to be the only person at Enron that had the character, at great risk to my own career, much less personal risk, to go to Ken Lay and let him know what was going on here.  I resent all these late comers joining the band wagon - it's damn easy to make a statement now, when Ken has made the hard decision to unwind these deals and write them off.  Mainly I resent being stuffed into a holding tank, I should not be the pariah here!  Despite your comment to me several weeks ago when I told you that's how I felt and you replied ""what did you expect?""  I have been professional in this 100%, I went to Ken and Ken alone, in contrast to yesterday's VP Jim S. who put Ken on the spot by asking unanswerable questions at the all employee meeting. I hope to meet with Ken Lay soon.  But I'd like to talk to you about my role in the 'inner circle', because I firmly believe I deserve it and have proven so by my past evaluations of the negative impact of these structures and then by my actions in doing something about it.  You can help me with your endorsement of me to Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and Ken Lay.  I hope I have it.  Thanks and good luck in the new job, Sherron

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"corporate responsibility","Mr Lay,
To suggest that I am merely disappointed by Enron's
performance in both the public markets and the broader
corporate universe is an understatement.

Enron is at a crossroads with one path leading to
irrelevance assigned to companies unable to rise in
the face of crisis, and the other path being reserved
for those that not only survive, but come out
stronger. I'm sure you can easily identify examples of
each without my help.

Every individual in management and oversight (the
Board of Directors) shares the blame and
responsibility to take drastic action and come clean.
Enron now has a higher bar of corporate governance
than other publicly traded companies due to the
reckless squandering of trust that resulted from
actions of many individuals who believed they were
clever and crafty, or just plain greedy. Furthermore,
I strongly suggest to you that many senior managers
within the corporate suites of Enron no longer have a
place in the company, quite possibly that may include
yourself. A clean break and a thorough cleaning is
clearly required.

In years past, when asked about the companies that I
admired and watched, Enron always was on the short
list. Sadly, I can no longer say that.

Jeff Nolan, an Enron shareholder

"Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process","The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

"Yale Dinner for William McDonough, November 27, 2001","Dear Ken,

As promised, here is some background for our off-the-record dinner
discussion on November 27 that the Yale School of Management is having to
honor Bill McDonough.

The evening will begin with my presenting Yale's award to Bill McDonough.
Bill will then make some personal remarks about the state of globalization
as he sees it. Gordon Brown will then respond. Following that, John Browne
will lead a discussion among all of us based on a question along these
lines:

""The world faces recession, terrorism, and large gaps between rich and poor
-- to cite just a few of the problems. To what extent is more globalization
the solution and to what extent is it the problem? (You may wish to refer to
such areas as finance, trade, energy, immigration. You could focus on more
liberalization or more regulation, or both.) Depending on your viewpoint on
the basic question, how do you see your own constructive role in
strengthening the global framework?""

We think this question will open up a wide range of intriguing insights.

Many thanks for thinking about it before the dinner.

For good order sake, here again are the logistics for the evening:

	National Portrait Gallery
	St Martin's Place
	London WC2H OHE
	Tel 44 207 312 2453 (Catherine Spoon)

"A SUGGESTION FOR POSSIBLE SURVIVAL","A SUGGESTION FOR POSSIBLE SURVIVAL

Dear Mr. Lay,

A suggestion that may keep the ""wolf from the door"".

The Enron corporate structure is already very compartmentalized,
with many separate companies defining the overall business structure.
My suggestion would be to take this concept even further.

Reorganize (before bankruptcy) and allow Enron Corp. to be only a
holding company with each of its current departmental companies
becoming independent ""profit center"" companies.  These new
corporations could negotiate independently with creditors, and even
authorize the exchanging of their equity for additional credit or
refinancing. (Private placements of equity, with a stated goal of
bringing these ""profit center"" companies public, should interest
creditors and investment banks.)

The creditors could get their assurances. Current stockholders keep
their investments in the holding company (with some perceived dilution);
And long-term, perhaps, Enron emerges as a mini conglomerate like Tyco.


Best wishes, May the Lord be with you and yours,

"Enron Community Forum event preparations","
Dear Mr. Lay:
 
I am responsible for preparing your briefing book for the first Enron Community Forum, to be held Oct. 3 and 4 in Pentagon City, Virginia. 
 
I am also responsible for preparing remarks that you are scheduled to make at two specific events at the Forum, namely the evening keynote address on Wednesday, 10/3, and the opening remarks at a luncheon on Thursday, 10/4.
 
The subject of the evening keynote address is ""Differing Visions of America's Energy Future.""  It is supposed to be followed by a dinner conversation with a panel of leading policy makers. 
 
The subject of the luncheon roundtable of ""Virtual Energy Markets: A Look Ahead."" On our program, there is a list of seven featured commentators who are supposed to get the attendees to discuss the topic, following your remarks.
 
I have some ideas and themes that you may wish to pursue on both of these subjects. But I am communicating with you to find out if there are particular matters you want to be addressed, and specific approaches to these issues that are best for your constituency in the audience.
 
I am working with Dennis Vegas and Margaret Allen in the public affairs group on this event, and will keep them informed of any developments. 
 
I look forward to hearing from you.  Please contact me if you have further questions.
 
Sincerely,

"Job Well Done","I wanted to recognize the employees at TAP and in Tracy Ramsey's organization for a job well done during the events of September 11th.  

TAP was instrumental in helping us determine which ENW employees were diverted or stranded on the ground.  The call volume during that time must have been enormous, yet we always got through and received the information we needed.

Tracy Ramsey and her staff deserve kudos for their tireless efforts to take care of stranded employees.  Tracy was personally responsible for arranging transportation for nine ENW employees stranded in Portland, including myself.  We arrived in Houston on Friday night, all grateful to be home.

Thanks again for a job well done.

"Employee Severance","December 27, 2001

RE: Employee Severance

Enron Corp.
Office of the Chairman
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002

Attention: Kenneth Lay

Enron has in place a severance policy that entitles
all terminated employees a benefit that is based on
length of service and amount of pay.

In the days leading up to the bankruptcy filing, then
again during floor meetings at the time of
termination, Enron representatives clearly stated that
the company would be seeking payment of the severance
policy for terminated employees.  This was to follow
the advanced payment of $4,500 for these benefits.

However, severed employees have not been contacted by
Human Resources representatives to advise them of the
amount of severance benefits they are eligible to
receive as stated in the policy.  They have also not
been informed of Enron's intention to pursue these
payments through the court.

Enron has since informed current employees that they
intend to work with the court to establish provisions
for additional retention and severance for current
employees.

Since these payments are crucial for severed employees
to assess their financial situation, we are asking
Enron to promptly respond to the following five
questions:

1) Will the Board approve the severance plan in place
or another plan of severance?

2) Will this be the same plan that is being put
together for current employees that may be severed at
a later date?

3) What day will the board be acting on this plan?

4) What day will the plan be presented to the
bankruptcy court?

5) Since employees have not been informed of the
status of their benefit, will application for state
unemployment benefits cease payment of the severance
benefit?  Will Enron waive that stipulation?

In the event that Enron will not be seeking additional
severance for terminated employees, we are asking that
Enron answer the following questions:

1) By what day will a Human Resources representatives
contact each employee with the amount of severance
they were eligible to receive at the time of their
termination?

2) How do employees access supporting documentation
needed for filing a proof of claim form through the
bankruptcy court?  This would include company policy
manuals and employee files.


Respectfully,


Ezzatollah (Ezzy) Sadrerafi

Norman Ornstein, American Enterprise Institute
Panelists:
Rep. Brian Baird, U.S. House of Representatives (D-Wash.)
Rep. Doug Bereuter, U.S. House of Representatives (R-Nebr.) invited

What if the terrorists had succeeded in flying an airplane into the Capitol, killing or incapacitating many members of the House of Representatives and the Senate? Our Constitution and laws have only makeshift and incomplete provisions for Congress to convene, do business, and make laws under those circumstances. This is no academic problem:  among the last things the United States needs in the aftermath of a terrorist attack is the enduring absence of national leadership. At this event a panel will discuss the security and constitutional issues surrounding a deadly attack on Congress.  Norman J. Ornstein will discuss issues raised in his recent pieces on the subject in Roll Call (http://www.rollcall.com/pages/columns/ornstein/) and the Washington Post. Congressman Brian Baird will present his recently introduced constitutional amendment to allow Congress to function under such an emergency.

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
September 2001, Number 21

THE EVER-CHANGING U.S.-MEXICO RELATIONSHIP
Sidney Weintraub

I have written extensively on U.S.-Mexican relations during the past several decades, perhaps more than on any other theme. I have a daughter who was born in Mexico and feel warmly toward the country. My research, visits, conversations, and analysis provide many insights-even if imperfect knowledge. Examination of this relationship became a national pastime last week when President Vicente Fox made a highly publicized state visit to the United States.

The overused clich? was that the United States had a love/hate attitude toward Mexico. This is too strong; the emotions never ran that deep. The duality of feeling was more like hope/disdain-a wish that Mexico would deal with its deep economic, social, and political problems, and at the same time an attitude of condescension that Mexico never seemed to accomplish this. The Mexican duality toward the United States was something on the order of ambiguity/mistrust-should we embrace the United States or keep our distance out of wariness that Mexico might be betrayed at crucial moments?

Fox, in his speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on September 6, said that the moment of change, particularly for Mexico, was when NAFTA came into existence, at the beginning of 1994. I agree with this judgment. NAFTA was the most profound agreement between the two countries in the twentieth century. NAFTA, in my view, used trade and investment as the route to long-term political embrace; and the extent to which this will go will be unknown for perhaps 50 years. I must confess that I had little sympathy with the NAFTA naysayers in either country because I felt that they lacked a sense of what neighborly relations could be-but instead focused on their particular interests or foibles, and not on how two countries thrown together by fate could and should handle their neighborly destinies. The obscenity of a rich United States coexisting with a poor neighbor is unhealthy for both, because it spawns such problems as undocumented migration, and is perpetually destabilizing.

The U.S. reception of Fox was remarkably warm. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) brought NAFTA into existence, but it was Fox's victory in the July 2, 2000, presidential contest that alerted the U.S. audience that our neighbor to the south was transforming itself into a democracy. A troubled neighbor, an important economic partner, and a country that had shed much of its political authoritarianism-Fox embodied all these attributes.

Yet, considerable condescension toward Mexico remains in the U.S. body politic, as it does in popular sentiment. The congressional vote to prohibit Mexican trucks from crossing the border to deliver goods throughout the United States-despite a commitment to do so in an agreement approved by Congress-was an illustration of this. Domestic politics was more important to the U.S. Congress than the Mexican relationship, more important than keeping the U.S. word. If, instead of Mexico, this had been a disagreement with Canada, or the United Kingdom, or Germany, would Congress have acted as it did? I doubt it. Will Congress give up its insistence on certifying Mexico's behavior in the fight against drug use? It has not until now, despite the evident futility and resentment caused by this practice. Maybe now it will. If so, chalk this up to Fox.

The central theme of Fox's speeches in the United States was ""trust."" Trust your neighbor, and he will return this sentiment. Punish your neighbor to force him to change his ways, and you will earn no trust in return-nor is he likely to change his ways. Fox is correct that this trust does not yet exist in full measure in either direction. The reason for this goes back to another clich? about the relationship-that it is asymmetric. Mexican analysts invoke asymmetry constantly. Economic asymmetry explains migration from Mexico to the United States; power asymmetry explains the fluctuating U.S. attention on Mexico; democratic asymmetry explains the differences in the administration of justice; historic asymmetry explains the mutual mistrust. One could continue endlessly; the asymmetry is real and it has consequences.

The United States is most comfortable in its relations with other developed countries, those that have reasonably comparable per capita incomes. Maybe some day Mexican incomes will approach those in the United States, but not for many years. The United States has close relationships with countries that share some of the burden of common defense. This is unlikely for Mexico. Achieving truly mature relations will require other accomplishments: more trade and investment; sustained economic growth in Mexico; a deepening of democracy; a reduction in Mexican corruption; an equitable system of justice; and an end to the need for Mexicans to emigrate, in violation of U.S. laws, to support themselves and their families. A superior/dependent situation does not permit a dialogue of equals.

The two countries' separate but intertwined histories have left a legacy of hangups on both sides. Historical experience explains much about Mexico's drive to retain its economic and political independence, and why it chose to remain distant from its powerful neighbor. This exercise in limited engagement was reciprocated in the United States; Mexico was seen as a troublesome neighbor, a poverty-ridden country that could not provide jobs for all of its people but instead had to rely on the escape valve of migration to the United States. It was not too many years ago (1996) that a best-seller was entitled Bordering on Chaos.

Fox did not initiate the changes taking place in Mexico. Many initiatives, in addition to NAFTA, preceded his election. Mexico had long had a policy of avoiding the discussion of migration issues with the United States, but then undertook a joint study of this subject under President Ernesto Zedillo that was published in 1998. The electoral laws that permitted Fox's election obviously had to be enacted beforehand. The conclusion that engagement with the United States was preferable to distancing it was made before Fox. Fox owes a deep debt of gratitude to Zedillo for relinquishing the leadership without a financial crisis, something that had eluded PRI presidents for some 30 years.
What the Mexican leadership concluded before Fox was that economic independence was a charade given the limited size of the Mexican domestic market and the inability in any event to escape the consequences of U.S. economic policies. I have long believed that the most important U.S. actions toward Mexico are taken without regard to their effects on Mexico-actions like raising and lowering the federal funds rate and managing the U.S. economy so as to achieve growth. It is the level of this growth that rejects or stimulates imports from Mexico. When NAFTA was negotiated the Mexican assessment was that national cultural identity need not be sacrificed in the pursuit of economic development. Indeed, without this development, a majority of Mexicans would have been excluded from the bulk of the nation's rich cultural offerings.

The United States responded positively to the Salinas proposal for free trade under the first President George Bush. Presidents Bill Clinton and now George W. Bush have pushed this engagement further. The laggard has been the U.S. Congress because of a variety of parochial interests, and an inability to shed long-ingrained habits of disrespect for Mexico.

Fox will not achieve all he seeks immediately-especially on U.S. immigration policy. Maybe never, but I doubt this. What his visit demonstrates is that he came to power at a propitious time, found a sympathetic ear in the person of the U.S. president, and has moved the negotiating agenda forward. This is not the end game-that must occur internally in each of the two countries-but it is a giant leap.

"Just a suggestion","Dear Ken,

I am a second year associate with RAC underwriting group. In the past few days, I have been watching fellow staff packing their personal items in an anticipation of a massive layoff while some have commence a lawsuit against the company (perhaps understandably).   I believe that we all owe it to you the leaders and the company to offer ideas and suggestions on how best to handle the situation no matter how stupid such ideas may sound.

The chance is that you have probably thought about and reject this idea, but I wonder how hopeless it will be to convince our creditors/debt holders to convert significant portion (if not all) of their debts holding to preferred equity (with option to convert to common). This no doubt will improve our credit rating, save us cash on interest payment, and give us room to borrow. Creditors can be offer a better conversion ratio which will be defensible even in the event of bankruptcy as long as they make some cash infusion at the same time.

I know that banks generally do not like the idea of equity investment, but given the present situation, that might not be a bad idea as long as it is in attempt to safeguard their investments.

I know it is a tough time and you have a lot of better things to do rather than reading emails, however, I will be pitching my ideas to you from time to time (as long as I'm around). 

I have absolute confidence in the ability of our leaders and I have no doubt that you all are doing your utmost best to improve the situation.

Best Regards,

Ola Oladeji
Associate (RAC Underwriting)

"Request for meeting -- Subject: short speech to US Olympic Commit	tee 7.16-19.01","Ken,

Houston's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games is entering the final phase of the
domestic bid process.  This summer, the United States Olympic Committee
(USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S.
bid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four.
This cut will occur in December of this year.  The USOC will be conducting
Houston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.

This site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic
Games to Houston.  Over the four-day period in which the USOC site
evaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and
presentations.  There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the
USOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where
we show why we think Houston can win on the international level.

As a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of
the team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team.  As
arguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and
as the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National
Convention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important
to the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's
international status.

George DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would
very much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on
Houston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the
upcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the
opportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the
number of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December
as a result of these meetings.  I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a
visit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with
you soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity
I've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on
the UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992
RNC Convention and later the GHP. Thank you for everything you've done for
Sarah and me -- hopefully I've reciprocated by doing a good job for you each
time.

All the best, Vidal

"Have Courage and Never be Afraid","My dearest precious men,

""Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all you who hope in
the Lord.""  - Psalm 31:24

Courage belongs to those who know God, says the psalmist.  And, I say we all
need to continually affirm God's power to protect us.  Today I have created
a litany which affirms our faith in God's power, so that we need never be
afraid.  Since our current situation strikes fear in our hearts, read this
litany of courage and praise.  You need never be afraid!

	When I am being tested beyond measure in my job responsibilities ...
		I will put my trust in God.
	When I am facing the greatest hurdles of my life...
		The Lord gives me courage!
	When I feel like I am completely alone...
		The Lord is my light and salvation!
	When I feel like the bottom is falling out...
		My heart shall know no fear!  God will save me!
	When I have no other answers or solutions...
		God will send the help I need!
	When I go through every terrifying minute of the day...
		I am expecting the Lord to rescue me!
	When I think failure is upon me...
		I am brave, for God's power is greater than any situation I could possibly
face today.


""FEAR NOT, FOR I HAVE REDEEMED YOU; I HAVE CALLED YOU BY YOUR NAME, KEN AND
BEAU, YOU ARE MINE.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE WATERS AND GREAT TROUBLE I WILL
BE WITH YOU.  WHEN YOU GO THROUGH RIVERS, THEY SHALL NOT OVERFLOW YOU.  WHEN
YOU WALK THROUGH THE FIRE YOU SHALL NOT BE BURNED, NOR THE FLAME SCORCH YOU.
FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, YOUR SAVIOR...YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY SIGHT, YOU
HAVE BEEN HONORED, AND I HAVE LOVED YOU.  FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU.""
Isaiah 43:1-5

The bottom line of our life should be faith, not fear, so live today
controlled by God-inspired positive thoughts!!!

Love and prayer, Linda/Mom

"Concerns With the Current Stock Price","
Hi Ken,

You have always told us that we can email at any time with comments or questions.

Employees are really getting worried about what's happened with our stock price.  It's not looking too good.  I know you and upper management are working hard to sort this out.  Please let us know what is really going on.  Rumors are flying about layoffs, bankruptcy, and takeovers.  All of our lives are affected.  People are trying to hang in here, but the future is too uncertain.  We are wondering whether to stay or bail out.

We need more answers.

Another comment which is constantly being made is that, ""It is not encouraging when we don't see upper management buying shares at these historically low prices"".   Any comments?

Thanks,

"Trust","Mr. Lay

We have had personal correspondence over the last 12 years or so and I have admired you for taking the time to write back to me even though I was just an employee and you were CEO.  

Even after all this stuff that is going on, I still believe that you are honest and trustworthy.  I don't understand all that has gone on and probably never will, I just know that after 17 years and being ""stupid"", I had all my retirement in Enron.  I am probably dumb again, but I just used some of my own money to buy Enron stock. I feel that the way to bring the stock back up is to invest and work harder. My father who has Enron stock that came from my deceased grandfather who retired as a NNG superintendent, has also just bought more stock.  We are trying and I know you are too.  

I know that you are going through a lot and I am praying for you and your family.

"University of Houston Law Center","Dear Mr. Lay,

I first wanted to thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail.  I know that you are extremely busy and receive numerous requests on a daily basis.

I have been an employee with Enron for almost two years.  I have spent most of my time on the Liquids trading floor as a Risk Manager for the financial crude book.  I was recently recruited by Fred Lagrasta to work in his midmarketing group.  I am responsible for supporting our originators in New York.  My years at Enron have taught me not only the business aspects of the energy industry, but to strive to pursue your dreams and accept nothing but the best from yourself.  

It has been a dream of mine to attend law school since I was little.  II feel like I am at the time in my life that I can sucessfully pursue this dream.  I am interested in studying corporate law at the University of Houston Law Center and participating in their part-time program while maintaining my employment with Enron. 

I recently spoke with Don Schroeder, a physical crude trader here at Enron, who suggested sending you an e-mail asking if you would be so kind as to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf.  I would be honored if you would write the university a letter recommending me to their part-time program.  I am hoping to make the early decision deadline of November 1st.  I understand that you do not know me at all, however I would be more than willing to come visit with you if you had time and/or forward you my resume and performance evaluations.  

I know that I would represent Enron well by attending the University of Houston.  I worked full-time throughout my college career at Texas A&M University to help finance my education.  I am a hard worker and take pride in everything that I do.  I know that I will be successful in law school as well as excel with my career at Enron.

Again, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read this request and your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely, 

Michelle Neson

>>WHAT IS HOWARD TALKING ABOUT TODAY?


>NBC4 Hosts Students in ""Reality TV"" Adventure
Eight Howard University School of Communications (HUSC) students will report
to WRC/NBC4
today with bags in tow, all a bit anxious about the challenges their 13-week
survival course holds for them.
Their bags, however, will be book bags and this is no game show.

The students are enrolled in ""Surviving Year One,"" a new course designed
exclusively for the School of
Communications by NBC4 Vice President of News and Operations Bob Long and
HUSC Faculty Lecturer
John Decker to foster the budding journalists' transition from the classroom
to the fast-paced realities of TV news.
Various NBC4 experts will teach one three-hour class weekly for the next 13
weeks, with topics ranging from
""newsroom dynamics"" to ""auditions and agents.""  ""Our students are extremely
sharp,"" says Dean Jannette L. Dates.
""This rare opportunity will make them even sharper.""

>Trustees Host Student Reception (01/17/02)
Howard University Undergraduate Trustee Breana Smith and Graduate Trustee

"","Dear Ken:

These are very difficult times for all of us, but I know that you and those who work closest with you are under unbelievable pressure at this time.  It's difficult for all of us, but you and your staff need to know that you have a great deal of support within the company.  Since I started with EDC in 1996, I have often felt that this is the best job that I ever had.  In good times and not-so-good times, the work has been interesting, challenging and even fun!  Now that you are ""back"" many of us are more confident of the future -- even at this time when things appear to be so bleak.

Enron has treated me very well in the past, and although we face an uncertain future, I will continue to support the company and especially you.   Your gestures toward the employees are much appreciated.    I have always admired your kind and  respectful attitude toward all who work for Enron, never more than now.   You have been our best representative and our best supporter, not to mention what you have done for the city of Houston.  No matter what happens, I will always feel privileged to have been a part of this organization.

Most sincerely,

"SUMMIT 2001 INVITATION","
Dear SUMMIT2001 Invitees and  Guests:
As individuals and as a nation, we have all been irrevocably  affected by the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  ALSTOM was fortunate  in that we did not lose any members of our immediate community (friends, family,  colleagues), and we sincerely hope that this is true for you and your community  as well.  To those of you that have suffered a loss, please accept our  deepest sympathies.
While it is hard at a time like this to think of  conducting business, we have paid heed to the words of President George W. Bush  when he encouraged us, as hard has it may be, to proceed with ""business as  usual.""  After careful consideration and no small amount of soul-searching,  we have decided to follow the advice of President Bush and move forward with the  SUMMIT2001 meeting in Las Vegas, October 7 - 9, 2001.
Helping us make  this decision have been many attendees, who have sent emails and made calls  encouraging us to proceed with SUMMIT2001.  As you know, we have put  together an agenda that includes an impressive list of speakers, each of whom  has reaffirmed his intention to participate.   For these reasons, we  made the decision to go ahead.  More than ever, it is time for us to  recognize the worldwide importance of our industry.    Through  this forum, we can and will take steps to ensure that we build a stronger  future-together.

"Our company's situation","Mr. Lay, as an employee about to enter his 18th year with Enron, I am deeply concerned about the situation our company is currently in.  Although I have every confidence that we will recover, could I respectfully ask that employees be given a daily update on what steps are being taken to reverse the trend that the company is in?  I realize that you and your team are diligently working to correct it, but I believe it would help morale if employees could hear on a more frequent basis specifically what our management is doing.  Anyone who monitors ENE on the stock market has been reading numerous negative articles and headlines, and it would be reassuring to know that there is some potentially positive news.
 
Thank you for listening.

FANNY BRICE HIT MUSICAL AT WORTHAM
JULY 10-22 AS 'BABY JANE' MOVES TO 2002

Theatre Under The Stars has rescheduled the World Premiere of ""What
Ever Happened to Baby Jane?""  into its 2002-03 season.  It will be
replaced by the TUTS premiere of ""FUNNY GIRL,"" the 1964 Broadway
smash-hit that made a star of a little-known Barbra Streisand.  The
dates of ""Funny Girl"" will be exactly the same as for ""Baby Jane, ""
July 10-22, at Wortham Center.  ""Funny Girl,"" which was later made
into a movie for which Streisand won an Academy Award, tells the story
of the legendary comedienne, Fanny Brice.  Star of saloons, burlesque,
vaudeville, movies, radio, and the Ziegfeld Follies, Brice had a
tumultuous relationship with the gambler Nicky Arnstein.  Their
star-crossed love story and Fanny's rise to stardom are the basis of
the musical.

With book by Isobel Lennart and a classic score by Jule
Styne and Bob Merrill, ""Funny Girl"" boasts such popular songs as
""People,"" ""Don't Rain On My Parade,"" and ""I'm the Greatest Star.""
Bruce Lumpkin, who recently staged TUTS' acclaimed ""Miss Saigon,"" will
direct and choreograph.

According to TUTS President/CEO Frank Young,
""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?""  is being delayed for six months
because of design problems.  ""A new work is always in the process of
development through many stages,"" said Young.  ""At any point in the
creative process, one or more elements may cause a delay.  The
creators and I firmly believe that a few more months of development
are needed to put the show into its final, audience-ready form.""


Single tickets for ""FUNNY GIRL"" are available on-line at
www.tuts.com/boxoffice/ticketing.htm using TUTS E-ticket system, by
phone at 800/678-4330, in person at either TUTS' box office, 2600
Southwest Freeway.

Production sponsors for ""FUNNY GIRL"" are the Humphreys Foundation,
El Paso Energy, Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Roberts, and Humana.

ATTENTION TUTS SUBSCRIBERS: You do not need to do anything.
Do not return your tickets.  Just show up at the theatre with your
""Baby Jane"" tickets on your performance date and time and you will be
seated for ""FUNNY GIRL.""  No new tickets will be issued.

'FUNNY GIRL' SOUVENIRS
AVAILABLE ON-LINE NOW

""FUNNY GIRL"" memorabilia, including tee-shirts, nightshirts,
songbooks, CDs and cassettes, are available now for purchase at
Theatre Under The Stars' on-line boutique.  Visit
www.tuts.com/shop.html for these and other musical theatre-related
items.

"NewCo"," Dear NewCo employees:
 
I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and next steps. 
 
What are those opportunities?  In short, to date no competitor has taken Enron's dominant market position.  In most cases, competitiors are retrenching from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to protect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets. Market liquidity and activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels.  This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less choices to manage key long-term risks. This lack of transparancy and liquidity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North American grid.   We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, which is unprecedented since the early nineties.  This coupled with market participants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many opportunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value. However, in the long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy and energy price volatility are highly likely. On the services side, there are numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron people have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible. I also believe that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to NewCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets. In short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has not been seen since the early nineties.
 
What is NewCo?  NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the energy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportunities detailed above.  These businesses will stretch from production to market, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in the United States and Canada. It will be a portfolio of several key businesses, services and assets supported by a common infrastructure.  It will be majority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensure liquidity and legitimacy. It will be re-branded and be operating and solvent by mid Q2 at the latest.  It will be seeded with a number of Enron assets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key credit support. Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately $500 million to one billion. With asset and new cash investment, NewCo should be at least a billion dollar company. It will emerge as a non-debtor company and should be an investment grade rated company. NewCo will employ approximately 100 to 200 people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under control.  These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in Enron and ex-employees. NewCo will have access to all Enron's existing systems and infrastructure. It will be in the market of buying and selling energy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the non-compete with Netco.I would expect that we would have a strong business and transactional relationship with Netco.
 
What will be NewCo's culture? It will have the benefits of being a small private company which will measure success by cashflow generation.  It will be a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other.  It will be a group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objectives.  It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily for long term value creation.  We will build an organization of integrity of which people can be proud. It will center its objectives around our customers and the satisfying un-met needs in the market.  NewCo will value customer relationships.  It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of open communication. NewCo will be innovative, agile and nimble.
 
What is next? There will be a meeting in 30C2 at 4:00 PM on Monday to discuss issues, questions and comments.  There will also be a dinner set up for 6:30PM on Tuesday at the Capital Grille to provide us an opportunity to spend additional social time to discuss NewCo. NewCo will be located on the 30th floor.  The immediate tasks in hand can be broken into the following: a) opportunity and business definiton including fully vetted business plans for opportunities identified around specific assets or independent of these assets; b) setting up infrastructure necessary to cure defaults and start performing to key operating assets including managing out of the bankruptcy; c) modelling cashflows, operating costs, capital requirements and proforma's for NewCo; d) working through the NewCo structure and path through bankruptcy to solvency, rating and operation; e) scouring Enron for other valuable assets not yet identified for NewCo; f) detailed market research;  g) asset acquisition target definition; h) financing and capitalization plan including raising external investment and i) additional hiring and recruitment.
 
On a final note, we will need to identify a new name for the company so let me know your ideas! I look forward to working with you towards reaching shared goals and celebrating the inevitable success.  
 
Respectfully,
Dave Delainey

3) New RFF Publications
Public Access to Environmental Information and Data Practice:
Examples from the United States, the European Union, and Central and
Eastern Europe
This reference manual provides a practical overview of how the United
States and European countries implement systems that grant the public
access to environmental information. The initial audience consists of
governments and stakeholders in Central European countries seeking to
develop their own systems (a requirement of the 1998 Aarhus Convention on
public participation in environmental decision making), but environmental
advocates in many other parts of the world will find the information
useful. The manual was developed jointly by researchers from Resources for
the Future, the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern
Europe, and the New York University School of Law, as part of a project
funded by the Global Environment Facility.

Discussion Papers:
RFF and Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology: Evaluating the StarLink
Corn Case

StarLink - a type of bioengineered corn that produces its own pesticide and
was approved only for animal feed - was found in the human food supply just
over a year ago, prompting massive recalls of corn-based products.
Resources for the Future, in cooperation with the Pew Initiative on Food
and Biotechnology, is in the process of identifying and analyzing the
regulatory and public policy issues raised by the StarLink episode.

State-Level Variation in Land-Trust Abundance: Could it Make Economic Sense?

Few economic analyses examine land trusts, their decisions, and the
land-trust ""industry,"" despite their growing importance. For example,
statistics on the wide variation in the number of trusts in different
regions of the United States raise questions about whether such variation
makes economic sense. This paper builds a model to identify the optimal
number of private conservation agents, and concluded that the number of
trusts is consistent with the optimal number of trusts that is predicted by
the model on the basis of the relative importance of spatial externalities
and organizational size in different regions.

An Economic Assessment of Space Solar Power as a Source of Electricity for
Space-Based Activities

Discusses the development of a conceptual model of the economic value of
space solar power (SSP) as a source of power to in-space activities, such
as spacecraft and space stations. Looks at the offering of several
estimates of the value based on interviews and published data, discuss
technological innovations that may compete with or be complementary to SSP,
and consider alternative institutional arrangements for government and the
private sector to provide SSP.

"Supply Corps Distinguished Alumni/Athens-Clarke County Power Plant","
Dear Mr Lay-
 
May I re-introduce myself. Several years ago we met  when you returned to the Navy Supply Corps School, Athens, Georgia to receive  your Distinguished Alumni Award and recognition. My name is Bob Gregory and I am  a retired Navy Supply Corps Captain, living in Athens. I am now the Vice  President of the Navy Supply Corps Foundation and also direct the  Distinguished Alumni Program. I do management consulting here in  Athens.
 
I have read Enron Corp. is considering building a  gas powered power plant here in Athens-Clarke County. From my understanding, the  plant is to be built in an industrially zoned park. I believe the plant would be  a natural for the area. The project appears to be moving though the  county's planning bueracracy, however I note some of the votes have been close.  As you can see in the attached article, the environmental folks are starting to  raise their heads in protest. 
 
I personally believe the plant is a great  project and favor it enthusiastically. To me, it is a ""no brainer"". I do  believe, however, Enron could make a public relations ""coup de tat"". The  idea of a member of the Navy Supply Corps School's Distinguished  Alumni  deciding to build a major new plant here in Athens, Georgia,  could bring a lot of good press for both the plant and Enron, Inc in  particular.
 
I would be pleased to assist the Enron effort and  help disseminate your Supply Corps connection here in Athens. I have  discussed your Distinguished Alumni affiliation with Mayor Doc Eldridge. He is  in full support of the power plant. He is a great supporter or the Navy Supply  Corps School and your  Supply Corps  Distinguished  Alumni-Athens-Clarke County connection 
 
Obliviously, I will not do anything further  without acknowledgement and authorization from your office. I do believe we  can quell the ""natives"" and dramatically reduce the environmentalist's  influence against the project. Please advise. GO NAVY!!
 
Best regards, 
 
Bob

"The Other Weapon In Our War Against Terror","
Dear WRI Friends and Family,
 
A few weeks ago the WRI Board had a powerful and wide ranging  discussion of the events of September 11 and their aftermath.  We talked  about the concept of human security, and the connections among security,  environment and development.  The following are some observations flowing  from that discussion that the Board suggested I circulate to WRI's friends and  family.  With violent conflict underway, this is a difficult and uncertain  time to try to draw conclusions, but it is a critical time to think about the  future.  
 
Terrorism is hideous theater. Victims and audience are  one.  Information and images flow around the world without regard to  borders as barriers or the intentions of those who create them.  We are  compelled to respond, locked in the scenes of a tragic drama, a violent twenty  first century morality play, running round the clock on CNN.  In our minds  it began on September 11th, but in other minds it began perhaps a decade before  with the Gulf War, but now the awful question is when will it end?  How do  we create a more secure world?
 
We do not know what the men who hijacked the four planes on  September 11 and killed thousands of innocent people hoped to accomplish.   It does not appear that they were poor men, but there is reason to believe that  Osama bin Laden is bent on provoking a war in which the poor would be his  soldiers.  Neither violence nor hatred is a pathology only of the poor, but  the compound of misery, powerlessness and injustice is volatile - exactly the  mix that the terrorists who attacked us hope to ignite.  We cannot create  security only by striking at the flint; we must deal with the  tinder.
 
What if we capture the leaders of terrorist groups, seize  their resources, disrupt their networks, and deter their state sponsors, but act  with narrow focus, treating terror as a crime without a cause that we can  address, will our world be secure?  A safe and stable world requires more  fundamental changes.
 
The squalid slums in the sprawling cities in the poorest parts  of the world are growing explosively, expanding by a million people a  week.  Three-fourths of the world's agricultural lands are degraded, and  the cities are filling with people driven from rural areas by expanding  population and failing lands.  There are about a billion teenagers in the  world, most of them poor, jobless and struggling for shreds of hope.   Within a decade or so, if trends continue, there will be 27 cities in the  developing world that are bigger than New York.  If they are full of  jobless young men with nowhere to turn, they will be tinderboxes of anger and  despair.
 
One-third of the world's people face water scarcity, and water  use is rising twice as fast as population. Three great rivers, the Amu Darya,  the Colorado, and the Yellow no longer reach the sea in dry seasons. The number  facing scarcity is likely to double in the next several decades creating a band  of scarcity around the middle of the globe.  70% of the water people use is  for agriculture, and it is used to produce half the world's food.  Water  scarcity is already raising tensions in many places including the Middle East,  the Mekong Delta, and between the United States and Mexico.
 
A billion people depend for food on wild caught fish, but  two-thirds of the world's fisheries are being harvested beyond sustainability,  and many have collapsed, taking with them people's livelihoods.  Half of  all jobs worldwide depend on fisheries, forests, and agriculture.  In  one-fourth of the world's nations natural resources directly produce more income  than industry.
 
Global warming caused by the industrial world's  ever-increasing burning of coal and oil is underway, and scientists predict that  it will cause not just hotter weather, but more severe storms and  droughts.  It will intensify the agony of dry regions, worsen the misery of  the poor, and drive still more refugees from the land.  Meanwhile, two  billion people still have no access to electricity.
 
Terrorism and war are, in part, the more immediate  consequences of ever increasing oil consumption, particularly for  transportation.   Osama bin Laden has explained his terrorist acts  against the US as a response to the presence of US military bases in the Islamic  holy land of Saudi Arabia.  The US military is there to ensure access to  Saudi Arabian oil, which represents the largest oil reserves in the world, about  25%. 
 
Many of the most insecure regions of the world are also the  least democratic.  People there are not only poor, they are  voiceless.  Dependent directly on natural resources they have no say in how  those resources are used, but suffer the consequences when the decisions are  corrupt and the use is destructive.
 
The notion that security, stability, and sustainability are  linked is by no means novel.  Refugees have been driven from the land by  the collapse of natural systems for millennia.  Nations have fought for  access to scarce natural resources.  The CIA recognized the connection in  an unclassified report last year.  Human ability to improve lives while we  protect the future has grown rapidly, however, and we must use these  capabilities as an alternative weapon in our war on terror.
 
Imagine if we determined not only to root out terrorism, but  also to deprive it of soil in which to grow.  We in the United States might  triple our aid to the poorest nations from $17 to $50 per American per year,  supporting a vast improvement in education, health, and micro credit to launch  small businesses.  We would support improved agriculture, community based  fishery management, and the dispersion of practical technologies to use water  many times more efficiently. We would work for greater access for more people to  sustainable energy resources. We would work to ensure that people have the  chance to participate in decisions about natural resources and  environment.  We would honor our commitments to ensure that poor women can  plan their families.  We would seek to broaden our anti-terror alliance  into a partnership for human security, abandoning unilateralism for broad  collaboration.  We would join the same allies whose help we now seek in  confronting terrorism, to combat global climate change, using our immense  technological capacity to reduce our use of fossil fuels, and diminish our  dependence on foreign oil.  
 
The partnership for human security would make the world a  safer place even if it cannot remove all of the causes of conflict between  peoples and among nations.  Consider the alternative.  If the United  States takes direct action but withdraws from collaboration on broader purposes  any security we achieve will be ephemeral.  If our oil use continues to  rise we will have fewer options in the Middle East.  If we fail to invest  in development we will have fewer friends and fewer customers.  If we do  not solve tomorrow's problems today, we will still have today's problems  tomorrow.
 
What is WRI's role?  Do we matter?
 
There are organizations around the world, many of them WRI's  partners, who work to improve human security.  Human security is at the  heart of WRI's work.  Our mission is to ""move human society to live in ways  that protect Earth's environment and its capacity to provide for?future  generations"".  Our work is to create solutions to global problems and  vehicles for the collaboration necessary to implement them.
 
After the attacks on September 11th, WRI staff received  several thousand messages of concern and outrage from our colleagues in more  than 100 countries.  These were not the list serve exchanges of rumors and  misinformation that surged through the web, but affirmations from our partners  in values-based networks that rise above the differences of place.  They  form the links that are essential to maintain understanding in moments of  violence.
 
WRI uses the technologies of the Global Era to create  connection among people, and we use connection to provide information and  voice.  For example:
 
? Global Forest Watch supplies space based data and  Information Age tools to local groups on the ground in the world's last frontier  forests.  They collect information on who is doing what and whether it is  legal which Global Forest Watch uses to create a real time, on-line, map based  early warning system of threats to the forest, a system that enables companies  to avoid purchasing wood from unsustainable logging, and consumers to hold  companies accountable.  The groups on the ground are empowered.
? Earth  Trends provides people with the world's best source of information about their  environment and natural resources, and the tools to use that information to  influence decisions.  Information is power.  Earth Trends enables  people to find and use it.
? The Access Initiative has built a global  alliance of groups and institutions to hold governments publicly accountable for  their compliance with their commitments to open environmental governance  articulated in the Rio Declaration and the Aarhus Convention.  The  initiative will strengthen people's claims to information, voice, and  justice.
? New Ventures creates opportunity and hope.  It identifies and  supports a new generation of entrepreneurs in Latin America who are seeking to  create sustainable enterprises in their communities.  New Ventures provides  business mentoring, visibility, and access to venture capital for ideas that use  local resources and capacity sustainably, and has mobilized millions of dollars  in investment capital even during a strong economic downturn in Latin America.  
? Oil for a Finite Future demonstrates how long term deployment of more  efficient, non-fossil fueled vehicles such as hydrogen or electric cars powered  by renewable energy resources can alleviate the underlying long-term security  issues of oil depletion and global climate change, not to mention terrorism.  Since non-Persian Gulf oil production is nearing its peak we show that we cannot  drill our way to energy security.  
? SafeClimate provides tools for  individuals, businesses, and institutions to reduce their impact on climate  change by taking low cost steps to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gasses  that they cause, making climate protection as easy as putting out the recycling  bin.  Americans are hungry to do something that helps.  When they do,  their government will follow them.
? Climate and Developing Countries - WRI  has been a leading voice of reason about the role of developing countries in  addressing climate change, developing widely used indicators, and policy  proposals that have helped create the basis for a dialogue more constructive  than the sloganeering of many American political leaders.
? Digital Dividends  explores the opportunities for development, empowerment, and improved management  of natural resources on the other side of the digital divide, and has linked  leaders in the digital industry to hundreds of innovative projects created by  local entrepreneurs and activists worldwide.
 
We have done innovative and influential work on energy,  agriculture, and water resources.  We have sought to engage businesses and  investors in creating strategies for sustainability.  We believe that work  that connects people across the boundaries of region and sector is the most  powerful antidote to the toxins of misery, mistrust, and disempowerment.   We will continue to be advocates of the proposition that protecting the web of  life that connects and supports us all is essential to long term  security.
 
Violence is not new.  Brutality and hatred have afflicted  humanity for as long as the capacity to do good has elevated us.  We  learned the knowledge of good and evil only when both entered our hearts.   Do we have the occasion to do good as well as justice in responding to the  terrible evil that was committed on September 11th?
 
The modern violent evil is both terrifying and shocking not  only because it occurred on American soil, but also because it was so sudden and  powerful.  The force of evil has been amplified, its reach extended, its  speed accelerated like so many things in the global era, by technology and  connection.  The jetliners that were the instruments of destruction are  among the forces shrinking our world.
 
Jonathan

I attempted to attend the all employee meeting but was turned away at the door. The reason was I lost my badge during a business trip last week. A Mr. Alex Varez (director security) informed me that no one can enter the meeting without an Enron ID badge. So I waited and watched. I watched as three gentleman were let in by a Mr. Steve Kane or Kean. I questioned Mr. Varez and a Mr. Mark Jeffries as to what criterion did the rules change. He stated Mr. Kane/Kean vouched for the gentlemen. Of course I left and hurried back to listen to your assessment and write this e-mail. The fundamentals are often waived just like the entry of the three gentlemen who where allowed in the meeting. The sad part is that I have been here almost five years and shook the hands of 5 people entering the meeting all who could have vouched for me. However, in this example knowing the right person mattered. The rules did not apply equally. I said all this to say now more than ever you need to drive home our values. And force a wholesome discipline throughout our organization. It appears that the management team is looking at external indicators instead of internal indicators. If we feel our values are being delivered in-house then the collective ""we"" will change external perceptions. 

Here is some food for thought that will assist in changing the direction of Enron. I do not know if you are a God fearing man. However, my intuition says you are. The foundation of the EBN is on blessed ground, the earth is old church property. I don't know if you ever considered that but I am relatively sure that it is fact. Any business within the walls on this ground is in a better position to prosper. I am not sure if the new building is on the blessed grounds. It could be beneficial to have the new building blessed. An old tradition for future success. For me it is the basic premise for success as we move forward.

Respectfully, David Tonsall

RELEVANT TO THE NEWS

Vermont senator James Jeffords has changed his party affiliation from Republican to Independent, giving control of the Senate to the Democrats. Before Jeffords announced his decision, AEI scholar Norman J. Ornstein wrote an article reviewing the White House's relations with the senator and predicting that Jeffords might switch parties.

Daily Web Edition: http://www.earthtimes.org

October 25, 2001

Mr. Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Enron Corporation

Dear Mr. Lay:

The Earth Times/Conference News Daily has been invited to publish daily print
and Web editions at the upcoming Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Doha, November 9-13, 2001. These daily editions--which will
supplement WTO and Qatar's extraordinary efforts to ensure the success of the
meeting--will be distributed to delegates each morning at their hotels, and
also at the Doha Conference Center. As you know, this critical meeting will
consider the admission of China, and also decide on launching a new round of
trade talks. It will attract thousands of top officials from government,
industry, diplomacy, as well as media representatives.

We will also simultaneously publish daily editions in New York, as the United
Nations  General Assembly reopens its fall meeting cancelled on September 11,
and hosts heads-of-state from November 10-16. President George W. Bush will
lead world leaders in signaling a renewed drive against terrorism and launch
a new initiative to jump-start global economic growth.

Our newspaper will be the paper of record at both the WTO and General
Assembly meetings. It is guaranteed to reach all participants, many of whom
are eager readers from our coverage of major international conferences for
more than a decade, including UN gatherings and the annual meeting of the
World Economic Foorum in Davos, Switzerland. Our not-for-profit newspaper has
made a mark as an independent, nonpartisan editorial voice on international
economic, environmental and social issues. Our Chairman and Publisher is Mr.
Theodore W. Kheel, the eminent lawyer and mediator.

We plan to publish a total of ten daily editions in print and on the Web from
November 8 through 17. We would very much like to invite Enron to sponsor
these special editions either fully or in part, and to use our publication as
an effective means of conveying your position on the critical issues that
will be discussed to the audiences in Qatar and New York in a position to do
something about them. Our overall budget for both the WTO and General
Assembly meetings is US$150,000.

Enron could contribute any amount it wishes. In exchange, you will get
front-page mention each day, plus a four-color ad in every issue.

I would be most obliged for your consideration. Please be assured of the
utmost cooperation of our newspaper and myself.

With thanks again for your continuing support, and my highest personal
regards,

Yours sincerely,
Pranay
Editor-in-Chief and President

"You and I attended Davos; Maharishi's approach to PREVENT terrorism","You and I both attended the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The Damocles sword of terrorism is STILL hanging over the world. I am contacting you now concerning an approach to PREVENT terrorism which I feel merits your scrutiny.

This highly effective, new technology of defense has been put forward by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the worldwide Transcendental Meditation program. If, after reading the following message, this unique, peaceful approach interests you, I can set up a private conversation for you with eminent scientists who support it.

I feel even a short conversation will be interesting and a valuable use of your time. These scientists include Dr. John Hagelin, a world-renowned quantum physicist and presidential candidate of the Natural Law Party in 2000, who has been meeting with members of the US Congress and business leaders worldwide. The response has been very positive and enthusiastic.  (Please visit http://www.hagelin.org to learn more about Dr. Hagelin and his success.)

As a businessman, I am always seeking practical solutions to problems. I have experienced this peaceful solution first-hand, and it really works. It diffuses acute social stress, including the deep-seated ethnic, political, and religious tensions that fuel terrorism and conflict. Maharishi's technology of defense has been field-tested repeatedly over the past 20 years. Nineteen scientific studies, verified with over 50 replications and published in independent peer-reviewed journals, validate its effectiveness. (See http://www.PermanentPeace.org )

Clearly, nothing else has proven effective in PREVENTING terrorist attacks before they begin.

I feel the most important lesson from Davos is the interconnectedness of the world's economic, social, and political relationships -- a lesson which, tragically, terrorism has concretely hammered home. It is from the deepest, quantum mechanical level of life, where interconnectedness is most profound, that Maharishi's programs work.

I urge you to take a few minutes to visit the web site http://www.PermanentPeace.org , where you can see the profound scientific foundation for Maharishi's technology of defense.

Please kindly respond with the times when you would be available, if you are interested in a conversation with Dr. Hagelin concerning this proven approach to prevent terrorism and create a foundation for world peace.

"Competitive Analysis Update #21- Aftermath of Terrorist Strikes","
Strategic Synopsis
September 21, 2001
10:30 AM

?	The presidential address last night confirmed that a major military mobilization is under way and that a long campaign is ahead, extending well beyond Afghanistan.  Not surprisingly, the speech did not clarify the timing of the attack.  
?	The president warned the Taliban that unless it handed over Osama bin Laden and the leaders of his al-Qaeda terrorist network, it would face devastating military action. ""They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate,"" Bush told the US Congress.  So far, the Taliban are refusing to comply.
?	As such, U.S. military forces will strike in Afghanistan as soon as a target of opportunity presents itself.  As the President himself noted in his speech last night, some of the special forces operations will not be visible to the public, while other steps such as airstrikes will be dramatic and unmistakable.  Trying to figure out the precise timing of specific types of strikes is probably impossible at this point.  However, we safely state the following:
o	The President set the stage for a long conflict last night, and equity markets are anticipating significant economic pessimism.  Consumer confidence is likely to worsen if additional terrorist attacks are made against U.S. targets.
o	Our sources indicate that Bush spoke at length with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah this week, and Abdullah agreed to lower oil prices.  No specifics were discussed.   Preliminary information suggests that Saudi Arabia is carrying out extra liftings in the second half of September and moving crude cargoes closer to market.  
o	When the initial attack comes against Afghanistan, oil markets will likely see confirmation that no threat to crude oil supply is taking place.  But speculation about further strikes against other terrorist-sponsoring states should maintain a degree of uncertainty in the market. 
o	The war against terrorism will eventually have to deal with Iran and Iraq; both are major OPEC producers.  Persuading Iran to cooperate is more likely to involve diplomacy than force.   Some Administration officials, led by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, are pushing for a move against Baghdad.  So far, this group has been overruled by advocates of a more cautious approach, who realize that attacking Iraq will seriously undermine Arab support for the US.  
o	Washington also has to be concerned with stability in Pakistan, where much of the population (including senior military and intelligence figures) supports the Taliban.
o	Terrorist retaliation to the U.S. attacks appears to be likely.  Attempts to strike infrastructure targets, including energy facilities both here and overseas, are expected.
o    On the ground today, heavy fighting is raging in northern Afghanistan as opposition forces attack Taliban troops.  The Northern Alliance forces are taking advantage of US pressure on the Taliban to recapture key areas and avenge the recent death of their leader.

"Heart Breaking","
The tears rolled down my face the night Channel 11 broke through with the announcement that Enron was going to merge with Dynegy. My heart was breaking, seeing the hurt in Ken Lay's eyes and to see our company tumbling down as if it was the New York Trade Center this was my first thought and question how could a few cruel and selfish individuals bring something so wonderful down after so many years of hard work? The E means something to me. I'm so proud to be apart of this great company that you and Enron employees built. There are so many roomers of blame, but I can't for a second believe you had anything to do with this I know your a man of your word and speak from your heart and I'm so sorry you couldn't enjoy your retirement and had to come back to this mess. I just wanted you to know that I'm behind your decisions and have the utmost respect for you also. Hopefully some day the individuals that put this great company down will be held accountable and be made put the money they stole back to the company. Take care of yourself and your health we need you.
Sincerely, Velvet

"Your decision","Mr. Lay, 

I do not know you other than what I have been told by peers.  Everything has been with regard to a very high respect for you personally and what you have done with Enron.  I am an employee in the $40,000 dollar range of EOTT and can not comprehend the salaries and monies made by top executives in shares given and ""privileges"" extended.

It is an honorable thing you are doing by not accepting the $60 + million but I personally feel you deserve something.  You have worked hard, probably worried many hours, and yes, probably played hard and enjoyed much and with the empire you have built will continue to live the rest of your life in luxury (a very enviable position to be in).  

We are all where we are because of decisions we have made and your employees made their decision based on their best judgement call at the time.  Working for a company is like a marriage.  You put your faith, trust and confidence in the person of your choice and that person can change and put you through a lot of turmoil and grief, the same with the company you marry.  Employees will be able to recoop some of their savings once their stock has been converted to Dynegy.  I am not trying to change your mind about the money but want you to know that their are employees with feelings and a good mind to think things through and feel you are justified in accepting some reward for the dynasty you have helped to build.

Good luck to you in the future.  Continue to enjoy your life.

Respectfully,

"Proposal for disclosure Committee","Dear Mr. Lay,

Greetings from Canada.

I had forwarded a letter yesterday to enquire your interest in obtaining
the services of Mr. Jack Welch (GE) to head up an independant committee
to review the limited partnership liabilities for Enron.

Please indicate if you are interested in this proposal.

If not, what is your plan to address the confidence crisis in disclosure
at this time?

Sincerely,

"Dabhol Washington Update","
	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening:

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week.  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:
	1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.
	2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.

	At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.
	Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.

	Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

"Letter from Boris Brevnov","Dear Ken,

I would like to thank you for the great experience that I had with Enron,
and for the opportunity that you gave me three years ago. I joined Enron
looking for a change and I have never regretted of my choice.

A lot of things changed over this time. In my first presentation to Gazprom
in Moscow, I remember, that I pictured Enron as the largest gas pipeline
operator in Americas aggressively looking for energy development projects in
emerging markets. Two years later, I was talking to Microsoft executives in
Redmond, who were looking for a partner to conquer a high-tec broadband
world. I don't know any other company, which can offer such an opportunity
for a change and growth, and which is able to change itself so much as
Enron.

I am grateful that over this time you have been personally involved in my
business career and introduced me to the Enron management team - Mark
Frevert, Richard DiMichele, Vince Kaminsky and others.

I also would like to use this opportunity to admit some of my mistakes. As
it was my first experience inside a corporate environment (not as CEO), it
took me some time to develop relationships with people inside Enron. These
relationships are critical to achieving success within the company. But
Enron is a great place to learn, and in a culture that encourages innovation
and risk-taking, some mistakes are inevitable. I am pleased that the deal
that my team and I developed and managed to provide Microsoft (MSN) with
broadband network was successful (you may remember we discussed this idea
prior to my move to Enron Broadband Services).

This spring I took an advantage of your recommendation and graduated from
the Harvard Advanced Management Program. It was a great experience and I
learned professionally and personally.  It was a very competitive group of
executives from all over the world, and the program consisted of a
three-month intensive academic curriculum. Together with one of my Harvard
classmates and his Canadian telecom company, we are now working to start a
new business in the US.

You have a challenging task to return Enron to its leadership position. I
admire the steps that you are making. Without restoring integrity to
internal and external relationships, it would be impossible to achieve this
goal. I have no doubts that you and your colleagues will make this happen.

I wish you all the best and thank you again for the opportunity that you
offered me. I hope that our paths will cross again.

Best regards to you and your family,

Boris Brevnov

"Filter & Temp for ANTHRAX","Dear Advisory Board members:

Dr.Mark Wheelis, PhD emailed the following:

Inhaling anthrax can be spread by aerosol only by droplets small enought to
penetrate into the alveoli--approximately 5 micrometers diameter.
Does not spread from person to person. HEPA filters will remove it,
but not normal air filters.

From Reports from Russia, it is evident high temp. (air circulation) will
kill Anthrax. I worked as Chief Engineer in Texaco and Shell buildings in
Houston. I am familiar with filteration and heater systems. I request a
discussion may be arranged among the interested Advisory Board Mebers to
review this topic.

Subject: Peruvian Mining,Oil,Gas and Energy.


SOME NOTES ON PERUVIAN MINING,OIL,NATURAL GAS AND ENERGY.

Peru's production of metals,crude oil,natural gas and
electrical energy continued at a high level during the
first half of 2001,as follows:

Copper - 261,000 MT ( Y2000-553,924 MT ).
Lead - 138,000 MT ( Y2000-270,000 MT ).
Zinc - 478,000 MT ( Y2000-910,303 MT ).
Silver - 1,253 MT ( Y2000-2,438 MT ).
Gold - 64 MT ( Y2000-133 MT ).
Iron Ore - 1,463,000 MT ( Y2000-2,645,991 ).
Tin - 18,000 MT ( Y2000-37,410 MT ).

In 2000,Peru rated 2nd in the world in silver
production;3rd in lead;3rd in zinc;3rd in tin;5th in
copper and 8th in gold - 23% of total government
revenues are earned from taxes on mining companies - 49%
of total export value is from mining products ( $3.3
billion in 2000 expected to rise to $5 billion by
2005 ) - $10 billion is estimated to be invested in
exploration and exploitation over the next 8 years - the
world's largest mining investment of $2.3 billion
resulted in the recent startup of this copper/zinc mega-
mine ( 1 million MT of copper concentrates and 400,000
MT of zinc concentrates per year ) - $330 million are
spent annually on mining supplies ( drill
bits,fuel,explosives,chemicals,tyres and spare parts )
and 60,000 people are directly employed by mining
companies and another 300,000 are indirectly employed.

Crude oil produced in the 1st half of 2001 was 18,104
million barrels ( 100 MBD versus 96 MBD in 2000 down
from a high of 127 MBD in 1995 ). Some $710 million is
earmarked for drilling by 2004 which is expected to
increase crude oil production considerably.

Natural gas production in the 1st half of 2001 was 4,918
million cubic feet or 27 MCFD compared with 33 MCFD in
2000 and 40 MCFD in 1999..July's production was very
high at 61 MCFD which reflects on a higher demand by
thermal power plants..The large Camisea gas field said
to contain 8 trillion cubic feet of gas,is under
development to bring this field into production by 2004
at a total capital investment 0f $3.05 billion.

Electrical energy produced in the !st half of 2001 was
10,145 Gwh ( 20,050 Gwh in 2000 ).Hydro power plants
produced 81% of the total power generated in 2000.
Thermal power plants,mainly fired with oil,supplied the
rest..Only 75% of the population of Peru are served with
electrical power which costs consumers about $0.10 per
Kwh. The operation of the Camisea gas field will bring
gas to the Peruvian coast for the cost of electricity at
a much lower cost. Several power plants,tranmission and
distribution projects are underway or planned for the
future at a cost of several hundreds of millions of
dollars.

Ken, we are working with a team that is building ethanol plants throughout
the Southeast and the Midwest, and we are in the process of arranging the
right capital partner as well as identifying the right strategic partner for
that endeavor. The other players in this ambitious project have
relationships into Enron, but I thought that you might be able to shove me
in the right direction of the person to talk to there.

I hope all is well with you, and one day when you are in the DC area and
have nothing better to do you will let me have the opportunity to visit over
dinner and reflect on how many years it has been since you and we created
the Natural Gas Clearing House. We are having a lot of fun putting together
large private equity deals and you might find that aspect of what we do as
possibly interesting as well. We have expanded into the energy and utilities
space as telecomm and technology have had their share of problems. In any
event, would appreciate the input and look forward to a visit in the not too
distant future. Best regards, Tom

Dear Dr. Lay:

Today was Diwali, the festival of lights. As I sat and prayed this
evening my thoughts turned to you and I said a small prayer for all of
my friends at Enron.

I have as you would expect been following the events of the last few
weeks with concern. I wish you all the strength and resolve as you
commit yourself to leading Enron through these difficult times. You have
always been a leader to those who have worked closely with you and have
surely faced more difficult times than these and successfully.

"Enron Metals Ltd (Enron Europe Office)","Dear Mr Lay,

I write to you as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Enron
Corporation because I would like you to know that I am on my second period
of sick leave in a year due to work related stress.

A year ago I was apologised to by the Human Resources Department and told
that they would not allow it to happen again.  Through constant pressure and
the unfair way in which I have been treated, the advice of my doctor and
counsellor, as they are concerned with my health, was to accept the
voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself
recently.

Though due to my exceptional circumstances I wrote the attached letter.

Today I received the attached response and I feel totally devastated that
Enron Europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my
life and that of my family's.

I read in Enron's literature that you care about your employees and their
families, and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me
protection against the circumstances that I find myself in, but to my
complete and utter dismay I find this is not the case and  in my
experience I have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally
ignored in the response letter.  I haven't once been contacted by Enron
Europe to see how I'm coping and give me any support whatsoever.  They are
showing no care or concern for me or my family.

I write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful
situation that I find myself in due to your company.

Under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has

"All that's happening","Dear Mr Lay,
 
I don't know if this will get to you personally or if someone filters your email, but I sincerely hope you get a chance to read this.
 
I haven't been with Enron very long.  I was hired in August and left my old job in Austin because I wanted the experience of working for a great company.  I want you to know that I do not regret my decision to come here.  I have never worked for a company that treats people with such dignity.  It amazes me that throughout all of this, I knew that you would do everything you could to make sure that the employees are okay.  I can't say that I would have felt that way at any other job I have had.  I know now that good companies are out there, and have no doubt that I will have a chance to experience that again.
 
The past few months must have been a nightmare for you.  I cannot imagine what it feels like to build a company to greatness and watch it disintegrate because of the greed of a few.  I'm sure that no words can console you, but I want you to know that most of the employees I have talked to do not blame you.  
 
Whatever happens next week, I want you to know that you are in my prayers.
 
Debbie Riall

"FERC Meeting:  Market Based Rate Review","The Commission discussed its market based rate policy at today's meeting.  They did not vote out an order today, but expect to take up this issue again next meeting.  The staff memo recommended the following:

For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the ""Supply Margin Assessment"" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  

Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.

Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  

Since the interim measure is only a ""snapshot"" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.  Commissioner Breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement, stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the Commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability.

"Volcker","Ken: 
Good to hear your voice this morn.  As I said, I have intentionally avoiding bothering you guys until I had something to contribute. 
The info that follows is probably more than you want.  But I gave Paul your (almost) complete history and I think you should know his. 
First met in mid-fifties when I was at Dallas Fed and assigned for two weeks to NYFed to learn firsthand about open market operations on the trading desk, where Paul worked.  (I was an ""Associate Economist"" with FOMC and advised Dallas Fed President on policy and I accompanied him to those super-secret meetings.) 
Paul and I hit it off and when I left Treasury in 1961 Dillon let Bob Roosa bring Paul in to take over my duties.  By then I was with ABA in New York and Paul and I became friends during my frequent work with the Dillon Treasury and with Roosa. 
Paul left Treasury in about the mid-sixties to become VP of planning at Chase.  In late 1968, when David Kennedy asked me to be his number two, I said yes on two conditions: That I get a car for both business and personal use (okay) and that he bring in Volcker as under secretary for monetary affairs and that latter report directly to him, not through me (as had been Dillon's system).  He said okay if we could get Paul.  Upon which I went to Chase and, given the stipulations about reporting, he agreed to come. 
He hit it off great with DK's successors, Connally and then Shultz, and left in '74 (I think) to be pres of NYFed.  Markets in effect forced Carter to appoint Paul to head Fed in 1979, where he led the System into breaking the back of double-digit inflation (plus sharp but relatively short recessioin). 
I think he went with Wolfensohn from there and made a ton of money. After W left Paul took over and later sold out to Bankers Trust. 
Although Paul is an independent (traditonal at NYFed), he is very public-minded and also somewht left-of-center on public policy.  One of my many sins in eyes of Nixon's White House gang is the true belief that I put something over on them in getting Paul to join us.  Paul was for many years a member of ACCF board as favor to me but finally resigned over our estate-tax position last year (and never did like our capital gains positions).  He and Pug may be considered soulmates on some of these issues, especially estate tax. 
In our initial conversation this morning, Paul asked me if Skilling's resignation related to recent problems.  I said I did not know but did not think so. 
Paul is teaching at Princeton and looking for ways to give away his money, which he seems embarrassed to have.  His wife, who had chronic health problems, died a couple of years ago.  I think one of the children had health problems too. 
In our second conversation today I told Paul that I was convinced that Enron was (mentioned innovation awards) and still is a great company.  I strongly urged him to accept a relationship that would show his confidence and also advance your efforts. 
Good luck. Call or e-mail me if you have any questions or if there is anything else you want me to do. 
                                                        Charly

"CAFC Ruling on 2003 Prozac Patent","
We learned today that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has modified its opinion of August 9, 2000 in which it found the 2003 Prozac patent invalid for double patenting.  In essence, the Court has again ruled that the patent is invalid for double patenting, but has used a different analysis to reach this conclusion.   
We intend to seek legal review of today's decision.  Although it is possible that the legal review process could delay Barr from entering the market on August 3, we continue to plan for Barr launching generic fluoxetine at that time. 
On a related note, in our current litigation with Zenith/Reddy-Cheminor, Zenith used the prior Barr decision to allege that the olanzapine patent was invalid for double patenting. The reversal of the August 9 decision removes that argument from Zenith's presentation of its case.   
Attached to this message are copies of press releases issued by Lilly and Barr regarding the CAFC's decision. 
    
Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions in this regard.

\par }{\f1\cgrid0 Recently, I was asked to look at the recent events through the lens of military history.  I have joined the cast of thousands who have written an ""open letter to Americans.""\line \line \line Dear friends and fellow Americans                 14 September, 2001\line \line Like everyone else in this great country, I am reeling from last week's attack on our sovereignty. But unlike some, I am not reeling from surprise. As a career soldier and a student and teacher of military history, I have a different perspective and I think you should hear it. This war will be won or lost by the American citizens, not diplomats, politicians or soldiers.\line \line Let me briefly explain.\line \line In spite of what the media, and even our own government is telling us, this act was not committed by a group of mentally deranged fanatics. To dismiss them as such would be among the gravest of mistakes. This attack was committed by a ferocious, intelligent and dedicated adversary. Don't take this the wrong way. I don't admire these men and I deplore their tactics, but I respect their capabilities. The many parallels that have been made with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropos. Not only because it was a brilliant sneak attack against a complacent America, but also because we may well be pulling our new adversaries out of caves 30 years after we think this war is over, just like my father's generation had to do with\line the formidable Japanese in the years following WW II.\line \line These men hate the United States with all of their being, and we must not underestimate the power of their moral commitment. Napoleon, perhaps the world's greatest combination of soldier and statesman, stated ""the moral is to the physical as three is to one."" Patton thought the Frenchman underestimated its importance and said moral conviction was five times more important in battle than physical strength. Our enemies are willing - better said anxious -- to give their lives for their cause. }{\f1\fs24\cgrid0
\par
\par }{\f1\cgrid0 How committed are we America? And for how long?\line \line In addition to demonstrating great moral conviction, the recent attack demonstrated a mastery of some of the basic fundamentals of warfare taught to most military officers worldwide, namely simplicity, security and surprise. When I first heard rumors that some of these men may have been trained at our own Air War College, it made perfect sense to me. This was\line not a random act of violence, and we can expect the same sort of military competence to be displayed in the battle to come. }{\f1\fs24\cgrid0
\par
\par }{\f1\cgrid0 This war will escalate, with a good portion of it happening right here in the good ol' U.S. of A.}{\f1\fs24\cgrid0
\par
\par }{\f1\cgrid0 These men will not go easily into the night. They do not fear us. We must not fear them. In spite of our overwhelming conventional strength as the world's only ""superpower"" (a truly silly term), we are the underdog in this fight. As you listen to the carefully scripted rhetoric designed to prepare us for the march for war, please realize that America is not equipped or seriously trained for the battle ahead. To be certain, our soldiers are much better than the enemy, and we have some excellent ""counter-terrorist"" organizations, but they are mostly trained for hostage rescues, airfield seizures, or the occasional ""body snatch,"" (which may come in handy). We will be fighting a war of annihilation, because if their early efforts are any indication, our enemy is ready and willing to die to the last man. Eradicating the enemy will be costly and time consuming. They have already deployed their forces in as many as 20 countries, and are likely living the lives of everyday citizens. Simply put, our soldiers will be tasked with a search and destroy mission on multiple foreign landscapes, and the public must be patient and supportive until the strategy and tactics can be worked out.\line \line For the most part, our military is still in the process of redefining itself and presided over by men and women who grew up with - and were promoted because they excelled in - Cold War doctrine, strategy and tactics. This will not be linear warfare, there will be no clear ""centers of gravity"" to strike with high technology weapons. Our vast technological edge will certainly be helpful, but it will not be decisive. Perhaps the perfect metaphor for the coming battle was introduced by the terrorists themselves aboard the hijacked aircraft -- this will be a knife fight, and it will be won or lost by the ingenuity and will of citizens and soldiers, not by software or smart bombs. We must also be patient with our military leaders.\line \line Unlike Americans who are eager to put this messy time behind us, our adversaries have time on their side, and they will use it. They plan to fight a battle of attrition, hoping to drag the battle out until the American public loses its will to fight. This might be difficult to believe in this euphoric time of flag waving and patriotism, but it is generally acknowledged that America lacks the stomach for a long fight. We need only look as far back as Vietnam, when North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap\line (also a military history teacher) defeated the United States of America without ever winning a major tactical battle. American soldiers who marched to war cheered on by flag waving Americans in 1965 were reviled and spat upon less than three years later when they returned. Although we hope that Usama Bin Laden is no Giap, he is certain to understand and employ the\line concept. We can expect not only large doses of pain like the recent attacks, but! also less audacious ""sand in the gears"" tactics, ranging from livestock infestations to attacks at water supplies and power distribution facilities.}{\f1\fs24\cgrid0
\par }{\f1\cgrid0 \line These attacks are designed to hit us in our ""comfort zone"" forcing the average American to ""pay more and play less"" and eventually eroding our resolve. But it can only work if we let it. It is clear to me that the will of the American citizenry - you and I - is the center of gravity the enemy has targeted. It will be the fulcrum upon which victory or defeat will turn. He believes us to be soft, impatient, and self-centered. He may be right, but if so, we must change. The Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz, (the most often quoted and least read military theorist in history), says that there is a ""remarkable trinity of war"" that is composed of the (1) will of the people, (2) the political leadership of the government, and (3) the chance and probability that plays out on the field of battle, in that order. Every American citizen was in the crosshairs of last Tuesday's attack, not just those that were unfortunate enough to be in the World Trade Center or Pentagon. The will of the American people will decide this war. If we are to win, it will be because we have what it takes to persevere through a few more hits, learn from our! mistakes, improvise, and adapt. If we can do that, we will eventually prevail. }{\f1\fs24\cgrid0

\par }{\f1\cgrid0 Everyone I've talked to In the past few days has shared a common frustration, saying in one form or another ""I just wish I could do something!"" You are already doing it.

"Change of Control Provisions","Ken - 

Although I cannot pretend to feel the pressure you have felt over the past year, I do appreciate your interest in the employees as expressed in the current decision regarding the Change of Control Provision.  In light of the current circumstances, it is an honorable action.  I wouldn't be here (4 yrs; as an Analyst, then and currently an Associate) if I didn't believe in Enron and would have left long ago.  Enron has had a profound impact in more than the energy sector, and will continue regardless of Enron's form, simply based on its historical innovation.

To have our health and have had the opportunity to do what Enron has done is astonishing, especially these days.  I wish you the best in time ahead.

Be well,
Ilan

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"EBS Computer Equipment","I'm a recent EBS redeployment person who found a job in ETS.  Late last week my group got flat screen monitors to replace the old, large, bulky ones.  We moved to 3 Allen Center on Monday evening 9/17.  On Tuesday evening, 9/18 someone came into this area and stole 2 of the new flat screen monitors.  This is being investigated, however, we now have 2 persons without a monitor.
 
What is happening to all the computer equipment from EBS terminated/redeployed persons?  If we had access to this equipment, the monitors could be quickly replaced.  Instead, 2 old, large bulky monitors are being delivered as a ""temporary"" fix while ETS orders new equipment.  Why is ETS ordering new equipment when a transfer of computer assets from EBS to ETS could speedily resolve this problem? 
 
All Enron companies could benefits if the unused equipment from EBS was recycled back into Enron.

Dear Mr. Cisneros.

Thank you very much for your kind words on the recent tragedy in Lima,
specially in a day like today. We at the Consulate appreciated a lot.
Please find attached the letter we sent just now to the Mayor's Office for
Economic Delelopment & International Trade, asking for humanitarian
assistance. If you could circulate the lleter it will help a great deal. We
sure can receive donations of medicines at the Consulate. In case people
would like to send money please mention to issued checks to ""Consulate
General of Peru"" .

Sincerely,

Carlos Velasco, Consul General

Mr. Ron Bernstein
Director of the Mayor's Office for Economic Development and int. Trade
Dear Mr.Bernstein,

As you may know by the news last Saturday occurred a great tragedy in Peru,
related to a large fire in downtown Lima, which killed nearly 300 persons
and caused 700 injured.

The authorities of the Government of Per? are requesting urgent humanitarian
assistance in medicines for burns and medical tolls to treat the injured.
Due to the magnitude of the situation  the Government has declared a two
days of  official mourning.

Although this tragedy is no match to the horrendous terrorist attacks of
September 11th. in New York, there is a great need for help and cooperation
to pale the suffering of the victims.

In this sense, I would appreciate very much if your Office could mobilized
any local agencies or private corporation to make donations in humanitarian
aid to be send to Lima in the next days.

On our part, the Peruvian community  have organized a gathering to collect
money and buy medicines to be held today at Marthas's Golden Palace (1755 W.
48th. Avenue) for the New Years Eve.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation,

Sincerely,

Carlos Velasco Mendiola
Consul General of Peru

"ADV: Pay-As-You-Grow Networking","This message is from Harte-Hanks on behalf of Array Networks.

Challenge
Running a web site has never been more challenging. The high volume of traffic and customized content has placed unprecedented demands on your network to achieve desired web site performance.

In the past, the solution has been to acquire more servers and software to handle such tasks as load balancing, caching, SSL acceleration, and security. Unfortunately, traditional approaches employ multiple pieces of hardware from a variety of vendors that are not only difficult to implement and support, but are also exceedingly expensive. With many IT budgets being frozen or reduced, chances are you can't afford what you need.

Until now

The Array family of Web traffic management appliances integrates the following seven essential features into a single, powerful device: Server Load Balancing, Caching, SSL Acceleration, Global Server Load Balancing, Webwall for Web Security, Content Rewrite and Clustering.  Array appliances offer four distinct product platforms and different pay-as-you-grow solution packages, so you can choose the hardware features, software capabilities and pricing that meet your requirements. More importantly, only Array provides a built-in upgrade path and lets you quickly and economically add capabilities with just a phone call-avoiding expensive service calls to add hardware or install other devices.

Savings
Over a period of 3 years, an Array 1000 can reduce your Total Cost of Ownership by as much as 78%.
* Hardware costs reduced by as much as 73%
* Operations costs cut by up to 68%
* Maintenance costs cut by as much as 78%
* Power consumption (part of operations costs) trimmed by up to 87%
* Rack space (part of operating costs) conserved by up to 68%

Performance
Ziff Davis' e-testing labs confirmed in September 2001 that the Array 1000 performed 4,312 HTTP requests per second using a pool of nine Web servers and delivered 131 percent to 185 percent more HTTP requests per second than Cisco's Arrowpoint CSS 11800 and Nortel's Alteon 180e. Impressed? The bottom line is even better: The Array Networks 7-in-One solution costs nearly half as much as Cisco's single box solution.

"Update on DOH September 26","September 26, 2001

To: Disaster Relief Advisory Board - Defense of Houston

1. The news as you will see on the website today in the news clippings,
is further evidence suggesting that bin Ladan's associates were
attempting to procure a chemical and/or biological weapons in means of
deployment such as crop duster airplanes.

2. The Executive Board as you can see from your e-mails, Dr. Kenneth
Mattox, Professor of Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine and Chief of
Surgery and of the Medical Staff at Ben Taub General Hospital, has been
working in this general areas for years.  He has found time in his busy
schedule to put a lot of thought into this crisis and has made
suggestions that the rest of us had not thought of.  I am sure that you
will agree with the decision to add him to the Executive Board.  Houston
owes him a lot already.

3. Privacy/Security - Please remember not to share these e-mails with
anyone as they contain the e-mail addresses of prominent people who
could be deluged with e-mail.  We give out no e-mail addresses or
telephone or fax numbers of Board members to anyone.  We have used group
e-mails because: 1) no one objected when I asked, 2) so members can
communicate privately, and 3) because it is faster.  Once again, if
anyone objects, please just say so.

The website hits are only 300 or so, but recent media inquiries to me,
Dr. Duke, Dr. Mattox and Dr. Feigin, to name just a few, suggests that
there is a lot of public interest in this issue.  For this reason, we
will keep the website public as an education forum (it is the only one
with links to all of the 16 relative websites, with daily updates, and
it is the only one in Houston - period).  However, we will password -
protect the bulletin board for our advisory board members.  We will
e-mail you the password.  The user i.d. will be Houston, and the
password will be Defense.    We encourage you to create your own
password and of course, it is critical that the password not be shared.

Once the bulletin board is up, it will be much easier to conduct
discussions, votes, etc.

4. Acceptances - To date, we have(60) YES and (1) REGRET.  We have
edited the membership of the advisory board to reflect the accepted
invitees.  Please RSVP, if you have not already done so, and we will
restore your name to the list.  The duties are non-existent and the
effort will, if it succeeds, have a brief but useful life.

If you would like to continue to receive e-mail updates and have access
to the website, but prefer not to have your name listed as an Advisory
Board Member, you don't need to do anything, but please contact us if
you wish to have your name removed from this list, and we will do so
immediately.  No one has made such a request, but we want to be
respectful of people's time and privacy.  We appreciate the fact that
you or your office gave us these e-mail addresses, but we don't want to
clog your inbox.  Let us know if you want to unsubscribe.

Will those of you who have accepted, please review the title next to
your name and send us an e-mail, so the title will read exactly the way
you want it to read.

5.  Plan - I will take a crack at drafting a plan to serve as a
springboard for discussion on the website's password-protected bulletin
board.  I hope to post it by Thursday evening.

I hope you have already seen (for the clippings) in the News section of
the website announcing that Mayor Lee Brown has asked Dr. Ralph Feigin,
the Chancellor for  Baylor College of Medicine, to take the lead as the
liasion for the physician community.  The Mayor has announced that more
drills will begin next week.  Dr. Feigin has many years of experience in
the problem of biological weapons and is a Board Certified Specialist in
Pediatric Infectious Diseases,  in addition to being a Chairman of
Medicine at Texas Children's Hospital.

Thank you again for your interest.  It is critical that the medical
community make the best plans it can, undertake research to improve our
readiness and our medical defenses, and the medical community very much
needs the help of the leadership of Greater Houston.

Sincerely,

S. Ward Casscells, M.D.

""Theme Button"" and ""Budget Button"" 
on CDPI Website Aimed at Helping Planners
 
 
Concept Design Productions, Inc. announces  two new improvements  to their 200-plus page website at http://www.conceptdesigninc.com.
 
The new Theme Button is designed to make event planners' jobs easier,  offering more than 1,000 environmental elements and stage sets that are categorized by themes, i.e. Western or Patriotic, Sci-Fi or Gothic, among others.
 
With a simple click, planners can go directly to pages loaded with structural elements meeting the themed criteria they need.  Once there, they can see just what elements are already constructed and ready to rent, or they can view dozens of fabricated environments available to them for a fraction of the cost of custom creation.  
 
Also debuting on the CDPI website in 2002 is the new Budget Button, which allows planners with a set budget to immediately access only those scenic elements that fall within that budget.  It is hoped that such advancements to the existing site will afford planners an easier, more cost-effective use of their time when planning events.
 
Concept Design Productions, Inc. has a 20-plus year reputation as an innovative leader in the event industry.  If you would like more information, we encourage you to access our website, http://www.conceptdesigninc.com .

"","Dear Ken,

It has been many years since we talked.  You may remember me as your
neighbor in Park Grove many years ago. I have followed your career in all
the business publications for many years and have cheered you on with the
innovative business model you have constructed at Enron.

The reason for my e-mail is to recommend Ginny's brother-in-law, Don Booker,
for Employment at Enron.  I have known Don since our days at Vanderbilt many
years ago.  He is a chemical engineer and has been with Scott Paper and with
SAPPI, the company that purchased one on their mills in Muskegon, Michigan
almost since graduation.  He is the pulp and utilities mill manager and has
experience in coal, gas and bio-mass co-generation.  He will take early
retirement from SAPPI soon and is looking to continue his career in the
power generation area.  Since your company is an innovator in this area I
thought you might be able to refer Don to someone in your organization that
could be of help.

On a personal level, I can highly recommend Don as a dedicated,  hard
working and intelligent employee with the technical and management knowledge
to make good business decisions.  We have had many talks over the years
about his management philosophy and I have always come away being impressed
with both his management and leadership skills.  Don conducts himself with a
high degree of integrity which is an essential leadership requirement.

Ken, as you can tell, I am highly recommending Don for a job at Enron.  If
you have an opening it would be in Enron's best interests to consider him.
If I can be of further help give me a call at (407) 293-4000 or e-mail me at
RDF@Finfrock.cc <mailto:RDF@Finfrock.cc> .  You can contact Don directly at
(616) 846-3177 or e-mail at  DBooker@charterMI.net.

Thanks for your attention Ken, and congratulations on your impressive story
at Enron.

Sincerely,


Bob Finfrock

"Anthrax and Politics","============================================================
Greenfield at Large: Weeknights, 11:00 p.m. ET
Wednesday, January 09, 2002
============================================================

We're dealing today with the possible returns of two
phenomena that may cause some folks to lose sleep --
anthrax and politics.

Which is worse we'll leave for you to decide.

There's no indication that a bioterror attack is under
way or about to be. Instead, we're focusing tonight on
what happens IF it is. Is the U.S. any better prepared
now than it was in October? What happened to all the talk
about ensuring that communities are ready to respond? Has
the money been allocated? Plans formulated? We'll ask one
of the top advisors to Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge,
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.

Then there's politics. The November elections and the
ailing economy have -- despite September 11's aftermath of
unity -- led to both parties sharpening their rhetorical
swords. And they're starting to get pulled from their
sheaths more often. This past weekend President Bush and
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle took aim at each other.

Is this what the country needs right now? Or is it a
healthy sign of a return to the normal give-and-take of
America's political system? We'll debate these questions
tonight with Susan Page of USA Today, Slate.com's Jacob
Weisberg and CNN Contributor Jonah Goldberg. We hope
you'll join us, no matter what party you belong to.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.

Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month

All, 

Attached, for your information,  is a 2 page financial and statistical fact sheet for EGM (as a consolidated unit and for each business unit).  I obviously would have liked our gross margin and EBIT to be a lot larger but all the other facts show enormous growth and progress.   I wanted to at least get it into your hands in case you needed a quick reference.

Ken,
 
My line manager in London was Steven Roselius. He  is a good guy with a family and a loyal company man. He is a Texan and over in  London on a two year contract. Now he has just rented his house out in Houston  on a six month contract so has no where to live and no job. He has lost 100K in  Enron stock. If you can offer him any help please do so, he is under a lot of  stress which he is taking quietly.

"FW: Attention Body Shop Members -- Body Shop Closure","Ken, 
    I realize that times are tough, but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees.  Have you ever gone down to the Body Shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes?  We've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale, but this is a new low.  Are you going to do anything about it?  I think that a lot of people would like to know.

"Emergency Consideration of Authorization to Execute an Option to 	Purchase Strategic Properties Adjacent to the University","President Swygert asked I forward to you the information below regarding the
acquisition of property by the University.

The University has a time-sensitive opportunity to acquire five parcels
currently owned by a local Community Development Corporation (CDC). Four of
the five properties are on Georgia Avenue Corridor encompassed by our
LeDroit Park Initiative. Three of the parcels are of strategic importance as
they are across the street from the Howard University/Shaw Metro station and
comprise the southern gateway to the University.
It is the University's intention to convert the largest of the properties (a
new facility built as a nursing home) into a residence hall. It should be
noted that the regulatory process to change the use can take a year to
complete.  The matter is time-sensitive because the CDC is on the verge of
defaulting on two of their loans and the drop-dead date from the lender for
their largest parcel is COB tomorrow.
Chairman Savage asked that the Executive Committee be convened by
teleconference Thursday, November 15, 2001, at 10:30 a.m. to discuss the
resolution described below.  Call-in information is provided to facilitate
your participation if you have availability.  The dial-in number for the
call is 1-800-272-4152.  The Host code number is 922892 and the Participant
code number is 653172.  Of course, should you have difficulty accessing the
call, do not hesitate to call the office at (202) 806-2250.

Considering the shortness of notice for this meeting, if you are not
available for the teleconference, you may indicate your approval or
disapproval as appropriate below and return via electronic mail or facsimile
to (202) 332-2961.

RESOLVED THAT, the President and the Officers of the University are hereby
authorized to execute an Agreement of Purchase and Sale for the acquisition
of certain parcels of property located in the District of Columbia, more
particularly described as 1800 7th Street N.W.; 1850 7th Street, N.W. 2035
2nd Street N.W.; 1900 7th Street, N.W.; and 2908-2918 Georgia Avenue, N.W.,
Provided That, as part of the acquisition process the University shall
conduct a thorough ""due diligence"" review of the parcels and shall not
conclude any sale for the purchase of the parcels until the results of such
due diligence are presented to the Committee and the Committee approves of
all elements of the proposed transaction, including but not limited to, the
sales price and the terms and conditions of available financing; and
Provided Further, that the President in his discretion may incur such costs
as he deems appropriate and fair to preserve the right of the University to
purchase such parcels pending the Committee's consideration of the due
diligence review.

"Important News For Our Texas Customers","June 8, 2001


Dear LINDA LAY:

We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up
with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program.
Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage
of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.

As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed
of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot
program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility
Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly
over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches
from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower,
will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for
the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program.

Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This
requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader:
http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf

If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow
instructions for free download:
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_46_1267

What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service
will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then,
your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity,
uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll
still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were
promised when you signed up.

There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the
Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your
household with electric service after July 6th.

In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the
effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or

"FW: Sacramento Bee Special On Electricity Crisis","FYI

Subject: FW: Sacramento Bee Special On Electricity Crisis



FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a ""small"" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.

Best,

"Fwd: Merger Impact on Employee/Retiree Stock Options","

I worked for Enron and Internorth for about 24 years, was elected to the
Chairman's Roundtable in 1999, and was severed with early retirement in
February 2001.

When I retired in February my 10,000+ stock options had a value of about
$265,000.  At the price of the Enron/Dynegy merger, $10.41 per share, my
options have zero value.  I know that I am not the only employee/retiree in
this position.

The 1994 Stock Option Plan, as I read it, does not address what happens when
a merger occurs that is approved by the board of directors.  What happens
now?  Do the options die?  Do the options get converted to Dynegy stock
options in some fashion?  I am interested in the answer but not optimistic.

Over the years I and other employees were encouraged/enticed into taking part
of our annual bonuses in the form of options.  In taking these options, I
relied on the integrity of the Enron executive leadership that their
statements of the good financial shape of Enron were true.

In retrospect it appears I should have cashed the options in when I had the
chance.  Even in early August I could have got close to $100,000 for my
options.  But again, I believed the statement that there was no bad news
coming.

The company has preached the values; R.I.C.E.- Respect, Integrity,
Communication, and Excellence.  Are these only platitudes or were you serious
when you honored me for practicing them?

Respectfully,

J. Douglas McNeilly

With the updated mutual fund NAV, the Partnership's Bank of  America LOC is actually $112k available as of the close May 25, which was  more than the estimated $25k-$50k.

Subject: Update - May 25, 2001
On Thursday, May 25 you were repaid $2,535,786.72  from the refinance of David's home ($1mm) and my home ($1,535,786).   We forwarded the funds to paydown your personal Bank of Amercia (BA) LOC.   The Family Partnership had to borrow from your personal line at BA $200,000 to  cover the $588k cash call for SRE properties.  With today's closing prices,  the Family Partnership's available BA line is between $25k-$50, which is an  estimate because mutual funds don't post their NAVs until around 5pm (Central  time).  That makes the Partnership's  total payable to KLL/LPL  personal line at $1,303,500.
 
I contacted the guys regarding the BBT Fund (Bass  family).  Per our conversation, I told them that the timing was bad,  but we did not want to miss out before they close the fund.  I indicated  that our initial investment would be the following: KLL/LPL personal $250,000;  KLL & LPL Investments, Ltd. $100,000; Foundation ? (possibly  $100,000).  The initial investment amount for the partnership, and  possibly the foundation, are about as low as we can go if we want to  get into the fund.  I am aware that the Foundation is waiting to as  long as possible to pay out any contributions os I wasn't sure if we wanted to  make something happen there.  Also, I indicated that we would prefer  to fund as late as possible, which looks like July  .  If we decide on doing something in the foundation they  have an Offshore Partnership to eliminate the tax implications of UBIT.   The Offshore Partnership is run exactly the same as the Onshore version, but is  unitized and pays a dividend rather than distributions to the investors.   Let me know if the amounts (above) to invest are okay with you and if you want  anything in the Foundation.

"Words of Encouragement from one employee - Please Read This Mr. Lay","Mr. Lay,

It seems to have become fashionable to bash you and the other executives as things have become challenging at Enron.  I just wanted to let you know that there are some people who still care about Enron and are still thankful for what you have done over the past 15 years.  I have been completely distraught at the speed with which my coworkers have thrown in the towel and have essentially given up.  I urge you to continue to fight for Enron.  True, it may take another 15 years to get back to a leading company, but do not give up the fight.  You have made Enron a wonderful place to work and I know that Enron will survive.  It would be a tragedy if the innovative thinking made famous by Enron were to be discarded and corporate America returned to a status quo mentality.

I have been informed that I am on the list of those to be laid off because I am in a non-core business, and I agree.  I loved having the job, but desperate times call for desperate measures and I understand the need to focus.  I am tired of my fellow coworkers quitting, complaining, and giving up.  There are plenty of people that will join you in the fight, I hope that you are able to weed out the quitters and get a group of people together who will fight for the Enron way of doing business.  

I applaud you for your accomplishments over the past 15 years in building an incredible company - a company that will survive, a company that will once again thrive, and a company that will prosper well into the future.

Good luck and please don't give up,
Zach Streight

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"AEI Board--Sidney Taurel","Dear Mitch and Ken,

I wanted you to know that I am approaching Sidney Taurel about joining the AEI Board of Trustees (letter pasted below).  If he should ask your opinion about this, I hope you will be brutally candid, and therefore enthusiastic and encouraging.

Best,

Chris
-------------------------------------------
October 19, 2001

Mr. Sidney Taurel
Chairman, President, and CEO
Eli Lilly and Company
Lilly Corporate Center
Indianapolis, IN 46285

Dear Sidney:

My call the other day was to ask if you would consider joining the Board of Trustees of the American Enterprise Institute.  AEI is prospering and is doing a great deal of research pertinent to your immediate business interests.  We are also leading in many other fields of economics, politics, security, and social welfare that I believe you would find fascinating and important.  We have an outstanding Board, and will elect several additional trustees in advance of our annual meeting on December 7, 2001.

I understand you will be back in Indianapolis on Monday, October 22?when I will be out of the country, to return on Thursday, October 25.  I will call you then to discuss, but thought it would be helpful to send you some background information.  Enclosed are a list of our current trustees, a list of upcoming Board dates, an outline of our current research agenda, our 2000 annual report (the 2001 report comes out next month), and a few other things.

I will tell you more about the Board schedule when I call.  The AEI Board is not an honorific but it is not a heavy time commitment either; our trustees are all very busy people, and we are good at economizing on their time.

We have many titans of industry and finance on the Board, but all of them are here because of personal qualities: character, intellect, and sympathy for AEI's purposes.  Those are the reasons I am approaching you, and why I think you would find AEI a worthwhile engagement.  So I hope you will give the idea serious consideration?or at least keep an open mind until we talk!

With best wishes,

Yours cordially,

/s/ Chris DeMuth

offices and I know I would qualify to do something even short term.  Can you
provide to me a few contacts to get in the door, please....?  Any contacts
in Chicago would be great.

If you need to verify my performance with ECS please contact Lance Jameson.

"","Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.

"October London meeting","    Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them
after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very
preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK
colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting
your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions.
I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening
dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the
facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip
for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative.
We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the
viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political
side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations
(characterized as ""a VERY smart guy on climate""):
Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC.  Has been on UK
climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful).
Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out;
big figure in Europe).
Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and
can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or
Brenton).
    Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam
Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul
also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the
French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good
presenter and a good economist.
    WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET
ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON
THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A
USEFUL TOPIC.
    I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: ""I remember
promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be
interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council
about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly
on the Continent, to the U.S. model.  I got the following names from Jay
Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty
Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as
possibilities.  Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of
Henkel, very senior),  Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam
Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse
Coopers - would be the most junior of the three.  I don't personally know any
of the three.""
    Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a
two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a
run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better
understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face.
    1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great
interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We
might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if
allowed to do so.
    2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above).
    3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy.
    4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk).
    5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and
how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just
joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way.
    6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If
this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers.
    7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of
US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me,
we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and
the inventor of the ""climate change levy"" that is driving industry in this
country nuts.
    Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with
Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum,
which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve
and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with
Ken at his convenience.

"Support","Mr Lay:

It is easy for me to understand the feelings of anger of many of my co-workers and peers as the turn of events at Enron has probably taken the worst possible route.

I do not understand, however, why so many people blame you personally for the whole process. This is a business issue, and as a business failure, the ""fault"" if there is such thing, belongs to no one. It's just a fact of life that businesses fail, and businesses succeed. Enron was always on top, and when that was the case, although people recognized your leadership, the common knowledge was that it was all a ""team effort"". 
I find it unfair and unhealthy to hear people's currennt comments about upper management including, particularly,  yourself. I  have the sense that for many people it has become a personal thing, and that should definitely should not be the case.

As a personal note, I have to say that I feel for you. Seeing what you built for many years crumble to dust like Enron has, and then leave with that legacy must not be easy. The closest analogy I can think of is the Concorde. There are many parallels among the Concorde and Enron. Both were a marvel of innovativeness, technology and talent, each in its own time. After Concorde's first crash last year, it was imperative that it fly again. It would have been a bitter and undignified end for such a graceful, advanced machine if it did not. Many engineers, originally involved in the process of building Concorde in the 60's and 70's came out of retirement to participate in its modification process. And now, it is flying again, with pride. 

Given the pragmatic and cold facts of business, I do not think you will have that opportunity. Whether Enron flies again  (and I'm sure it will) you will not be a participant to its re-birth. Even though for the past 2 months you have spent countless sleepless nights, away from your family and trying effortlessly to get the best possible solution, you will not be here to see the fruits of your work. For some time to come, people will associate you with Enron's demise, and will blame you for it. Few will remember that it was you who made Enron what it was, in our best days. I believe strongly that that is not fair.

Thanks for what you have done, for the past 25 years and the past 3 weeks. You are probably one of the people most affected by this, at least emotionally. Thanks for your courage in keeping us updated, through voicemails and e-mails, knowing that most of them will be deleted, just by the mention of ""office of the chairman"". And please keep in mind that there are a lot of people out there that recognize what you've done, your recent efforts, your strength and presence of mind in these tough times.

My only hope is that you will find solace and tranquility, in knowing that what you should remember of your tenure at Enron is all the years you were at its helm, not the last 6 months and horrible 3 weeks.

Martin Gonzalez

I just got a note that you sent me regarding a letter from Tadaaki Hashida at NHS requesting that you speak
at their conference (unfortunately it took almost two weeks to get from your desk to mine).  Mike McConnel has the Global Markets lead there (with Joe Hirl reporting to Mike and Joe serves as country manager).  The business that I have is a small metals team and the power development company of 16 employees working 
under the joint venture company ePower.  Nick O'Day runs this company for me.

Mike is the key guy to determine if your time would be well spent from his business perspective but relative to my businesses,
I doubt if it would be the best use of your time.  You may be aware that Mike's team is in the midst of negotiating a larger deal
with Nisho Iwai.  The success of this negotiation is likely to shed a great deal of light on our broader business prospects in Japan.

Ken, please read

My prayers go out with you as grab the wheel of this ship and try to get it back onto smoother waters However, I am currently enduring my own issues in house. I am sending this note to point out that some basic values in our organization are lacking. I only want to point out to you my example of the ambiguity of excellence. I attempted to attend the all employee meeting but was turned away at the door. The reason was I lost my badge during a business trip last week. A Mr. Alex Varez (director security) informed me that no one can enter the meeting without an Enron ID badge. So I waited and watched. I watched as three gentleman were let in by a Mr. Steve Kane or Kean. I questioned Mr. Varez and a Mr. Mark Jeffries as to what criterion did the rules change. He stated Mr. Kane/Kean vouched for the gentlemen. Of course I left and hurried back to listen to your assessment and write this e-mail. The fundamentals are often waived just like the entry of the three gentlemen who where allowed in the meeting. The sad part is that I have been here almost five years and shook the hands of 5 people entering the meeting all who could have vouched for me. However, in this example knowing the right person mattered. The rules did not apply equally. I said all this to say now more than ever you need to drive home our values. And force a wholesome discipline throughout our organization. It appears that the management team is looking at external indicators instead of internal indicators. If we feel our values are being delivered in-house then the collective ""we"" will change external perceptions. 

Here is some food for thought that will assist in changing the direction of Enron. I do not know if you are a God fearing man. However, my intuition says you are. The foundation of the EBN is on blessed ground, the earth is old church property. I don't know if you ever considered that but I am relatively sure that it is fact. Any business within the walls on this ground is in a better position to prosper. I am not sure if the new building is on the blessed grounds. It could be beneficial to have the new building blessed. An old tradition for future success. For me it is the basic premise for success as we move forward.

To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Daily Update


Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Dear All,

	As many of you may already know, I will be moving to the Power Trading group.  My new position will allow me to combine my experience in derivatives, as well as my knowledge of the power industry.  

?	My derivatives experience:  Recently, I worked on Credit Derivatives pricing models for Enron Credit.  In addition, I worked as a derivatives structurer at Investment Banque BNP Paribas in London, where I also obtained my licenses in Securities, Regulations and Derivatives.  In addition, I spent my summers in Associateships and consulting positions in derivatives pricing at Salomon Brothers and Charles Schwab. Finally, I conducted real options academic research at MIT.

?	My power experience:  My Harvard PhD thesis in Applied Mathematics had applications to the ""transient stability analysis of electrical power systems.""  In addition, my London Business School MBA thesis was entitled ""Day-Ahead Lunch-Time Electricity Demand Forecasting:  Applications to Electricity and Weather Derivatives"".  


I really enjoyed my time working in the Research Group, as well as my time supporting Enron Credit.  

Looking forward to working with you in the future!

1.    SBSC  PRESIDENT TESTIFIES BEFORE CONGRESS ON BEST POLICIES FOR ECONOMY AND SMALL  BUSINESS
 
SBSC President Darrell McKigney testified  before the House Small Business Committee on October 10.  McKigney explained the important role  that small business plays in the economy, and laid out a pro-small business  policy agenda that featured speeding up and making permanent the tax cuts  passed earlier this year; cutting or eliminating the capital gains tax;  granting the President trade promotion authority; and enacting an energy plan  that frees up domestic energy producers.

2.   SBSC  ADDRESSES MEDIA ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC  ISSUES
 
On October 11, SBSC Chairman Karen  Kerrigan, President Darrell McKigney, and Chief Economist Raymond J. Keating  discussed the state of small business and the economy in a tele-conference  call with reporters from Newsweek,  Business Week, Newsday, Human Events, CNSNews.com, Baltimore Sun, Arizona  Republic and the Orange County  Register.
 
 
2.    FREE  TRADE FOR SMALL BUSINESS, TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY FOR THE  PRESIDENT
 
SBSC chief economist Raymond J. Keating  wrote a new report--""International Trade: The Business of Small Business""-that  explains the importance of free and open trade for our economy and for the  small business community.  Keating  lays out a pro-free trade agenda, featuring passage of trade promotion  authority for the President.
 
SBSC's report ""International Trade: The  Business of Small Business"" can be downloaded from the front page at http://www.sbsc.org/under the ""21st  Century Small Business Policy Series.""
 
3.    SBSC  AND OTHER GROUPS URGE CONGRESS TO GRANT TPA TO PRESIDENT  BUSH
 
SBSC Chairman Karen Kerrigan signed an  October 9 letter to Congress urging passage of trade promotion authority (TPA)  for the President.  In part, the  letter said: ""World trade is increasingly important to small business.   Nearly one-third of all U.S. merchandise export sales -- the stuff whose  labels read, ""Made in America""-- are produced by companies with less than 500  people on their payrolls.  Two-thirds of the firms participating in the  export economy actually have less than 20 employees. What's more, the overall  value of small-business exports has increased by 300 percent since the  mid-1990s, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.  Between  1987 and 1997, the number of U.S. small business exporters tripled from 65,900  to 202,185, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.  That number  will grow substantially if President Bush were given Trade Promotion  Authority.""

In an October 5 letter to Congress, SBSC  Chairman Karen Kerrigan and representatives from other groups wrote: ""While it  is still uncertain whether the Senate will consider comprehensive energy  legislation, we are writing to alert you to our concern about a specific  provision that could undermine the current work of the Congress to bring  stability and growth to our nation's economy.  As this important  legislation is being debated, we urge you to proceed with caution in imposing  new burdens on businesses and consumers through mandates and regulations.   Specifically, we are asking that you reject the onerous ""one-watt""  provisions similar to those slipped into the House Energy bill, H.R. 4.   If enacted, these one-watt restrictions will cost consumers money and  convenience, place undue burdens on businesses, while creating a new layer of  government bureaucracy.""

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

"FW: Enron - Honoring our loved ones","Mr. Lay,

I had forwarded the terrible news of our loss of Nick Humber, Director of Enron Wind, to my sister in Belton, TX.  I knew she had a website set up for a memorial, but I thought the offer by a friend of hers to make plaques to honor the victims was super sweet.  As she gets her site updated, would you like a link for it sent to you so that others at Enron can see the dedications and artistic handiwork by people who are showing their American spirit?

"values","
  
Dear Ken,
            I would like to apologize for not responding to the survey at the beginning of September. It wasn't a statement or anything. We were just up to our ears in a project that had to go out on the Wednesday following Labor Day. And the ""well, I'll fill it out during lunch"" is never a really good idea. Lunchtime disappears so quickly.
            So by way of apology I am sending you this letter with some thoughts and observations about life at Enron. I hope you don't think I'm ""line jumping"" by doing this. But I've observed that surveys often get you information you want, not information you need. The numbers on the survey look good. But there's always room for improvement.
            I'm very pleased that you're once again involved in the day-to-day operations. I'm also very glad that you're emphasizing our values. I have to admit that they weren't the reason I came to Enron-I needed a job-but as soon as I was here, they became a major reason for staying. It's not just another job, if the values are believed and followed. The perks are nice, but I bet that the values have as much to do with our being named a great place to work as anything else.
            I wonder, though, if everyone shares my-our-view. There was a rumor going around the day after the all-employee meeting that senior management was not happy when you announced we were going to reaffirm our values. That strikes me as a little too soon after the meeting to be totally credible, and I really can't picture senior management telling people what they really think about our values or anything, if they really think that way.
            I also don't doubt that it's true. We seem to have gone from a company that treasures its intellectual capital and people to one where reorganizations and ""disappearances"" are more the order of the day. Although it's gotten a little better, our values right now seem to be FUD-a computer industry term for fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Many people-myself included-spend a lot of time looking over our shoulders as we go through seemingly constant reorganization and reevaluation, waiting for the other shoe to drop-on us. Rumors (the whole unit is being phased out) were rampant, and it didn't help when the PEP scores came out with no indication why (really low) scores were given, or, more importantly, how we could go about improving our performance.
            This doesn't strike me as the best way to increase productivity or esprit d' corps.
            We need to add value to the values. As part of my initial orientation, Joe Sutton asked us to define and give examples of our values. A couple of months later, Jeff Skilling addressed ""Enron at a Glance."" He spent serious time explaining the importance of the values, too. Hey, I thought, these guys are serious about this stuff. 
            Since then, though, all my reinforcement about our values comes from the elevator, right after The Building Guy.
            Last spring, we were all trooped over to the Doubletree to see the harassment players, costing a fair chunk of time and money, I'm guessing. So which, in my puny little brain, is more important? Where the dollars go, or the occasional reference in what somebody considers otherwise dead time?
            There are ways we can adjust. I would like to suggest two possibilities. First, I would like to propose a refresher course in our values. Take time out of our days. Get in experts. Hire a hall. Give us cookies. Heck, maybe even lunch. Make the bigwigs in each unit do off-sites. They like off-sites. 
            We'll get the idea. This is important.
            One other notion. You may recall bumper stickers that read, ""Commit Random Acts of Kindness."" I would like to suggest a ""Random Acts of Values"" award. Actually, I wouldn't want to make it an award. ""Random Acts of Values"" recognition? captured? Maybe. 
            I'll keep doing the day in and the day out, because it's the right thing to do, not because of an award. But recognizing what we think is important might give a boost to some other people. It will at least raise the profile. And it would also tell us something if the recognition was going to everyone except senior management. I'd really hate to see my rumormonger proven true.
            I know we have the Chairman's Award. But I'm no Mark Herada. I would need two lifetimes to do half of what he's done. The Chairman's Award is really important, and I will nominate someone. People like Mark truly deserve it, and I know a couple. But it's one award, once a year. 
            We should recognize little moments. I have no idea how we would capture them, and I don't know what to do with a guy who is really respectful today and tomorrow resumes being a jerk. But we can figure out something. 
            And I'm suspecting that you really wouldn't be terribly bent out of shape if you had to recognize 20,000 values moments, especially if they were one per person.
 
Sincerely,
John

"Follow Up to Sept. 17 Board Meeting","
Following up on our discussions at the September 17 Board meeting, Wednesday we communicated our earnings expectations for the 3rd & 4th Quarters, 2001, 2002, and 2003 to investment analysts.  This communication was as we discussed at the Board meeting, but in addition we chose to communicate the special charges that we will be incurring in the 3rd & 4th Quarters.  Since it was relatively close to our earnings announcement [planned for October 18], we decided that it would be best to disclose the special charges now rather than waiting. 
Attached is an updated summary of the special charges.  They have changed somewhat since the Board as we raised  the total charge for the third quarter by $.04 per share to $.14.   Specifically, in the Restructuring and Asset Impairment category the charge increased by $.03 primarily due to the required write off of  manufacturing facilities in Brazil.  We also added $.01 related to Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt as our open market repurchase activity resulted in the acquisition of a higher mix of longer-term issues, thus increasing the cost somewhat. 
The reaction by analysts to these charges is that they are truly one time items.  Therefore, they will be normalized out and analysts will view the 3rd Quarter results as being $.66 per share. 
Even though we lowered expectations for the fourth quarter and 2002, overall the communication was accepted positively. In particular, investors appreciated our willingness and need to spend more in 2002 to maximize the sales of the five new products we expect to launch in 2001 and 2002. We closed Thursday at just under $79, down about $3.75 from our close on Tuesday. This was a much better result than we anticipated. 
If you have any questions about this, please let me know.

Mr. Lay,

I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of me and my coworkers here at Enron.  In light of the recent events that have happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking.  I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge, so I had to get a guest pass, this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time.  However, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn't been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here at Enron.  Can you see where I am going with this?  

Anyway, I'm a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold.  I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it.  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody.

Sincerely,

Aaron Berutti

What the polls say ...  Week 5 (12/3 to 12/19 )

M U is ranked number 3 in the ESPN coaches poll, number 2 in the better poll (AP).

Our Saturday opponent,  previous match:

Iowa is ranked number 11 with a 6 win and 2 loss record.   One of those losses was a defeat at the hands of M U on the day before Thanksgiving.

Was it a close game?

Let's step back in time ...Iowa is up 77-71. Kareem Rush ties it with TWO three pointers.  Now 41 Seconds left. Clarence Gilbert drives down court, shoots for two, and is fouled.

Gilbert at the free throw line. Iowa calls time out. Ready Gilbert ?..No Iowa calls a second time out. Gilbert misses the first shot. Iowa calls another time out.

        With eight - tenths of a second remaining Gilbert makes the free throw.

        Final Score M U 78 , the other team 77.

More History:

Last week the headline was Stokes Sinks St. Louis with his final shot at the buzzer.
Final Score, MU 69, St. Louis 67

And last nights game excerpt from the Maneater at http://www.themaneater.com/story.cgi?id=12400

'TIGERS TAME JAGUARS

Coach Quin Snyder said he wanted more output from his preseason All-American Kareem Rush. He got it from Rush, but he got even more from his lone senior, Clarence Gilbert.

Rush scored 25 points in 22 minutes, and Gilbert added 29 in 23 en route to a 117-67 victory over the Southern Jaguars. The 117 points were sixth for MU all-time high scores, as the Tigers scored 100 points
or more for the third consecutive home game.'

"draft employee memo","Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Update - May 25, 2001","
On Thursday, May 25 you were repaid $2,535,786.72  from the refinance of David's home ($1mm) and my home ($1,535,786).   We forwarded the funds to paydown your personal Bank of Amercia (BA) LOC.   The Family Partnership had to borrow from your personal line at BA $200,000 to  cover the $588k cash call for SRE properties.  With today's closing prices,  the Family Partnership's available BA line is between $25k-$50, which is an  estimate because mutual funds don't post their NAVs until around 5pm (Central  time).  That makes the Partnership's  total payable to KLL/LPL  personal line at $1,303,500.
 
I contacted the guys regarding the BBT Fund (Bass  family).  Per our conversation, I told them that the timing was bad,  but we did not want to miss out before they close the fund.  I indicated  that our initial investment would be the following: KLL/LPL personal $250,000;  KLL & LPL Investments, Ltd. $100,000; Foundation ? (possibly  $100,000).  The initial investment amount for the partnership, and  possibly the foundation, are about as low as we can go if we want to  get into the fund.  I am aware that the Foundation is waiting to as  long as possible to pay out any contributions os I wasn't sure if we wanted to  make something happen there.  Also, I indicated that we would prefer  to fund as late as possible, which looks like July  .  If we decide on doing something in the foundation they  have an Offshore Partnership to eliminate the tax implications of UBIT.   The Offshore Partnership is run exactly the same as the Onshore version, but is  unitized and pays a dividend rather than distributions to the investors.   Let me know if the amounts (above) to invest are okay with you and if you want  anything in the Foundation.

"""Humility"" Value","

Ken:

This idea might be more appropriate for the Management Conference rather than tomorrow, but I suggest a fifth value or at least implicit emphasis of a value within our values--humility.

There are different dictionary definitions of the term, but the one that fits Enron best is ""not proud or haughty; not arrogant or assertive.""  We want to be proud but not haughty, arrogant, or assertive, so there is a fine line with the term.

""Humility"" is really a necessary characteristic of any firm participating in the ""creative destruction"" of open markets.  It reflects the fact that 1) the market and exogenous events are orders of magnitude greater than any one company, individual, or institution, and 2) a company's performance, no matter how positive, is just a temporary, even fleeting, evaluation of consumers, investors, employees, and the general public.  After all, everyone has choices.

The humility value has been one of the most important for Charles Koch of Koch Industries.  Koch has certainly had their share of problems and has a very different business model from Enron.  But what is important is that Charles is a very serious student of market-based ideas and sees this value coming straight from Joseph Schumpeter, F. A. Hayek, and others in the free market vanguard.  I wholly agree.

Subject:	Salary

Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson

"RE: Non-Core Business Response for Consideration","Ken,  Thanks for your message.  Communication, even if it is brief, from you is absolutely critical at this time.  While Enron has a very tough road ahead, I think I can speak for several people on my team that we are supportive of the non-Dynegy route regardless of the option we ultimately plan to pursue.  I know the best thing I can do for Enron is to sell our remaining assets to either BG or another counter party.  I am committed to this task and we will continue to focus on BG, but we need to be prepared that it may be necessary to take a different path to sell the India E&P assets.  In a strange way, the termination of the Dynegy merger may actually help the E&P sale because it takes away the automatic loss of operatorship ONGC was using as leverage.  Depending on Enron Corp.'s plans, we may have a much stronger message to play with our Indian partners and the GOI.  They should be concerned that we will keep ownership and operatorship long term, and they should also be concerned that we will not want to spend the capital to expand the projects (something the GOI/ONGC really wants to do).  After you announce Corp's plan, I will go to India and meet with our partners and the GOI in this regard.      

Based on your note below and earlier comments, I know the trading business is a key component to your future core operations.  I am supportive of that decision because I saw the enormous value it can generate in the right circumstances.  As I have mentioned before, I think the company should sell businesses such as the E&P company that are non-core.  It is the right thing to do, especially in these circumstances.  However, some of the non-core businesses generate good cashflow (like the E&P company) and we have to be careful in this environment to make sure the company supports the ""valuable"" non-core businesses until they can be monetized.  

I also know most of your senior advisors are disciples of the trading  business.  Because they grew up in that environment, they are very comfortable and knowledgeable of this business model and there will be tremendous pressure to maintain certain trading activities or people for the future even when the near-term value is questionable.  I hope somebody at the table asks the question, if we focus our limited financial resources to maintain this future benefit, have we lost a ""valuable near-term non-core"" resource?  I know these decisions are not easy or clear-cut,  but in this new paradigm this could happen pretty easily since most of the players at the table do not understand Enron's non-core businesses or what it takes to optimize near-term value. This comment is not intended to offend anybody, but it is a concern.

For example,  Enron made financial commitments of $10.5 million to our staff to maintain operations and sell our assets.  We've sold everything except EOGIL and we have negotiated mutually acceptable PSA's with two different companies for EOGIL, but due to some extra-ordinary circumstances, this has proven to be a tough sale.  As I mentioned in the first paragraph, I think we can get there, but it may take a little more time and we need to maintain staff during the interim. 

I recognize everything has changed due to recent events.  I am not asking for a handout because that is the way it was before or anything like that.  My point is the company will have to make tough decisions regarding which individuals to incentivize and I believe the existing commitments to the E&P team should be maintained even though this is a non-core business.  Reaffirming the company's commitment to the $10.5 million will give us a good probability of keeping enough of the core staff to achieve our goals and monetize the assets soon. I recognize that $10.5 million is not a trivial sum of money, but without these individuals we stand to lose $50 to $100 million in the next 12 months; therefore, I have believe this is the right decision for Enron.

I believe EGEP is one of the ""valuable"" non-core businesses, but if this becomes a point of controversy I would at least like the opportunity to present my case in person to one of you. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my note. 
Jeff

Subject:	Update


As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.  Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.  As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.  

In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.  At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.  Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.  Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs. 

We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.  This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.

I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.  Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.  All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.

Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.  We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.  As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.  Thank you.

Ken

"Just a note","Dear Mr. Lay,
 
First of all....thanks.  I haven't been here as long as you, but I've been here a while...14yr.  It's been a great experience and I want you to know how much I appreciate you and your leadership.
 
I too will be here, as you say, ""until they run me off"" or until we get through the other side.  It's a tough situation and I guess there's no guarantee we'll make it but it won't be because we didn't give it all we had or that we didn't do the right thing.  
 
You take care of yourself,
Greg

"Goodbye Mr. Lay","Dear Mr. Lay:

You may not actually take time to read this email, but it will make me feel better having sent it.  I started with Enron 2 1/2 years ago in the ENA Volume Management Group.  Even after having 3 managers in the group, my reviews were outstanding, and after 1 1/2 years in the group, I decided to spread my wings.  I wanted to make a difference at Enron and I decided to take a position with Enron Global Markets, a growing and prosperous group at the time.  Once again, I was passed around through various managers, 3 to be exact, however I still received outstanding reviews.  With all of my reviews, always came the promise of being promoted with the next one.  However, with the last mid-year review, my boss knew that the time had come - but he encouraged me to wait until year-end, as my raise and bonus would be much better that way.  I knew that he was looking out for my best interest, as I am sure the other 5 managers had done along the way as well.  

Unfortunately, the company took a turn for the worse and I could soon see that my future with this company that I sincerely loved was coming to an end.  I was one of the lucky ones, as I was not severed.  I knew that since I was a ???survivor???, all the hard work had been recognized and that is why I was considered a ???critical employee???.  But the longer I stayed, the more the uncertainty of the company became abundantly apparent to me and I knew I needed to do something to protect my career and myself.  I decided to seek employment outside of Enron.  I was fortunate.  I found something immediately.  I honestly believe it was because of my experience at Enron, along with having some of the best mangers and directors as mentors, that I was able to find such an opportunity.  

I knew that the day would come that I would have to give notice, but I was hoping and praying that Enron Management would not do me wrong, as so many of my friends had been.  I knew that Enron would be fair and pay me my three weeks of vacation that I was due.  I was mistaken.  When it all came down to it, Enron in the end looked out for itself.  After receiving the run around, I was eventually told that I would not receive any of my vacation, although the rules had never been revised from previous years and nothing was ever clearly communicated from Human Resources.  

I worked my ass off for Enron for 2 ?? years, and this company does not even have the decency to pay me my vacation.  I do know that my managers and directors received 90 day retention packages, that amounted to more that my annual compensation.  I know that some people within my own Enron Company were severed once it was determined that they had a job safely outside of Enron ??"" that way they were assured $4,500.  I also know that when notice was given for some employees, they were immediately severed, so that their benefits would not roll into the next month.  Again, they received their $4,500 and had a job lined up to immediately go to.  What are the rules?  How should these situations have been handled?  Should not each employee be treated fairly?  

Time and time again, I stood behind Enron and you, Mr. Lay.  I honestly thought I would leave supporting Enron.  I thought it was the tragic mistake and greed of a FEW employees who took this company down.  However, based on my recent treatment, I have come to realize that there are more than a few greedy people in this company ??"" ones that have yet to be recognized.  All I wanted was the one extra check that was due me.  I earned my vacation.  I worked hard and supported this company ??"" and I am left with nothing, while management is left with thousands upon thousands of dollars.  I HAD to leave Enron to protect my future.  I never thought the day would come when my words regarding Enron would become resentful.  

Sincerely,

Diana Monaghan

"Reaction to Ken Lay Letter to Indian Prime Minister","Ken,

I wanted to update you on the reaction to your most recent letter to the Indian Prime Minister. You recall that we recommended you write again to the Prime Minister and express disappointment at the lack of progress since your July trip and your August letter containing our offer to sell our equity at costs. I believe writing this letter was the proper response but only time will tell what reaction (if any) finally comes from the Indian government.

I think you should know about the press coverage of the letter, just in case the letter were to come up in any conversation you might have with someone from the US government. I am not anticipating this at all, but I would not want you to be unprepared about the press coverage. The US embassy over here is very much up to speed.  I met again with Ambassador Blackwill on Tuesday of this week and gave him a general update on the current status. His view is that it is very difficult in the post-Sept. 11 environment to get anyone in Delhi or Washington to pay attention to economic matters such as Dabhol, but he is trying as best he can. He is meeting with Brajesh Mishra (Prime Minister's principal secretary) on Saturday, who will have just returned from Washington meetings with Ms. Rice, among others, principally to discuss anti-terrorist matters. John Hardy of our DC office briefed the State Department last week in advance of these meetings, and we are awaiting to hear any discussion or outcome regarding Dabhol.

Regarding press coverage of the letter, as we anticipated, the entire letter was leaked to the press. Several articles have appeared that describe the ""harshly worded"" letter and many articles have quoted verbatim sections from the letter. The Wall Street Journal article from last week presented the letter fairly, and I think it came out rather sympathetic to our position. The Indian papers have been neutral to negative. For example, an editorial (reprinted below) was in Wednesday's Financial Express, a business daily in India (but not as widely circulated or respected as The Economic Times or The Business Standard). Note the editorial below says your letter states ""that any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms automatically faces sanctions from that country."" Your letter did not state that, but this is a holdover from the earlier Financial Times interview.

Many people I have met with in the Indian government have made references to the letter, saying they do not think it was appropriate. I respond by saying that given our 9 year history of nothing but frustrations, and the lack of progress over the past 2 months, we do think it is appropriate and it reflects our current views regarding our experience in India. Generally, when they mention it time and again, it probably means the letter is having at least some of its intended effect. 

I'll keep you, Stan and Jim updated as we hear more from the Indian government.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, September 26, 2001


Lay off, Mr Lay (Editorial)
Enron tries terror tactics

Enron Corporation's CEO Kenneth Lay has reportedly written a letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee warning him of adverse consequences to the Indian economy if the Dabhol Power Company imbroglio is not resolved quickly. He says that if Enron receives anything less than its full investment in DPC, it would amount to an act of expropriation. He further points out that any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms automatically faces sanctions from that country. Reportedly, the letter was written three days after the attack on the World Trade Centre. So Mr Lay probably ought to be forgiven for reading more than he should into the ""dead or alive"" rhetoric of his pal, George W Bush, whose election campaign Mr Lay generously funded. Saner counsel has since prevailed even at the White House; and far from imposing fresh sanctions, the US government is busy buying support even from countries such as Pakistan by lifting sanctions and offering a hefty aid package. Enron has never hesitated to use the considerable economic and political clout of the US government in pushing the Dabhol project at various times. Post September 11, the US government - which is in fact 'rewarding' Pakistan despite its clearly identified role in funding terrorist groups - ought not to be terrorising India on Enron. Hence, it is entirely appropriate for the Prime Minister to borrow that little Americanism, recently made popular by Pervez Musharraf, and ask Kenneth Lay to lay off!

Interestingly, Mr Lay's letter apparently makes no mention of several important facts that will dictate how much India may have to pay Enron. These include the findings of the Madhav Godbole committee report which expose substantial overcharging by DPC on several counts and reveals excess capacity created for port handling and regassification. Moreover, DPC's inability to ramp up the power plant to full contracted capacity within the specified time period has enormous penal provisions attached to it. This serious technical deficiency apart - which alone is grounds enough for repudiating the DPC contract - the government also has a good case to charge the US company with fraud and misrepresentation. The Maharashtra government 's judicial inquiry only makes India's case stronger. Let us not allow ourselves to be pushed around by Enron's threats and political connections.

"FW: Community Partners' Stabilization/Transition Campaign","Cindy/Ken:

Just checking to see if Enron Community Relations/Lay Foundation has additional questions regarding Community Partners' request (described below) for immediate Stabilization/Transition Funding of $25,000 this year and a long-term commitment of $100,000 over several years.  I would be glad to visit with either of you regarding Community Partners and its future.   Thanks for your consideration.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Davis, Hardie  
Sent:	Friday, September 07, 2001 11:33 AM
To:	Milligan, Jennifer; Siegel, Misha
Cc:	Olson, Cindy; Lay, Kenneth
Subject:	Community Partners' Stabilization/Transition Campaign

Misha and Jennifer:  Thanks for visiting with me this week regarding Community Partners and our ongoing campaign.  Give me a call so I can schedule a tour for you two.
Cindy:  I regret that you were unable to join us but I did want to include you in this follow-up email requested by Misha and Jennifer, and to invite you to a tour of our clinic.

Background:   As you know, Enron (the old HNG) was a founding member of Community Partners (once known as Urban Affairs Corp.) and has been an on-going contributor to the non-profit for all of its 25+ year history.  Begun as an effort by the business community in Houston to increase the number of female minorities in the workforce by providing low-cost daycare to children of inner-city mothers, Community Partners has grown into a $2+ million annual budget organization whose emphasis now is school-based health clinics.  These clinics, including a mobile clinic operated in cooperation with Episcopal Health Charities and Christ Cathedral-downtown, are utilized by the UT-Health Sciences and UT Nursing Schools as teaching facilities for their students, interns and residents, and as a result,  we are able to offer a full-year of unlimited health care at a cost of approximately $100 per individual served -- a significant savings when compared to costs associated with government programs at charity hospitals.  Our associated childcare facility housed in an HISD school adjacent to our main clinic allows young school-age mothers to remain in school by providing care for infants and pre-schoolers while the students attend classes.

Prior Giving History:  For the first 15-20 years of its existence, Enron historically made an annual $25,000 contribution to the non-profit and in the last 10-years has annually purchased a $10,000 table at the Fathers of the Year Luncheon, which has become a one of Houston's most recognized luncheon fund-raisers.  Ken Lay has been honored and has served in numerous years as Honorary Chairman of the event, and he and his foundation normally buys a $25,000 table.   When EOG was an Enron subsidiary, Forrest Hoglund, chaired the event one year and the Hoglund Foundation has been a regular contributor.   Enron's Adopt-a-Child Holiday Program actually got its start in association with Community Partners when Enron employees would adopt and buy gifts for children in our childcare centers.  Over the last several years, Enron's contribution has been reduced to a $10,000 annual table purchase associated with the Fathers of the Year Luncheon.

Update on Community Partners:  After serving on the Board for 15+ years (two years as Chairman), the one thing I have learned about a non-profit like Community Partners is that there is never much surplus cash, especially at year-end, and we are always waiting for that next contribution.  Every year we have been able to squeeze by, but this year, because of a number of circumstances, Community Partners is in a severe battle for survival.  Because of personal health problems experienced by Executive Director Donna Bryant, her husband, Don, and son, Jason, the Board earlier this year decided to acquire the services of a fund-raising consulting group headed by Harriet Lattimer and Tom Herren to help us through this crisis and to make recommendations.  The Board overwhelmingly endorsed their recommendations which included the following:
Promoting Donna Bryant to a Chairman Emeritus position with continued salary over the next three years.  Donna would have no day-to-day duties, which will allow her to take care of her own health needs and to transition to retirement.  She would be called on only, as needed, on a consulting basis.   
Seeking $500,000 in immediate transition/stabilization support from certain foundations who have voiced interest in providing that support to keep this important program going.  (Grant requests of $250,000 each have been submitted to the Meadows Foundations and the Cullen Foundation.)
Beginning an immediate search for an Executive Director (with the enthusiastic assistance of Jackie Martin and her United Way staff) and to consider the hiring of a Development Director to focus on fundraising.   FYI:  I talked with Roy Hughes and have forwarded his resume to the Board search committee.
Refocusing of the Houston Endowment $150,000 annual grant to the clinics and requesting immediate payment.  (Accomplished) 
Strengthening of the Board of Directors.  (I have agreed to chair the Nominating Committee so any ideas you can contribute would be appreciated.)
Reapplying for United Way membership.  (We once were a UW agency but Donna did not like the limitations to fundraising  ... under the current circumstances, the Board now thinks otherwise.)
Beginning an immediate personal Board contribution campaign and to seek stabilization funding this year from the Houston community, both from corporations and individuals.   (Already underway.)
Consider a major endowment campaign next year to provide emergency cash flow in times when we are waiting for the foundation checks to come in.

Enron's Role??:  In addition to an immediate stabilization gift of $25,000 to $50,000 to help us through the remainder of the year, we would appreciate the consideration of a major gift in the $100,000+ range over a 3-5 year period for the Endowment Campaign.   We would also like a top Enron executive (Ken Lay would be nice, but it could be a nice intro to the Community for Mark Frevert or Greg Whalley) to consider chairing the Endowment Campaign once it gets organized next year.  I would also consider stepping down from the Board to allow a more high-level executive to represent us on the Board.

I apologize for the long-winded nature of this message, but I wanted to make sure that everyone knew all the facts.   Thanks for your consideration.

"Investing advice","Mr. Lay,
   I am a current holder of Enron common stock. I would like your opinion. I am 61 years old. My first stock purchase was of my Enron stock earlier this year. ($38.65)
I am not in the market for the short term. I am not spending money that will affect my standard of living. I am considering buying a couple of hundred shares of Enron stock. Do you think this purchase would be an investment that will grow in the long term or would it be a donation to Enron's creditors.

Thank You.

"Update - May 31, 2001","
BBT Fund (Bass Family):
We are currently filling out the paperwork for the BBT Fund which is set to  fund July 1 ($100k in Partnership, $250k personally).  I was  discussing with Andrew Linbeck, who works for Redstone Consulting and  introduced us to the Fund, the issue of using the fund as collateral.   He said that his clients have had some success with borrowing against the  Fund.  More importantly, one had borrowed from Bank of America (BA),  so a precedent has been set.  Andrew was not familiar with our BA contacts,  but said that he would be more than happy to familiarize them or any of our  other banking relationships with the BBT Fund.  If you recall, the Fund is  basically a bond alternative that has historically generated around 3 times  the risk free rate.  He has seen clients borrow against 40% to 50% of the  Funds value.
 
I am going to pursue this further by initially having Andrew meet with BA  and Compass.  I told Andrew that if he can help get our lenders comfortable  with it, then we would be more likely to build our position in the  Fund.
 
Aspen/Galveston Houses:
Still moving ahead.  I know you want to keep Aspen #1 out, at least  initially.  I am working with Jim Braniff, IV on the  insurance.  Jim and some of Gallagher Braniff's higher-ups have been  very involved, as well as interested in the outcome of all of this.  I  think that they might want a similar structure for themselves or other wealthy  clients that have similar circumstances.  Anyway, we are trying to address  all the issues on all fronts to ultimately protect you, your assets, and the  Partnership.
 
Braeswood & Kirby Apt. Development - Shawn  Gross:
The capital required is still being determined, but should be between $1.6  million and $2.2 million.  Per your request, you will have 10% and the  Family Partnership will have 8%.  I can lower  the Partnership's amount if you desire, but I thought somewhere  between 5% - 10% was good.  I am personally investing 2%.  Not sure if  the rest of the siblings are going to participate.
 
Family Partnership - Cash Flow &  Commitments:
As you know, the Family Partnership is in need of liquidity due to the  following: (i) monthly distributions; (ii) capital calls from outstanding  long-term commitments; (iii) additional costs associated with transferring the  homes into the partnership; (iv) funds to develop/maintain Aspen #4.   Currently, the only source of inflows is coming from the sale of options, which  is not generating enough (@ $53/share approx. $675k/mo.).  This month alone  the Partnership paid out approximately $700k in capital calls for long-term  commitments: $588k - SRE Properties, $97k - TCW/Hines Emerging Mkts R  E.  I know that you do not want the Partnership to borrow from  you, but today we had know choice so we borrowed $100,000 against your  BA line.  As we previously discussed, the only alternative would be to sell  a larger (one time) amount of options or exercise and hold.  Unfortunately,  all of the illiquid investments have yet to distribute anything meaningful of  recent.  
Family Partnership scheduled payments/outstanding  commitments:
1)    $210,000 - (due early June) Monthly Distributions to  the partners
2)    $200,000 - (due June 6) Vanguard Ventures cap  call
3)    $128,000 to $176,000 - (due mid June) Shawn Gross  development
4)    $400,000 to $450,000 - (June 30) Sterling Group
5)    $100,000 - (July 1) BBT Fund
6)    approx. $6.8 million exposure to outstanding  long-term commitments (after Vanguard & Sterling are funded)
7)    transfer of homes into the partnership would require  an additional est. $170,000 per month (approx. $2 million annually, including  Aspen#1); excludes the additional costs of Aspen #4 to be developed (est. $2.4  million) and maintained.
 
Upcoming meeting with Goldman Sachs:
Pete Coneway left me a message confirming our meeting at 3pm of June  13th.  Those scheduled to be present are Pete Coneway, Stacey Eastland,  Jeff Daly, two other Goldman guys flying in from NY, Barry Margolis, Jan Phipps  and me.  I wanted to reconfirm the meeting with you before I call Pete  back.
 
I hope Spain is/was enjoyable.  Will talk to you soon.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"","Dr. Lay-

I know that you are very busy right now, but I wanted to thank you for your efforts.  I just talked to a friend of mine.  I had said that I had not seen you anywhere over the last six weeks or so, he said that he had seen you at church.  As an employee, it comforts me to know this.

I know that you are working very hard on a myriad of projects right now.  I can only imagine the stress and strain that you are under, but I also wanted to warn you that I think the upper management is losing the faith of the employees.  This division could be cancerous to our new company as we attempt to rebuild Enron.  For that reason, I have been trying to come up with some concrete things that could mend this rift.  I am fearful that as a company our focus is very external, when many of the employees have faced amazing losses and personal uncertainty.  For that reason, I have put together a couple of pages of ideas that might be helpful.  This is not meant to be disrespectful, I simply want to put some of my ideas out there.  I am trying to help, and I feel frustrated.

I would appreciate it if you would read these two pages personally, not because you owe me something, but because you may be the only person who actually matters in this company right now.  

I have worked for Enron for a little over two years, and I still work for Enron.  I would like to continue working for Enron, but it is really hard to feel any level of confidence in these uncertain time.  Some of this is related to business uncertainty, but a huge percentage of this is because I feel like as a company we are slowly folding-up shop.  Employees are bitter.  Managers do not have clear direction.  Nobody is certain what is happening.   Basically, I just want to do my part to help.

Thank you for your time.

"HoustonChronicle.com","Isn't it funny that the same people who would have been screaming the loudest
about the ""immorality"" of Bill and Hilary Clinton had their daughter,
Chelsea, been cited for underage drinking  are the same people who now find
the treatment of the Bush family so ""outrageous?""  I can't stand Chuy''s

"","Mr. Lay,
  My name is Shelley Farias and I work for EES in the 3 Allen Center.  On Friday September 14 at 5:00 P.M. as I was leaving work I saw something that frightened me outside the 3 Allen Center.  In a car parked in the circle drive was a young man about 20 years old of Middle Eastern decent taking pictures of the Enron building and the 3 Allen Center.  Security was at the scene and asked the young man to stop taking the pictures, he got back in his car and continued to take the pictures.  My husband wrote down the license plate number and make of the car and gave this information to security.  Security informed us that they would take care of the situation. I spoke to security this morning and they do not have any report of this incident or the police being notified.   Mr. Lay with everything that has happened to this country I am scared that something may happen to us.  I would like to think I can come to work and be safe, but with security not taking instances such as Friday seriously I have doubts.  Please let me know what I should do contact the police myself or wait on security?

"Words of encouragement","Dear Mr. Lay
	Through all of the trials and negativity that is occurring I would like to send these words of encouragement from my family and I.  I have been with this company 21 years.  We have had many wonderful and exciting years with Enron.  When I first met my wife six years ago she was 90% in both ears.  Through the blessing of our insurance plan she now today has 98% hearing capacity in both ears.  The many years of working for Enron has provided me with a steady job and a good income, while allowing me to work on my Ph.D.  The many friendships and relationships I have been blessed with through working for this company will be treasured for the rest of my life.  Yes, I am one of the employees who have lost their retirement, but through all of this my wife and I would like to send our vote of confidence to you and the board to be able to find ways to make the impossible happen.  This company was built to be one of the worlds largest companies through your efforts over the past several years.  Yes, there has been experiments in going beyond normal paradigms and there has been mistakes made.  But through the mistakes is where the true gift of learning and stability comes.
	The ultimate challenge in life is not how much money one can make or that first ultimate achievement.  The ultimate challenge in life is ""CAN I DO IT AGAIN?"" We believe, that Enron can learn from what is happening and eventually become bigger, better, and stronger than it has ever been.  And we believe that you, Ken Lay, CAN DO IT AGAIN, bigger and better than it was done before.  
	I remember once reading about Donald Trump going into bankruptcy.  He summoned before him the best advisors in the world to pull the most educated and smartest financial people together to find a solution, and he moved on to build bigger and better investments.  ""HE DID IT AGAIN.""
	The true answers to the impossible come from the heart during our quiet moments with ourselves, in these moments I know you will find the answers.  My family and I have chosen to start the turn around of the negativity into a positive direction by believing that you and our board can make the impossible happen.  We have freely chosen to take the last $10,000 we have in our 401k and invest it into Enron Stock as a show of faith to ourselves that we believe the impossible can happen.  If anyone does not have the faith in themselves to make this happen please let our faith in you be yours for now.  Enron has always tried to go beyond the normal paradigms and can take advantage of this tremendous opportunity to create the impossible and do something that has never been done before. ""WE CAN DO IT AGAIN!""
	My family and I send all of you our love, faith and belief in yourself to do the impossible

I have asked both Ben Smith and Dan Leff to confirm
that these expenses will be paid so I can close the
office in Nevada.  It is a small amount but I can not
cover the cost for Enron out of my personal funds.
The total outstanding is $3,443.04.  Can you please
see that this gets paid ASAP.
Thanks and God Bless,
Chuck Allured

Ben, Leticia,
I hope this is not the last time we get to work
together.  As we discussed, I will have some office
closure expenses that I will need to get reimbursed
for.  I have been locked out of the server so I can
not enter them into the xms system.
This amounts to the following:

ATT wireless:
$212.71 November Billing
$90 Termination charge

Nevada Bell:
$170 November billing (est.)
$500 DSL Setup fee (November)
$49.95 November DSL monthly fee
$250 Termination Charge of one year contract

--------
$1,272.66 Total

Subject:	Lay It On the Line Survey Results

Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Dear Mr. Lay, 

My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards.  However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee. 

This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.   

If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions. 

I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue! 

The Trigger and Retaliation.    

Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge. 

I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following: 

-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work 
-        that I was making jobapplications by company email 

Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment. 

As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has: 

-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval. 

-        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results. 

-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further. 

Discrimination. 

It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.   





Hostile Working Environment. 

The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by ""threats"" rather than constructive comments.   

Wrongful Termination. 

Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time. 

I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case. 

Yours sincerely, 


Mingcheng Lian

"A Supportive Note","Dear Mr. Lay:

I'm writing this note to you as a show of support to you during your dire
times.  The reason that I share this with you is my respect for you as a
CEO, a business leader and a person.  My wife is one of your employees who
routinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring.  I
know that during difficult times, sometimes words emerge that can help
people through difficult times.  I believe that you are sincere man and
know that you must be broken hearted, but I hope that this article can help
you lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly.  My wife, Shelly
Pierce, has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of your
employees, has lost a great deal of her life savings.  Of course, I accept
most of the blame for this for reasons related to this article.  I lost my
investment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could not
falter.  After reading the article to her while I was out of town, I
believe that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the
challenges that lay before you.

Mr. Lay, I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our
family and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes.

From the USA Today, Tuesday, November 27, 2001, page 15A.

""In recession, face brutal facts, thrive""
By Jim Collins

    A man in his early 20s recently asked me, ""So what's a recession like?""
Its an entirely alien concept to him; he'd grown up during the greatest
economic boom in modern memory.  His question drove home the fact that we
haven't faced a severe, protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades,
leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times.
    With this recession - long in coming, perhaps long to stay - now
officially upon us, it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key
lesson about how great companies (and great people) deal with difficult
times differently from how they deal with merely good ones.  That lesson is
the ""Stockdale Paradox,"" a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge
from tough times not just intact, but stronger.
    Adm. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in the
Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War.  Tortured many times during his
8-year imprisonment, Stockdale lived without any prisoner's rights, no set
release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his
family.
    He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war
against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda.
At one point, he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor,
deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an
example of a ""well-treated prisoner.""  He exchanged secret intelligence
information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery
would mean more torture and perhaps death.  After his release, Stockdale
became the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both
aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor.
    You can understand, then, my anticipation at the prospect of spending
part of an afternoon with Stockdale, who happened to be at the Hoover
Institute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford.  In
preparation, I read In Love and War, the book he and his wife wrote to
chronicle their experiences those 8 years.
    As I read the book, I found myself getting depressed.  It just seemed
so bleak - the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors.  And
then it dawned on me:  Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office,
looking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.
I'm getting depressed reading this, and I know that he gets out, reunites
with his family and becomes a national hero.  If it feels depressing for
me, how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not
know the end of the story?
    ""I never lost faith in the end of the story,"" Stockdale said when I
asked him.  ""I never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I
would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of
my life that, in retrospect, I would not trade.""
    I didn't say anything for many minutes, and we continued the slow walk
toward the faculty club, Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his leg, still
stiff from repeated torture.  Finally, I asked, ""Who didn't make it out?""
    ""Oh, that's easy,"" he said.  ""The optimists.""
    ""The optimists?  I don't understand,"" I said, completely confused.
    ""The optimists.  Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be
out by Christmas.'  And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.  Then
they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.'  And Easter would come, and
Easter would go.  And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be Christmas
again.  And they died of a broken heart.""
    After another long pause, he turned to me and said, ""This is a very
important lesson.  You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in
the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline
to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they
might be.""
    My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me, but I
never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began
to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to
become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties
weakened and dispirited.  We found that companies that became great
embraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox.
    Fannie Mae, for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing $1M
every business day, with $56B in loans under water.  Many analysts thought
Fannie Mae, which was getting 9% on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15%
on the debt it issued, was doomed.
   But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not
merely survive, but also to prevail as a great company.  Yes, they
confronted the brutal fact that the interest-rate problem was not going to
magically disappear (certainly not by Christmas).  But they used this grim
fact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on
asking three central questions of greatness:
        What can we potentially do better than any other company in the
        world?
        What can best drive our economic engine?
        What best ignites the passions of our people?
    Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring,
Fannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions.
Eventually, it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the
general stock market.
    When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote
Fannie Mae off, Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company.
""Of course, we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things, but we never
entertained the possibility that we would fail.   We were going to use the
calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company.""
    The sad truth is that most executive teams won't respond that way to
these dark days of uncertainty.  Instead of using this recession as an
opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture
of discipline, the will simply restructure, lay off a bunch of people and
liquidate their cultural equity.  Mediocre leaders will hold out false
hopes for a quick fix, only to watch those hopes be swept away by events.
Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart.
    It need not be this way.  Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox -
those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail
in the end, but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal
facts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce
greatness.

    Used correctly, this recession can be a defining time in your firm's
history that , in retrospect, you would not trade.  Used wrongly, this
recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to
become great.  The choice is yours.

"California Market Design Breakthrough","
California Market Design Breakthrough
William W. Hogan
January 13, 2002

        A major step forward in California electricity market design appears in the proposal offered by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO paper is the focus of immediate discussion with its stakeholders in anticipation of a market design reform to be filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  This proposal has far-reaching and important implications.  The parallel discussions on standard market design at FERC must take this CAISO proposal as strong testimony adding support for the Northeast market model that has been shown to work.  The Midwest System Operator should be further encouraged in its market design since it already incorporates the insights now reported in California.  Texans should look with concern at the Texas wholesale market design that bears a strong resemblance to the original California model now explained as built on false premises.  The rest of the west should applaud and embrace the simple candor of the CAISO and get moving with a standard market design that respects the common physics of transmission systems.  European regulators and market participants should save years of agony and expense trying to build a viable electricity market built on the same false premises that California now exposes.
        California's market meltdown starting in June 2000 reverberated around the world.  The high prices and market collapse have been cited in many policy discussions as the reason to reverse course on electricity restructuring.  As bad as it was, the California market collapse was made much worse by factors unique to California in the retail market.  And this has distracted many from learning the lessons about wholesale market design that have much greater relevance beyond California's borders.
        California's was the most prominent market design built on the fallacy that the special characteristics of the electricity transmission grid were just details that could be ignored when designing the market.  Built on a faith that decentralized trading could solve all problems, the original California wholesale market design embraced a philosophy that emphasized trading and minimized the role of the essential system  operator.
        The key bad ideas have been discussed at length elsewhere (see www .whogan.com  ).  Central elements included simplifications supposedly intended to make the market better for traders.  In place of the reality of many locations with important impacts on transmission constraints, the design relied on a few large pricing zones.  In place of a realistic model of the transmission grid, the design used a so-called commercial network model that ignored critical features of the grid.  In place of point-to-point financial transmission rights, the design employed interface rights between zones.  In place of economic dispatch coordinated by the system operator, the design relied on decentralized trading that embraced artificially separated markets for ancillary services and ad hoc balancing rules for real-time adjustments.  In place of a coordinated energy spot market, the design imposed a separate power exchange and balanced scheduling requirements.     
        This flawed wholesale market design did not work.  From the very beginning, problems appeared and by the end of 1999 the FERC had rejected the many attempts to fix the superstructure without rebuilding the foundation.  Congestion Management Reform soon became Comprehensive Market Redesign.  Although the reform effort was overtaken by later events, the failure of the California wholesale market design should be a warning for every other market that has embraced its philosophy and adopted its details.
        Now the CAISO has taken up the serious task of fixing what is broken.  No longer constrained to be politically correct in defending the ideological errors that drove the earlier design process, the CAISO reports the simple truth.  ""Upon reexamination of the [Congestion Management Reform] proposal ? we find that some of the crucial assumptions underlying the [Locational Pricing Areas] concept break down.""(CAISO, p. 13)          The assumptions were crucial and flawed.  Trying to make the market simpler than is possible turned out not to be possible.
   ""?in reality, the 'simplicity' of the zonal system only appears so because the complexity is assumed away, allowing market participants to ignore it in scheduling while the CAISO must manage it through real time adjustments and periodic modifications to the rules to mitigate novel gaming strategies as they arrive.  ... it will be far simpler, and more transparent, to design forward [congestion management] procedures to be as consistent as possible with the real-time operating needs of the grid.""(CAISO, p. 14)          Amen. The CAISO paper elaborates on the implications and outlines a new direction that is a major break with its past.  The same design lesson was learned earlier in the Northeast markets including PJM, New York and New England.  Similar insights can be found in well-designed wholesale markets in other countries, from Chile to New Zealand.
        Given its prominence in promoting a fallacy, its failure in practice, and now its complete reversal on the basic principles, California's turnaround should be a pivotal moment that captures attention in the arcane world of electricity market design.
        The changes now proposed for California would be fundamental and sweeping.  Once reality is acknowledged, the range of possible market designs narrows substantially.  The pieces must fit together.  Prices have to reflect actual operations.  And the system operator must perform certain functions in a way that supports the public interest in an efficient and effective wholesale market.  The centerpiece would be a coordinated spot market organized as a bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices.  This can support bilateral transactions with transmission usage charged at the difference in nodal prices.  Point-to-point financial transmission rights would provide the economic equivalent of otherwise unworkable physical transmission rights.  This design works in theory and in practice. 
        The CAISO proposal is a beginning but still tentative embrace of this standard market design along with consistent day-ahead markets and unit commitment.  The CAISO needs to go further, and some of the ideas require close scrutiny.  For example, the suggested introduction of an available capacity market would be new to California and the concept is not fully developed in the proposal, but this is not much different than the rest of the country where design of capacity markets is problematic.  There is much yet to be done with the stakeholders and then at FERC.
        However, the CAISO deserves recognition and support for its candor and the intelligence of its proposal for the basic elements of the market design.  Enlightened market participants and leaders responsible for the public interest should resist any effort to compromise this essential reform or silence the truth.  The CAISO has taken a long step in the right direction.  
        Everyone interested in the success of electricity restructuring should hope that Californians complete the journey, soon.  We know what to do, and we can't afford to get it wrong again.

"Is Racial Profiling Necessary?","============================================================
Crossfire at 7:30 p.m. ET
On January 8, 2002
And online at CNN.com/CROSSFIRE
============================================================

From CNN's Crossfire Staff:

Tonight in the CROSSFIRE... the U.S. Justice Department
is putting top priority on tracking down 6,000
""deportable aliens"" of Middle Eastern and Arab descent.
Is it racial profiling to target one ethnic group for
ejection? Shouldn't all aliens who have overstayed their
visas or violated rules be treated equally? Could this
measure help prevent future terrorist attacks, or is it
a violation of individual rights? After Sept. 11th and
given the common characteristics of the hijackers, is
it justified to apply added scrutiny to those who fit
the same profile? Former Deputy Attorney General George
Terwilliger argues that profiling may be necessary in
the war on terrorism while Wade Henderson of the
Leadership Council on Civil Rights says individuals
of certain backgrounds shouldn't be singled out by
law enforcement. It should make for a heated debate.

"Financial Assistance"," FROM: ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN HEALTH AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT
           (OAHED)Under Auspice of UNIPH Foundation:
Reg  N0:85/2000
                           c/o  N0:9 Long Street
Banjul The Gambia; Telefax:220-390969


SUBJECT; RE:INTRODUCTION OF (OAHED)AND REQUEST FOR
FINANCIAL/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR EFFECTIVE TAKE-OFF
OF ESTABLISHING A LIAISON OFFICE  IN THE GAMBIA.

ATTN:KENNETH

INTRODUCTION
*Organization of African Health and Economic
Development (OAHED), was created with a vision to
coordinates efforts to combat diseases and promote
physical and mental health. Contribute significantly
to eradicate communicable diseases and promoting
improved sanitation and health condition in Africa and
promote economic development.
*OAHED based on a common vision on economic
stabilization strategies and shared conviction , that
(OAHED) have  a pressing duty  to eradicate poverty
and diseases and to place Africa countries both
individually and collectively on the path of
sustainable growth development at the same time
participate actively in the world economy.
*The programmme of (OAHED) is anchored on the
determination  of Africans to extricate themselves and
the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and
exclusion in the world globalization.
*Poverty and backwardness of African stand in stark
contrast to the prosperity of the developed world.The
continued imagination of Africa from the globalisaton
process and the social exclusion of the vast majority
of its people constitute a serious threat to global
stability.
*In Africa, 365 million peoples or half of the
population live on less than $1.00 per day.The
mortality rate of children under 5years of age is 140
per 1000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54
years. Only 41 percent of the population have access
to safe water, medical care, education etc. The high
rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 54 percent.
*OAHED calls for the reversal of this abnormal
situation by changing the relationship that underpins
it.African are appealing neither for the further
entrenchment of dependency through aid, nor for
margical concession.
*We are convinced that an historical opportunity
present itself to end the scourge of underdevelopment
that afflicts Africa. The resources, including
capital, technology and human skills that are required
to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment
exist in abundance.What is required to mobilize these
resource and use them properly, is bold and
imaginative leadership that is genuinely committed to
a sustained effort of human upliftment and poverty
eradication as well as a new global partnership based
on shared responsibility and mutual interest.
*In the circumstance, Organization of African Health
and Economic Development(OAHED) hereby declare that we
will no longer allow ourselves/African countries to be
conditioned by circumstances. We determine our own
destiny and call on the rest of the world to help and
complement our efforts. There are already signs of
progress and hopes. Democratic regimes that are
committed to the protection of human rights, peoples
centered development and market oriented economies are
on the increase. African people have begun to
demonstrate their refusal to accept poor economic and
political leadership.These development are,  however
uneven and inadequate and head to be further
expedited.
OAHED is about consolidating and accelerating these
gains. It is a call  for a new relationship of
partnership  between African and the international
community, especially the highly industrialised
countries, to overcome the development chasm that has
of course widened over centuries of unequal relations.
*Our perfect knowledge in respect of the high level of
your commitment and goodness in the vineyard of
humanity impressed and impelled us to seek for your
kind assistance to establish the (OAHED) liaison
office in the Gambia.
The materials and funds needed for the effective
take-off are as follow:
1.Cost of renting /furnishing
office??????????.USD$38,000.00
2.Logistics, ie, vehicles???????????????USD$325,000.00
3.Staff emolument, mobility and communication
etc????USD$57,000.00
4.Contingency  (5%)
    Grand Total ???????????????????USD$420,000.00
In the light of this, we are now on board in a
situation not to be described caused by financial
difficulty. We have no facilities neither have we any
money to purchase those materials that are absolutely
necessary in this issue.Your goodness to humanity has
ever been such as leaves not the smallest doubt you
will not suffer us to starve in the situation  you
have been pleased to place us, and which is such as
will ever tend to make us the most grateful/happy and
to ensure success as well as accomplish the set-up
goals.You  will be induced to take this issue into
consideration an urgent intervention in this
impediment, and by a little pecuniary aid, please
save us from this impasse.It will be an act worthy of
your self, and that imprint upon our heart which will
never be erased.
*OAHED will welcome any assistance you render to
enable us put in place the relevant infrastructures
that would enhance the effective and the presence of
Organization of African Health and Economic
Development in the Gambia. Any assistance given should
be considered a worthwhile service to God and Humanity
.If you require any further information or
clarification in any point, please do not hesitate to
ask.

Looking Forward to The Pleasure of your Compliance.

Yours Faithfully

Rev. Emmanuel .  E. Awuruh
CEO/PRESIDENT
ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN HEALTH AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT(OAHED)
THE GAMBIA, WEST AFRICA.

"FERC Meeting Summary","The Commission held its first open meeting with Pat Wood as the new Chairman today and discussed many interesting issues.  The following is a summary of the meeting.  The meeting is still going on, and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon (regarding market power).

RTOs 

Chairman Wood expressed his desire to finish the RTO transition, and that the Commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the RTO transition.  Chairman Wood considers the RTO effort on two tracks:  1) organizational -- what will the RTO organizations look like, and 2) substantive -- once you set up the organizations, what will they do.

Organizational Effort:  Wood stated that this effort has already begun with the July 12 orders and the Northeast and Southeast mediation efforts.  The Commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast, southeast and Midwest within the next couple of FERC meetings.  Wood also stated that it is time for RTO West and Desert Star to ""marry up,"" meaning, I suppose, that the two should consolidate.  Wood does not think that California can be included in the western RTO yet since it has lingering problems.

Structural Effort:  The Commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in Order No. 2000 into RTO structures.  To achieve this goal, the Commission is establishing an ""RTO week"" of advanced workshops, from October 15-19, in advance of issuing a NOPR, to address structural issues such as:  congestion management; cost recovery; market monitoring; transmission planning; reliability; transmission rights.  Wood also envisions that the Commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing Order No. 888 transmission tariff.  The new tariff will apply to all public utilities and RTOs.

Wood also recognized that some ""sticks"" are needed to entice RTO participation.  Therefore, Wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by December 15, 2001 with a declaration to join an RTO.  If they do not make this declaration, these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis.  Furthermore, Wood states that if entities do not join RTOs, they should not be authorized to merge their facilities, and that FERC will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by RTOs.  Wood states that these ""sticks"" provide incentive, but do not mandate, RTO participation.

With regard to the pending requests for rehearing, Wood asked legal staff to figure out how ""FERC can get there.""  In other words, I think Wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing.

While Commissioner Breathitt is skeptical about some of these RTO proposals, because she was not required to vote on anything today, she only expressed her concern.

Upcoming Dates

	October 15-19 --	RTO Workshops
	End of October -- further orders on Northeast, Southeast, Midwest RTOs
	December 15, 2001 -- all public utilities must commit to an RTO or have their market based rates revoked


Proposed Rule for Standards of Conduct

Within the next few days, FERC will be issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NOPR"") on standards of conduct for transmission providers.  As explained at the meeting (we do not have a copy of the NOPR yet), the NOPR will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly.  The NOPR also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates, not just marketers.  The standards of conduct would not apply to RTOs and transmission providers who are members of an RTO may ask for an exemption from the standards.

The NOPR will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission-owners' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers.  As you know, the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of TOs that are only buying and selling power for native load customers.  As the interim general counsel noted, these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the TO.  

There was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load.  Staff told the Commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules.  Pat Wood said they will include the proposal in the NOPR (Breathitt may not support), but if the industry does not support the proposal, FERC will pull it.  We of course will strongly support the proposal.

Provision of Adequate Electrical Capacity (ICAP)

Chairman Wood asked Staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements.  Wood noted that the Commission had to issue an order on ICAP in New England during their recess in August, and he is not that familiar with the issues.  Therefore, he asked Staff to prepare a presentation, which they made at the meeting this morning.  The presentation will be made public within the next couple of days.  In sum, Staff seems to believe that some type of ICAP requirement is needed for reliability.  

After the presentation, Wood noted that the New England ICAP order has enough wiggle room to allow the Commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue.  Wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized, competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply (without politically unacceptable, prolonged price spikes).  

Commissioner Brownell (from the Pennsylvania PUC) has a better understanding of  ICAP and expressed concerns that ICAP may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers.  

Realizing that there are many positions on this topic, Chairman Wood said he will publish the Staff report and ask for comments by October 17.  We will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process.

Sorry this is so long, but a lot happened today.  We will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over.  Let us know if you have any questions.

"Rebuild","Dear Ken:

I hear the company may be recieving bids for the trading arm of Enron.  I have heard that is the strongest part of the company.  I guess you know which is best to raise capital for the company, selling the trading business or holding on to it (a money making arm) to gain a stronger future position.  Good luck and may god be with your choices.

Dear Ken:

I am very sad to see what has happened to such a big icon in Houston.  I am very sorry to see you struggle through this and try to remain at a high level.  I am very pleased to see you chose to stay with the company and work at what I hope is its new birth and positive rise in society and business community.

I had a chance to meet with you a little over a year ago at a charity function.  While I am no expert in the energy business and I'm but a college student at the present time, I would like to share a view from the other side of the inner loop you???re used to.   Before I met you everyone I spoke with had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and what a genius you are.  After the news came out about the misfortune of Enron, some of those same people started bad mouthing some of the same people they praised.   It made me sick and made me think very little of those individuals.  I was concerned because I could not believe that you would intentionally and knowingly do something that would jeopardize the very company you helped build.  The day I saw you make the decision to not leave or step down as CEO I knew then that you must not have been directly involved in the cover-up done by your previous COO and a couple of other top executives you had entrusted.   Those few peo!
ple, one of which you had recently hired, all quit just before the news came out about Enron bookkeeping.

I feel safe in saying you must have been misadvised by those few people or you did not know what they were doing behind your back.  It is obvious they were not working for Enron like you, but rather ""at"" Enron to try to steal as much money and benefits they could and then head for the hills, which is what they did.   The mere act of having several top executives quit working at Enron after a short stay at the company and then cashing out on their holdings tells me it was intentional and I consider them thieves.  It would be a different story had they stayed like you and really cared about the company and what it represents and does for society as a whole.

I feel very sorry for those investors and employees who have been devastated by what has happened. BUT, it makes me very angry to hear people and writers casting stones on you and a company that has done so much over the past several years for so many.   Enron has funded more charity events and backed more functions and elections than most.  Now when the tide has turned and (due to a few greedy top executive decisions) Enron is in the position of needing help, everyone is out for blood and looking to end a company that still represent the same work it did before, but whose value has decreased because of word of mouth and the stupid greed of your previous employees.

Some people I have talked with say Enron is finished and is only a matter of time before it is gone.  That makes me angry too.  From what I see you have not given up on the company nor have you abandoned ship.  That tells me you may be trying to rebuild the company and its reputation.   That would be the greatest thing to do and show those who are out for Enron???s demise (and who can do nothing but bad mouth) just what you???re really made of and put them in their place.  I have been reading nothing but negative articles about the company.   I feel like it is not the company, because that would mean every single employee would be to blame.  Rather the writers should focus on the few individuals who cashed out and split.

I would hope you could remember back 4 or 5 years ago when the company was really thriving and doing well.  I hope you can remember the good things about the company and the fact that it can still (and does) make money from its businesses.  It can turn around if you want it to.   I would hope you can make the trading business and other companies held by Enron what it once was without having to sell off too many of the future profitable ones and make use of the two beautiful buildings now towering over Houston's skyline.  I call those Houston's twin towers.

Other large companies in the past have turned around after similar set backs as horrible as this with Enron.  Your turn around would be record setting.  I heard about others (like the teachers retirement fund) making noise about wanting to take Enron to court because they invested millions.   That is stupid because it is their choice to invest and their risk to take, especially making it after the news broke about the company.  Sure they trusted that Dynegy would merge, so perhaps their frustration should be aimed at Dynegy or perhaps use their collective educated minds together to help find a way to turn Enron around and make their investment purposeful rather than throwing stones.

I think Dynegy is a wonderful company as well, but it ""was mean"" for them to come out and say, ""yes they would merge"" and then not.  I realize it's all business and people like to make money, but it's another thing to flat steal and lie (like your executives you trusted did) rather than profit from hard work and honesty.

I personally know of many large corporations and politicians who have things to hide that would cause problems like yours.  Your company is not alone, which is why I am so angry with others throwing stones at you and Enron.  This would not happen if there weren???t executives in corporate industries like the ones you entrusted your company to who try to take rather than give and earn from it.   Perhaps many should learn from Colleen Barrett, COO of Southwest Airlines.  Do you know that they are the only airlines to refuse federal aid recently and they are doing better then most airlines.

Good luck and thank you for hanging in there and making me believe there are still some good top CEO's out there.

Dear Gil.

First of all, I wish to thank you for the recent e-mails you have sent me.
In the case of the one below, I would like to know weather are there some

services of NAFIN under the Guarantee Program of EXIMBANK. As you may be are
aware, we have concluded a Master Guarantee Agreement with EXIM through
which NAFIN is able to obtain a guarantee on the loans extended by it to
Mexican importers of US goods and services.

I will appreciate your feed back on this matter.

Thank you in advance.

"Some good ideas.","
Dear Kenneth,
 
    Sorry to have to bother you at  this time.. But maybe this is just what you need. And if things work out, please  consider a meeting with me to talk about a job.
    First get you and your crew in  front of that camera, preferably also surround yourself with alot of employees.  And let the world know that Enron is not going to roll over! I just talked to  you secretary, nice lady! BTW, she has my number.. And I see that your employees  still believe in your company.
    Second, do like Lee Iaiccoa did  with Chysler. Take your pay down to $1.00 for next year pending on how well  Enron recovers. Also ask you employees to take a pay cut by 50% for the next  couple of weeks effective today. Also make yourself and you top people available  to get the world markets to give you the room you need to be able to conduct  business. AND you know the rest.. I am sure you have some really sharp minds at  Enron.. PUMP the the emplyees up about doing whatever they can do to bring you  all back from disaster! AND MOST IMPORTANT!  KEEP EVERYTHING PUBLIC! No  matter what..  Also when you get time go around to everyone you can in the  company and apoligize, but most of all encourage them to keep up their good  work. You probably already know good leaders lead by example. Now is sure the  time of you life to make the difference and changes you and your people need to  do. When the dust clears, and I sure hope it does. Take time to get a more  personal relationship with all you people, even the lowliest ones. If you think  far enough back its' the quality of the little guy that makes the  difference.  On closing, I just got this feeling I know you can make the  difference. May God bless you. And don't be afraid to ask for his help.   Godspeed to you and yours.
 
 
SIncerely,
Jim Long
 
P.S. when things settle down, I REALLY know how to  make the broadband thing work! No joke.. I quit one of the first big DSL  companies cause of bs'ing customers.
P.S.S Feel free to call me anytime  313.336.5047

"RE: Change of Control Provisions","Dear Mr. Chairman:
Thanks for your excellent leadership, generosity and thoughtfulness. It reminds me of a story of an old man who is walking along the beach early in the morning. As the tide is going out and sun is coming up, it gets lighter and lighter and the old man spies a figure running along the beach, appearing to be dancing. When he finally gets close enough he sees that it's a young boy, picking up star fish that he finds lying in the sand...throwing them back into the ocean. ""What on earth are you doing?"", says the old man to the boy. The boy stops and says, ""The tide is going out and soon the sun will be high in the sky. These star fish will be stranded here in the hot sun and if they're not put back in the water, they'll die."" The old man looked at the boy and looked at the beach. ""You have an impossible task ahead of you. The beach stretches on and on for miles. There are hundreds of starfish. What possible difference can you make?"" The boy stooped down, picked up a star fish and flung it out into the water. Then he turned and looked at the old man and said, ""It made a difference to that one."" 
You've probably heard that story before...but... That's what it's all about...making a difference. At the heart of every successful organization, there are ""great people who do great things."" 
Thank you once again and we wish to have your continued leadership.
Best Regards
Jitendra

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"Hang In There","Mr. Lay,

I just want to voice a note of encouragement and appreciation to you during this unsettling period.  I don't know you personally, but under your leadership Enron has achieved great things, and regardless of the outcome of the current situation (which I fully expect to be positive) you should know that a lot of us appreciate your contributions and leadership.

As an employee for over 11 years, I've seen a lot at Enron, both good and bad.  But in my career I've been with a number of major companies, and none have been as exciting as Enron.

I'll keep it short--your time is valuable.  Hang in there, we're behind you.  And thanks for the leadership--it's a truly rare commodity.

"QUESTIONS REGARDING ADMIN PROMOTIONS","Mr. Oxley, as head of Human Resources for Enron North America, I would really appreciate your assistance.  I have met with various HR reps during my nearly eight-year tenure with Enron to understand the qualifications required for an administrative assistant to move into an exempt role.  From those meetings, however, I received severely conflicting information and left with a feeling that there are no rules, or that the rules are made and changed from person to person.  That being said, does HR follow a set of rules that are standard for all non-exempt promotions to exempt roles?  In addition, are qualifications to meet those standards changed with each individual?  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"RE: Wind asset","Rosie,

I have very patiently explained the situation to Wayne Rogers and Craven Crowell on behalf of the former Vice President.  I will call them again tomorrow, hopefully with a little more positive news and the possibility of being able to see some information some time next week.  I am sorry that Dr. Lay has been bothered by this.

Take care,

Ken--

At the conclusion of our phone conversation, you indicated that I should get
back with you if we were having any difficulty in pursuing our interest in
acquiring the Enron wind business.  Knowing the many demands on your time, I
regret to have to come back to you.  However, despite repeated attempts, we
are still locked out of negotiations over the wind asset and have been
unable to receive information we've requested.  Our phone calls have been
returned, but information and/or a seat at the table have not been
forthcoming.

Can we discuss this again by pbone?  Alternatively, as I suggested in a note
to you on Monday, we stand ready at any moment to come visit you in person
about this if you might have even 15 minutes for us.

Again, apologies for coming back to you about this.  But, it would be
extremely helpful if you could assist us in being able to move forward on
our interest in bidding on this business.

Many thanks!

"A Brighter Future","Ken:  I started buying Enron again this morning because I know
that all the sellers have vastly underestimated Ken Lay!  And I wanted
to say that more of them should be remembering what has been
accomplished at Enron.

Aside from ENE stock price, I trust all is well with you and your
familyand that you, like us, were all relatively unaffected by Sep
11.  We are fortunate to have work and other commitments to keep us busy

so that we don't have time to worry too much about anthrax, etc.  Our
base technology merger and acquisition business has remained steady this

year and we are now seeing increased activity again.  Our ""B2B"" semi
spare parts supply chain integration company, netMercury, has weathered
the downturn, with most of its competitors out of business now, and its
future looks bright.

I am starting a small venture capital fund to take advantage of great
investment opportunities in semiconductor and optical processing
technologies.

I am now commuting from Sonoma most days and I do think about terrorism
every time I cross the golden gate bridge--what a spectacular event an
attack on it would be!  I am reading the daily obituaries in the NYTimes

of the ""best and brightest"" that were lost in the World Trade Center so
that I can try to personalize and share, just a little, of what happened

and I have to admit that reading them gets me down some days.   I feel
now that we must achieve something very great and long-lasting in this
battle as a memorial to those who have been lost. And I believe that if
we project our power very strongly and determinedly, as is being done at

present, we can bring resolution, clarity and better balance to many
trouble spots around the world and that we can--and must--make the world

better for the next generation of Arab peoples and Islamic believers
everywhere.  I am so proud of our system and the way that both parties,
for the most part, are cooperating in these challenging times.

I believe that we must take steps to educate our next generation about
Islam and find a way indirectly to educate the next generation in the
Middle East especially about how Islam  (at least the moderate
interpretations of the Koran) can thrive in our inclusive Western
culture.  I am re-reading Seven Pillars of Wisdom (T.E. Lawrence) and
find the first chapter on the history of the Semitic people, the Arab
tribes and Islam to be especially topical just now.  Even bought a
two-volume set of the Koran and a book on Islamic Art, to try to
understand better the situation we will be in for a few years now, if
not the next generation.

Although we still have the SF house, our main address now is 19400 Wyatt

Road, Sonoma 95476, where we have our guest house completed and extra

"Re: Ken's SEC Testimony","Dear Fam.
The Feb 4 testimony is on the Hill, in the morning in
front of the Senate and afternoon in front of the
House. They will likely be played on CSPAN 3 which you
can either watch on the internet or I believe it is
somewhere on Warner cable.

"Information","Kenneth,

I'm an associate in EES, and I have been working in Enron for two an a half years.

First I would like apologies if this causes any inconveniences, but I am writing this email to you because I'm quite concern about the latest news about the partnership/CFO  that came out in the last week or so. Me and many of my fellow A/A co-workers as well as other employees do not know what is going on, and speaking for myself, if it's possible for you to let me and everyone else know what the situation is and how are you taking measures to reassure confidence in the marketplace I would greatly appreciate your time.

I assure you that many of my fellow A/A co-workers have confidence in the future of Enron, and I expect that greener pastures will be in front of us very soon.

Many thanks in advance,
Carlos Vicens

"Airport Security Overkill? & Clinton Team Running","============================================================
Crossfire at 7:30 p.m. ET
On January 9, 2002
And online at CNN.com/CROSSFIRE
============================================================

From CNN's Crossfire Staff:

Tonight in the CROSSFIRE... After a U.S. congressman is
asked to drop his trousers and a young Muslim woman has
to remove her head scarf, some are asking if airport
security has gone too far. Is security screening going
overboard, or are these measures necessary to prevent
future terrorist attacks? Should more sensitivity be
applied to religious practices, or should everyone expect
to be subjected to extensive searches? What is the best
way to keep the skies safe and not violate passengers'
rights? We are joined by Enaas Sarsour, the young lady
asked to remove her head scarf at the Baltimore airport
last month, and then, two security experts debate whether
the added barriers are equating to increased safety
in the air.

Then, Robert Reich announced his candidacy for
Massachusetts governor today and joins many of his former
Clinton administration cabinet members in running for
public office. Will they be running on the record of their
former boss or running away from it? Can Former Attorney
General Janet Reno and Former Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson escape the controversies that dogged them in
office and become governors of their home states? Former
Clinton White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart and top
Republican Strategist Charlie Black join us to discuss
the candidates prospects.

Join Bill Press and Tucker Carlson tonight on Crossfire,
7:30pm eastern, 4:30 pacific. On CNN. You won't want to
miss what the hosts have to say about Vice President
Cheney's continued hibernation.

"Chugai","
You may recall that Lilly entered into a joint venture with Chugai in 1999 to gain assistance with developing a number of Lilly compounds in Japan and as an opportunity to work closely with Chugai as a prelude to acquiring a significant interest in the company.  As we discussed in June, it became clear that Lilly would not acquire such interest in Chugai and we no longer need Chugai's help with clinical development.  Therefore, we decided to terminate the joint venture.  Attached to this message is a copy of the press release Chugai will issue tomorrow morning regarding the dissolution of the joint venture and a related amendment to the 1995 agreement under which Chugai will co-market raloxifene.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions in this regard.

"Enron Principal Investments - Organizational Memo","
Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge, so I had to get a guest pass, this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time.  However, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn't been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here at Enron.  Can you see where I am going with this?  

Anyway, I'm a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold.  I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it.  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody.

Sincerely,

Aaron Berutti

We'll go forward from this moment
by Leonard Pitts Jr.
The Miami Herald

It's my job to have something to say. They pay me to provide words that help
make sense of that which troubles the American soul. But in this moment of
airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can
find to say, the only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the
unknown author of this suffering.

""You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.""

""What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our World
Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn?
Whatever it was, please know that you failed.""

""Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause.  Did you
want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve.  Did you want to tear us
apart? You just brought us together.""

""Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a
family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family
nonetheless. We're frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional
energy on pop cultural minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's
misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready
availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we
walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are
fundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle
to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority
of us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God.""

""Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak.
You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot
be measured by arsenals.""

""Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still
grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to
make ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some
Hollywood blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel.
Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final
death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of
terrorism in the history of the United States and, probably, the history of
the world. You've bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before.""

""But there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us
fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time
anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and
monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in
our force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any
suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice.""

""I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I
think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with
dread of the future.""

""In the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers
pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be
done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security,
misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment
sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.""

""You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our
character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this
day, the family's bickering is put on hold.""

""As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we
will rise in defense of all that we cherish.""

""So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that
maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that's the
case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange:  You
don't know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know
what you just started.""

""But you're about to learn.""

""Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy...""
Vol. 3, Issue 43
October 29, 2001

1. Anthrax Panic Hijacks Pharmaceutical Industry
2. If Environmentalists Owned the Alaskan Oil Fields...
3. Growing Recognition of a Growing Government

-------------------------------------------------------------

ANTHRAX PANIC HIJACKS PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

The Bush administration's recent ""success"" in securing low prices
from Bayer AG, the German drug manufacturer, for Cipro, its
anti-anthrax antibiotic, will ultimately reduce rather than protect
the health of Americans, according to a new op-ed by economists
Michael Reksulak and William F. Shughart, a research fellow at The
Independent Institute.

Bayer agreed to slash its prices to the U.S. only because of strong
intimidation by the federal government. Some in Congress have called
for the U.S. government to override Bayer's patent protection for
Cipro, which expires in 2003, unless Bayer reduces the price of Cipro.

Patent protection is especially important in the pharmaceutical
industry, because it helps ensure that a company can recover its
massive outlays for research and development, as well as make up for
the delays and uncertainties associated with the FDA approval process.

But ""letting the 'anthrax scare'... break this link between up-front
investments and future profits reduces the expected returns to R&D
and greatly increases the uncertainty of the whole drug development
system,"" Reksulak and Shughart write.

""An increase in the number of companies permitted to produce Cipro
now -- or forced reductions in the antibiotics' price -- means that
fewer new drugs will be produced in the next 10 to 20 years than
would have otherwise been the case. Already willing to sell drugs to
governments at steep discounts, drug makers now have to worry that
they may be bullied into accepting even lower returns or face the
loss of patent protection altogether.""

By threatening private property rights and undermining the rule of
law, the U.S. government's shakedown of Bayer, Reksulak and Shughart
conclude, ""are far more damaging than any single terrorist attack has
ever been.""

IF ENVIRONMENTALISTS OWNED THE ALASKAN OIL FIELDS...

Legislation that would permit oil exploration in Alaska's Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) may soon reach the president's desk.
(U.S. Senate Majority Leader, Tom Daschle, says he will allow the
bill to go to a floor vote when there are 60 senators who support it.)

In response, many environmental groups, most notably the Audubon
Society, have renewed their strong opposition to drilling in the
ANWR. Ironically, however, if environmentalists owned ANWR, they
would probably allow drilling, using the proceeds to help promote
their conservation elsewhere, according to Dwight R. Lee, writing in
the fall 2001 issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

""Consider what an environmental group would do if it owned ANWR and
therefore bore the costs as well as enjoyed the benefits of
preventing drilling,"" writes Lee.

In fact, the Audubon Society does allow oil drilling on an oil field
it owns, the 26,000-acre Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana.

""The willingness of environmental groups such as the Audubon Society
to allow drilling for oil on environmentally sensitive land they own
suggests strongly that their adamant verbal opposition to drilling in
ANWR is a poor reflection of what they would do if they owned even a
small fraction of the ANWR territory containing oil.""

If environmentalists owned ANWR, ""they might easily conclude that
although ANWR is an 'environmental treasure,' other environmental
treasures in other parts of the country (or the world) are more
valuable. Moreover, with just a portion of the petroleum value of the
ANWR, efforts might be made to reduce the risk to other natural
habitats, more than compensating for the risks to the Arctic
wilderness associated with recovering that value.""

This is not, Lee emphasizes, a recommendation to give ANWR to
environmental groups. Rather, it is a call to recognize that economic
incentives matter -- even to environmental groups. An environmental
group that refuses to put its money where its mouth is, is free to
clamor for locking up resources -- it bears no direct cost for
prohibition. One that owns resources, however, faces the reality that
wise resource ownership entails the balancing of priorities.
Unfortunately, it is the former type of environmental group has
tended to prevail.

See ""To Drill or not to Drill? Let the Environmentalists Decide,"" by
Dwight R. Lee (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2001), at
http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink3-43-3.html.

FREEMAN, April 1999), at

-------------------------------------------------------------

GROWING RECOGNITION OF A GROWING GOVERNMENT

The irony that an administration that had trumpeted small government
and reliance on market forces now backs numerous significant
government interventions -- including huge subsidies to businesses,
IMF and World Bank funding to new allies, and far-reaching
""anti-terrorism"" legislation that has civil libertarians up in arms
-- has not been lost on the national press.

In a recent article in the NEW YORK TIMES, reporter Richard W.
Stevenson reports that after years of wrangling between Republicans
and Democrats over the size and scope of the federal government, ""the
two parties are more or less united now in the view that a strong
federal government with expansive powers is vital for the time being.""

""Scholars say the expansion in the size and powers of the federal
government in response to the terrorist attacks is similar to what
has happened in past wars and crises,"" the article continues.

""'We are rushing very quickly to throw overboard announced positions
about government assistance to private enterprise, about
surveillance, about security measures of various kinds that intrude
on our liberties,' said Robert Higgs, the author of CRISIS AND
LEVIATHAN: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government.
'In that respect, this episode mirrors the great national emergencies
of our past,' Mr. Higgs said.""

If, as President Bush implored the country, we must not let the
September 11 terrorist attacks change our way of life, we must resist
the impulses that have enlarged the federal government -- thus
reducing American's political and economic liberties -- every time
the nation has seen a national crisis.

Fortunately, as pop psychologists tell us, recognizing a problem is
half the challenge in correcting it. Unfortunately, special interest
groups will work to keep Americans in denial.

Stevenson (NEW YORK TIMES, 10/28/01), at

From: 	Shields, Jeff  
Sent:	Wednesday, November 07, 2001 8:30 AM
To:	'Ken Lay- Chairman of the Board & CEO@ENRON'
Subject:	RE: Daily Update

On Behalf of Jeff Shields

So when is Ken Lay going to tell us something with substance in these reports. This morning I listened as four different co-workers came in and logged on and snickered or made other negative remarks in response to today's email on behalf of Ken Lay. One person said she wished we would stop getting these emails because they are ""empty."" All we are getting are generalities and hollow comments about yesterdays news. Lets hear some positive statements from Ken Lay making clear that the financial actions of Enron are clean. I would appreciate being told exactly what it is that the SEC is looking  for. Many in the Portland office are asking just who are these Board members and what is it that drives our Senior Management? We know their names, we don't understand their values. I want to see leadership. Where is Ken and the Board? Mayor Guiliani got out in the public after the World Trade Center disaster and reassured the public. He became a leader. He didn't sit in his office and have a ghost writer send empty emails to city employees. 

I watched as Rite Aid went through something similar to what Enron is going through. Enron would be well served to study the Rite Aid situation and learn from their experience. Rite Aid stumbled along for 6 months while the Board and CEO defended their actions and were not able to face reality until the company stock fell from $50 to $3. You need to make dramatic changes in the management structure or else management needs to step out and publicly restore confidence. It does NO GOOD for the Board and Ken to stand behind management and business groups only to turn around and put individuals ""on leave"" or close those business groups you stood behind a day earlier. 

I noticed how little confidence the top executives at Enron had in this company when they sold off hundreds of millions of dollars in stock between November and February. Many of us see that as the beginning of the moral bankruptcy at the top of Enron. We put our retirement in your hands and you pilfered it. I had so much faith in Enron's management that I have taken my annual bonus in stock options. To me that is a duty to demonstrate my commitment to Enron. Rumors are circulating in the Portland office that the Board is not likely to fund a bonus pool this year. Now that is inspiration! Is that true? 

You MUST instill confidence in your employees TODAY. You claim that Enron employees are your most valuable assets. You had better treat them as such. Email such as this one DO NOT INSPIRE confidence. This is not Enron's proudest moment. I enjoy working for the company. I take pride in my work and do my job honestly and open. The deals I bring in to this company are done in the spirit of mutual benefits with our counter parties. I was disappointed to get a copy of a PR piece in my home mail yesterday with interviews and profiles of ""Three Men.""  Reading their values and accomplishments led me to believe these guys are motivated not by family and ethics but rather by material possession. This is the intellect of failure. If your driven simply to own a boat and your measure of success was recognized when you bought a big house, there is a very high probability that you will breech the line of ethical (and perhaps legal) financial actions in order to have more. 

Please send us a statement from Ken Lay and the Board telling us about the Cultural Values they are going to strive to instill in the company. I think a huge statement would be made by having the Board of Directors and Ken Lay personally reinvest the hundreds of millions of dollars that you have taken out of this company back in Enron stock TODAY. 

Ken Lay should come to Portland and give us reassurance that the earnings from this business unit mean something. Ken needs to be a leader. Please, no more ghost emails.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

With every article I read concerning Enron, I think  of you and the obstacles you surmounted in the mid-80s. If you need  help in the Public Affairs arena, my timing is perfect. Peyton and I,  within the last month, moved into our new home in Santa Fe. I am between  commitments to allow time to get settled in the new place. I will be happy to  come to Houston if I can assist you in any way. Hang tough!
 
Every good Wish,

"wealth management, taxes from diversifying personal portfolio, in	troducing myCFO","
Hi again, Ken.
  
First, I hope you, your family, loved ones  and friends were not hurt in the tragic attacks this month.  And thank you  for sharing with me your views on California's energy crisis, and also the  challenge of global warming.  I hope we can work together on these  issues.
  
I'm writing to introduce you to myCFO, a  venture where many of my partners use (and love) the services.  John  Chambers, Jim Barksdale and I serve on the board.  myCFO is a  unique wealth advisory firm for high net worth individuals.  Particularly  at this time -- in turbulent markets, and before the close of the tax year -- we  think myCFO might be of value to you and your family.
  
While you may have a team working full-time managing  your assets, we've found myCFO can add important value to an existing advisors  or a family office.  
myCFO provides advanced tax planning,  investment advisory, estate planning and philanthropic services to several dozen  clients who have significant dedicated teams in place.  These  clients choose to work with myCFO because of the unique expertise of  myCFO's professionals -- leaders in their fields, each averaging over 15 years  of experience in serving affluent individuals.  myCFO is able  to leverage their constant exposure to the relatively few  U.S.families  facing wealth management issues at their level  -- particularly at critical  decision points. 
Most of myCFO'sclients are insiders in public companies  who have, and are concerned with  effectively diversifying concentrated positions.  myCFO regularly developsand implementssophisticated asset diversification  and effective tax minimization  strategies for their clients.  They are  really personal financial innovators.
Our  experience is that a 60 minute meeting with myCFO -- a ""get to know you"" and ""high level  diagnostic"" is well  worth the time. 
May I ask Art Shaw, myCFO's CEO, to give you a call?
best to  you, your team, and your loved ones,
John  Doerr

"CEW Memo to ACCF Board","Dear Ken: 
Second, I want to give you a""heads-up"" on a memo to the ACCF board of directors wich will arrive shortly by mail.  Both ACCF and some members of its board have been mentioned in the press around the country in connection with Enron, David Duncan (one of our directors), and you.  In addition, last week the Wall Street Journal name me as a board member in 1999, although as you know I retired in May of that year.   
I wanted our directors to know how Mark Bloomfield and I have tried to handle a substantial number of calls from the press.  I have talked with no reporters and Mark has, I think, handled the few he has talked with very well.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

I don't know if you are the right person for this - but I thought that someone should register Enron in the new domain(s) asap before we lose them.

Although I am in IT, I am not really in the right area and neither is my direct chain of command (although I think they are just great to work for)

"RE: Precious man of God.","
Oh Mr. Lay, I am woefully sorry. I know you will be talking to the employees soon and I will be praying for you. 
I was just praying and asking God what I could say to you. I don't want to be presumptuous. This is the verse that came to mind. Psalm 34:19 ""Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.""  
You may not feel righteous right now but you are. When you gave Jesus your life, you became righteous. So you will be delivered-it may not look like it now but this is not the end of the story. He has a plan. I know that you can't see HOW this could work together for good for you but it will. Great is His faithfulness! All afflictions-it says. ALL!

   Subject:  Precious man of God. 
   Mr. Lay, 
   I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in 
the 
   past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. 
Dear 
   sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to 
   encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon 
the 
   name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord 
and 
   remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! 
His 
   arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
   You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is 
of a 
   good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song 
   right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you 
such 
   comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about ""all of my help 
   cometh from the Lord"". How true that is for you. 
     Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a 
man 
     of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an 
ever 
     present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head 
but 
     under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. 
     Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, 
Lord. 
     Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. 
Hear 
     him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you 
are 
     mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good 
thoughts 
     and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may 
have 
     an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think 
     toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to 
     give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? 
     Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the 
     mighty name of Jesus! 
   Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and 
   carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will 
   need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth 
was 
   fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)! 
   Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and 
   every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt 
   condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their 
   righteousness is of me, saith the LORD. 
   Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as 
to 
   what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from 
   the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in 
Isaiah 
   6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT 
   mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of 
   God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an 
   Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. 
The 
   ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to 
God 
   because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He 
   hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, 
   Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's 
SPIRIT 
   and not our strength. 
   When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my 
   beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has 
knit 
   my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells 
us 
   to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? 
EVERYTHING! 
   God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't 
our 
   ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can 
ask 
   or think!

TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL-HOUSTON REACHES MILESTONE
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE GRANT TO SUPPORT TFA/AAMA PROJECT
ALLISON AND TERRORIST ATTACKS IMPACT FUNDING

----------------------------------------------
TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL-HOUSTON REACHES MILESTONE
100 Community Based Organizations Served since 1998
An estimated 20,000 persons now served each week

Houston, Texas  - (October 5, 2001) - Since the first installation of a
computer lab at the M.D. Anderson YMCA in May 1998, Technology For
All-Houston (TFA-Houston) has helped develop and create 100 community
technology centers (CTCs) serving Houston's underserved communities.  The
100th CTC installation is in collaboration with The Living Temple Ministries
Inc. (TLT, Inc.), a community-based organization developing a new CTC that
will serve Houston's northeast side.  TLT, Inc. will utilize the lab to
expand a workforce development initiative called the Alpha Career Center.

TLT, Inc. is a non-profit, multi-racial, faith-based organization
incorporated in Houston in 1997.  Since inception TLT, Inc. has developed
programs designed to serve low to middle income Houstonians.  Initially
operating in Southwest Houston, the development of the new CTC will enable
TLT, Inc. to expand services to the Northeast side.  In addition to
providing technology access and after school activities, the CTC will serve
as an extension of TLT, Inc.'s successful Alpha Career Center workforce
development and training program.  The Alpha Career Center offers free IT
classes to underserved individuals, and through a relationship with CC
Staffing, is able to provide job placements upon student completion of the
program.

TFA-Houston is pleased to support TLT, Inc. and the Alpha Career Center
because of the innovative programming and volunteer support, as well as
their proven track record of accomplishments in the community.   The
provision of computer hardware and access to TFA's suite of online software
will allow TLT, Inc. the opportunity to further its mission of  ""ministering
to the total man.""  Technology For All-Houston is proud to be a partner in
this effort.

Since its organization in late 1997 TFA-Houston has focused its efforts in
Houston on the development of collaborative relationships with
community-based organizations serving Houston's low-income underserved
population. With each organization TFA-Houston has helped develop a
technology and program plan that will serve the needs of the community.
Using new computers and computers redeployed from corporate donations,
TFA-Houston has worked with the organization to build a community technology
center.  Additionally, TFA-Houston brings other supportive and collaborative
relationships to each new CTC it helps develop.  These include the expertise
and online content resources provided by its parent organization Technology
For All (TFA) and others.

TFA-Houston is the local affiliate of TFA.  Together they have also
developed key supportive relationships with the Houston Technology Center,
The Telecom Opportunity Institute, Rice University, the Houston Children's
Museum and the Houston Area Technology Advisory Council of the Greater
Houston Partnership.   Each of these collaborative relationships help
provided added value to the support that TFA and TFA-Houston bring to local
grass roots organizations bringing technology to Houston's underserved
communities.

Community-based organizations assisted through the collaborative efforts of
TFA and TFA-Houston include local YMCAs, community centers, churches, faith
based social service agencies, community development organizations and
others focused on providing services to Houston's low-income underserved
communities. In addition to the M. D. Anderson YMCA, organizations assisted
include the Liberation Project, a CDC in Missouri City, the Pleasant Grove
Baptist Church, the Tejano Center, the Park Place United Methodist Church,
Talente Bilingua, and the Southeast Family Community Center. While

$850,000 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE GRANT
Supports Project of Two Houston Non-Profits

Houston, Texas  - (October 1, 2001) -Technology For All (TFA) announces a
relationship with the Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans
(AAMA) toward the accomplishment TFA's national initiative to bring
technology to underserved communities.  Through an $850,000 grant from the
Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) of the U. S. Department of Commerce,
the Latino Technology Network (LTN) will connect twelve diverse
Community-Based Organizations across the nation.  Community Technology
Centers (CTC) will be established within eleven of the organizations for
educational and technology training.   Community Technology Centers are a
places in many underserved communities where students can utilize computers
and take advantage of online content provided by TFA.   AAMA will help
develop the LTN, and TFA will provide CTC participants with access to the
complete suite of SmartForce e-Learning courses, which includes everything
from basic technology skills to several certification tracks.  SmartForce
courses are offered in English and Spanish.  CTCs will work with at-risk,
inner-city Hispanic high school students to train them in advanced web-based
applications and maintenance of the national network.  Students taking
SmartForce courses will gain skills necessary for competing successfully for
higher-wage technology employment upon their graduation from high school.

The United States Hispanic population is increasing dramatically-from 35.5
million or 12.5% of the total population recorded in the 2000 census to a
projected 98 million in 2050.  The LTN project will provide CTCs with a
network for collaboration and sharing as well as affordable access top
high-speed internet connectivity and technical support that the CTCs
otherwise would not be able to support.  The project makes a concerted
effort to reach out to at-risk youth.

TFA provides affiliated CTCs with access to the TFA ""eSource Room""*, a
private, password protected web space that provides access to application
software and educational content.  Through the ""eSource Room""*, students
will be able to access online content focused on their individual learning
needs.

""This new relationship with AAMA will encourage collaborative relationships
between several Latino organizations and community technology centers in
underserved communities"", said Technology For All President and CEO Will
Reed. ""We are pleased that students and families with limited means will now
have some of the same educational opportunities that others take for
granted.""

AAMA is considered one of the most successful Hispanic non-profits in the
United States, celebrating thirty years of service to Texans.  At its
Sanchez Charter High School AAMA has pioneered the Advanced Technology
Computing Center, a working model for training ""at-risk"" youth and placing
them in jobs with Fortune 1000 corporations.

TFA and AAMA provide the Latino Technology Network with needed expertise,
skills and infrastructure.  Other project partners include the National
Puerto Rican Coalition, the National Association for Bilingual Education,
the National Puerto Rican Forum, the Cuban American National Council,
Student Alternatives Program, Inc., the Center for Training and Careers,
Chicanos por la Causa, Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee, Multicultural
Area Health Education Center, and the National Association of Latino Elected
and Appointed Officials.

ALLISON AND TERRORIST ATTACKS IMPACT FUNDING

Technology For All and Technology For All-Houston have both been impacted by
the important support that foundations and corporations have given to flood
relief and terrorist victim support.

To do its part, both organizations have reduced monthly operating expenses
through staff attrition, voluntary salary reductions by senior staff and
other means.  Both organizations are also working to increase both cash and
in-kind donations in an effort to weather the storm of funding reductions
brought on by the difficult events of recent months.

"Annual Meeting 2002 Programme - KnowledgeConcierge Service - CORRECTED ACCESS - ref:nro","To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Enron


***********************************************************************
IMPORTANT MODIFICATION:
Yesterday we sent you the following message with incorrect username and
password. Please accept our apologies and note the correct information
modified below that will allow you access to the Members' Area of our
website.

***********************************************************************

Dear Dr Lay,

Now that you have received the Annual Meeting 2002 Programme Preview, we
would like to assist you further in preparing for various workshops and
interactive sessions.

The World Economic Forum and PricewaterhouseCoopers have developed an
innovative service on our website, the KnowledgeConcierge. The
KnowledgeConcierge allows you to learn more about a workshop or interactive
session in the Annual Meeting 2002 by providing a ""state of the debate""
essay which frames the particular topic addressed.

As a further enrichment, it provides pre-selected links to key online
resources on the topic area. Finally, it offers a Personal Query service:
all participants in workshops and interactive sessions have the opportunity
to enquire further about specific issues related to programme topics. The
responses developed by a KnowledgeConcierge research team will be returned
to enquirers within a maximum of 24 hours.

The KnowledgeConcierge is now available by first clicking on the Annual
Meeting 2002 link in the Members' Area of the World Economic Forum's
website (http://www.weforum.org/private). Once in the Annual Meeting 2002
area, click on the programme link. From a workshop/session page, you can
access the KnowledgeConcierge by clicking on the ""read more"" link on the
right-hand side of the screen.

As a reminder, your personal username and password to access the Members'
Area are as follows:

Again, we encourage you to explore online the Annual Meeting 2002 programme
to prepare for your participation in New York.


Yours sincerely,

Lee Howell
Director, Annual Meeting Programme

"Theatre Under the Stars.....2002 Gala...My request for you to be Co-Chairs with your friends...the Bush's","



Dear Ken,

Since you and I go to the same church  and are on the Trustee Board together
( First United Methodist Church )   as well as serve together on the Greater
Houston Partnership board ,etc, etc..I think I can imagine how busy you are.
And I know how hard it is to contact you too.I am going to ask this very
informally...but  very sincerely... I have a LARGE favor of you...and I did
not want to ask YOU in public last Tuesday at GHP Ex. Committee  nor  at
lunch with Elizabeth Dole.

I am the new Chairman of  the Theatre Under the Stars  (TUTS) Board. I
preface my request with  that announcement  so you will know how important
this is to me as well as to  TUTS and  the city at large.

IT IS WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASM AS WELL  AS GREAT HONOR...that
I tell you that  President and Barbara Bush  have  said YES to being the
Honorary Chairs of the May 18th,2002  Theatre Under the Stars (TUTS) Gala
...our opening night in the new Hobby Center for the Performing Arts .I know
you (very graceously) turned down my request to be a Theater Under the Stars
(TUTS)  Board member...but my favor NOW  is asking you and your lovely wife
to serve as Co- Chairs for that event along with George and Barbara. I have
a few other prominant Houstonians that I will be asking to Co-Chair  along
with you.And if you have anyone you think would be appropriate to serve with
you ...please let me know.


We have some grand ideas and need only your name and influence to make this
a successful evening for TUTS!You and your wife may be as involved or not
involved as you like!We would like to top the funds raised by this current
year's event that was Co -Chaired by Chuck  and Kim Watson .They helped TUTS
to raise over $350,000. We want to raise the bar for this event as it is a
World Premier Opening for an Internationally Reknown Organization....Theatre
Under The Stars.The new theatre holds 2600 people.We want every seat filled
for this event!


The Hobby Center -Music Hall Foundation Board will be having their own
opening Gala...I am sure you have already heard about it...It will be in
April or early May before ours as they are the landlord...we are the #1
tenant...they get to have their opening first ,of course!


Will you give this  request real consideration and say YES!


I would appreciate your answer as soon as you possibly can give it. As we
need to begin the next phase of the  planning asap.

Again, Please forgive my informal way of presenting this very important
Invitation!


Sincerly, Cheryl

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"2012 Olympics","
       As a follow-up to our meeting yesterday, I thought you might be interested in the attached letter that John Kelley just received from the Stuttgart, Germany group that is also bidding for the 2012 Olympics. 
       They were very impressed with the concept of converting the Astrodome to a track and field facility, and they evidently are considering a similar stadium as part of their bid for the 2012 Olympics. This seems to underscore the importance of Houston moving quickly to make the conversion of the Astrodome so that we do not lose our competitive advantage.

Encouragement Email 
Hello Friend, 
This is Dwayne Savaya. Your e-mail address was in my address book from a forward I received.  I am starting an Inspirational and Encouragement Mailing list. We all need some encouragement from time to time so that is why I am starting this new Ministry.  If you would like to be on it or know someone that would, just send an email to me with a SUBSCRIBE heading. These will be stories and poems to encourage and inspire you in your daily walk with the Lord.  This is completely free and you can unsubscribe at anytime. 
There is so much garbage being sent to us these days and I feel its time to start enjoying the email we receive and at least get something out of it like encouragement and inspiration. 
I don't want to clutter your E-mail box because I know you have a life and don't want to read mail all day long, so I will send you inspirational and encouraging stories and poems 2 to 3 times a week. 
I hope this will bring encouragement to many in this world full of trials and troubles.  I believe we need to spend more time thinking of life in a positive way and not worry about every problem that comes our way and simple stories of encouragement can do alot to help us have a better outlook on life. All Glory and Honor belongs to the Lord for the things He is doing.

"FW: With love from Oslo","This one brings tears to my eyes.

-----Original Message-----
From: Hanson, Mark
Sent: Friday, September 14, 2001 10:43 AM
To: All Users - Domestic
Subject: FW: With love from Oslo


We received this very touching message from the recently retired CFO of one
of the firm's clients.  The letter was authored by a British woman who lived
in Houston with her Norwegian husband for many years.


Dear friends:
It's almost midnight on Wednesday evening in Oslo, and I have just come home
from a walk down to the American Embassy, where I added my flowers and
candles to those already there.  I'd like to describe it to you:

* A perfect evening, very dark, but lots of stars, around 60 degrees, not a
breath of  wind.
* On one side of the street the embassy itself, where they were hard at work
adding a second row of concrete barriers.
* On the other side of the street, in front of the railings alongside the
palace grounds, a hundred yards or so of outpourings of sympathy from the
people of Oslo:
* Thousands of candles, all sizes, some standing alone, others arranged in
patterns - hearts, crosses, the letters USA.
* Bouquets of flowers of all kinds, from the simplest wildflowers to
beautiful bouquets.
* An exquisite wreath from the firefighters of Oslo.
* Norwegian and American flags
* Letters and cards in many languages.  Messages of hope, love, sympathy -
and outrage.
* Children's paintings and drawings - some depictng the horror of the plane
about to hit the tower with childlike simplicity, others showing children on
their knees praying for God to give America comfort.
* A placard with the words ""The Atlantic is a creek, our sympathy is an
oceen, America is the world.""
* Many, many people of all ages, walking slowly, reading the cards and
letters, and adding their own contributions.
* Not a sound to be heard, except for that of people trying to control their
tears.

It was extraordinarily beautiful, and incredibly moving.  I think it was the
utter silence that was the most powerful aspect.  The silence of grief and
mind-numbing outrage.

I thought you would like to know.

God bless you.

Love, Jan

"Upset stockholder","
I have found the events of the last two months to  be among the most unsettling in my 15 years of owning stock in public  companies.  I have sold my 1,800 shares of Enron Corp. because I no longer  have faith in the board to be a good watchdog for the best interests  of the shareholders.  I just don't understand how senior managers can  manipulate the financial results of the company for the past five years and only  recently be discovered.  I expect the board to act as more than a lap-dog  for senior management.  I am encouraged you turned down the chance to  accept a $60 million payday for this merger that salvages what little  shareholder value remains in Enron.  I would expect the board to seek  repayment of any and all bonuses paid to senior managers based on these  inaccurate financial results, including the estimated $30 million paid to the  CFO, who allegedly is the architect of this scheme to defraud  stockholders.  Had I known the company was apparently built on smoke and  mirrors, I would have sold my stock long ago and not be forced  to watch my  children's college fund be pocketed by executives who have little regard for the  stockholders they were hired to serve.  I guess the only lesson I can take  from this is that no company, no matter how large or prestigious is safe from  dishonest management.  I do not include you in this group, but I do believe  you and the board bear some blame for allowing this happen for the past five  years.

"Vote of Confidence","Mr. Lay-

With all that is going on, a quick note to let you know that you still have an employee who is confident something good will prevail and not all may be lost.  Though I have only been with the company for almost 2 years, I personally feel you are doing all you can to salvage what is possible.  Your reputation precedes you and the many years you spent building this company up. I feel deep down that you wouldn't have done anything to jeapordize your name despite what the media and finance markets read.  Responsibility is to be shared.  Unfortunately, you have been left to do the clean up.  I do believe in my heart of hearts that once Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow were in the positions they were, greed took over.  Unfortunately, they took advantage of your position and possibly lost sight of dealings going on with the presumption that these men were of the utmost, outstanding character.

Please view this email as simply a boost to your morale and not anything more than to simply advise you of what possibly many employees feel but have yet to convey.

"Urgent Message","Dear friend and colleague,

I am asking for a few minutes of your time and consideration.  But first I
pray that you did not have any loved ones who were victims of the Sept. 11th
tragedy.   I, like you, have been absorbing all of the discussions
surrounding the terrorist attacks.  I have never seen our country so
thoughtful, so questioning and so united.

But I must admit I am very concerned for the future and for the choices we
make as we move ahead.  While I fully understand and support the need for a
military response, I believe that the United States needs to take measures
to bring more stability, economic balance and good will to the world
community.

I am a businessman in Washington State.  In trade-reliant states such as
ours, we are increasingly aware of our interdependence with the rest of the
global economy, and the continuing need to nurture and grow emerging
markets.  It is good business and in our economic self-interest to help
reduce the disparity between wealthy and poor nations.

For the past 10 years I have worked on business solutions to poverty
alleviation in Central America. I have become increasingly aware of the
immense capacity of the US to share our knowledge, business know-how,
entrepreneurial skill and financial resources with poorer countries. My
involvement has convinced me that people who have hope for the future and an
economic stake in their community share our desire for economic stability
and productive societies.  Conversely, conditions of poverty and despair
breed hopelessness, violence and extremism.

Two unfortunate realities haunt me.  One is that fully half the people on
our planet are barely surviving on an income of $2 per day, and their
prospects for the future are dark indeed.  The second is that the United
States gives less per capita to international development efforts than any
other   industrialized nation.  At the same time, our defense budget is one
hundred and fifty times larger than our development assistance budget.

Of course, we need a strong and vigorous defense capability, but I believe
we also need to balance our response to the global economy by investing in
measures that will help close the growing gap between the haves and
have-nots.  Not only is it the humanitarian thing to do, it is also a way to
invest in preventative actions that will move us in the direction of
balanced growth, rather than violence, terrorism and global economic
instability.

Out of this crisis, I believe there is an opportunity to build truly
collaborative partnerships with other countries. Alongside our multilateral
military response to the events of September 11th, we should seek
multilateral efforts for increased political and economic support to poor
countries.

I hope that you will consider joining me in sending the following message to
your elected leaders
and decision makers, and to your friends and colleagues.

Sincerely,

Bill Clapp

				MESSAGE

The September 11th attack on the United States represents an assault not
only on the American people but also on the fundamental freedoms of our
democratic society.  In response, the United States government must weigh
all the necessary military options to protect its interests and defend our
citizens and territory.  I am writing this letter to you, our elected and
appointed officials, to express my encouragement and support for the
difficult decisions you must make in the months ahead.

As part of our national security and military response, I encourage you to
pay equal attention to the following longer-term strategies:

?	INCREASE U.S. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR POOR COUNTRIES:

As the leader of the free world, the United States should use the
opportunity created by this terrorist crisis to increase our commitment to
poor countries.  An enhanced effort to bridge the social and economic
inequities in the world will reap significant benefits in the form of
increased global stability and economic equity, and will help eliminate
conditions of despair and hopelessness that breed violence and extremism.

?	BUILD COALITIONS FOR GLOBAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EQUITY

There is strength in numbers.  The United States should build on the
emerging anti-terrorist coalition to address the longer-term challenges that
we must face together. Multilateral cooperation will add value and
credibility to any efforts we undertake by demonstrating our commitment to
shared values.

"Power Trading Group","Mr. Lay:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.  Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well!

Cindy and Kathy --

The United Way Board meeting went great this morning.  The Board was
enthusiastic about the One Houston United Campaign! I think they felt the
plan was well thought out and could generate excitement as well as
contributions within the community!  They liked the idea of any funds over
$4 million going to a United Way One Houston United Restricted Fund for
future emergencies like Allison.  They voted to have the entire United Way
Board as the volunteer committee too.

Thanks so much for all you are doing on this -- your leadership is making
things happen in a BIG way!  

More later!

"Difficult times","I just wanted to let you know that if there is anything I can do to help I am more than willing to do it.  These are difficult times and I am doing alot of floor meetings and table talks with the employees.  They clearly do not understand how we got into this situation and just want some face time with Management.  With the exception of NEPCO our fourth quarter looks good.  I have uncovered alot of issues with NEPCO that I do not think anyone knew existed.  I'll know more Friday after a businnes/budget review session.

Please let me know if I can help.

"","I needed to write this note to explain my situation
and a lack of response and candor from Enron
organization.

I received a phone call on Monday (12/3/01) afternoon
around 3:00 PM from my manager, under supervision and
instruction of a representative from Houston that I
had never heard of, telling me that my employment with
Enron was terminated, effective immediately, along
with several thousand others.  The representative
provided no customary information related to final
paycheck, severance packages, outstanding expenses
that I had incurred prior to termination, pay for
vacation that I had earned throughout the year, health
benefits, future employment assistance, etc.

This from what used to be the best company in the
world is so disheartening.  I will outline my
circumstances for you.

- I began my employment with Enron Energy Services on
January 24, 2000 as a Development Manager for the
Mid-West Region.
- I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering.
- I have been in the energy business for 20 years.
- I quickly became your number 1 developer in the
country during my first few months with the company.
- I was promoted to Director Development in January
2001.
- I continued outperforming many others with my
increased responsibilities.
- I was assigned as the Lead Developer for the Eli
Lilly deal, as well as development responsibilities
for Quebecor, Simon, Suiza, Quaker, and Harrah's.
- Any customer that I dealt with were completely
satisfied with my work.
- I support a wife and 4 children.
- I submitted an expense report a few days prior to my
termination in the amount of $2,666.42 for company
related expenses.  I used my own credit card for all
of these expenditure, not the American Express card. I
don't even have an American Express card.  My personal
credit card bill has arrived, but I don't have the
money from Enron to pay the bill.
- I have additional expenses where the bills are just
coming in and I have no idea how to submit them, or
whether I will even get paid if I did.
- I had 120 hours of earned vacation remaining for the
year that I had not used yet and I was entitled to.
- I was told by your e-mail and Alex Weiselburg to
report to work on Monday, 12/3 - which I did - and
therefore, it makes me entitled to that day of pay.

The bottom line is that I have had no communications
from anyone regarding my status for the items I have
listed in here. We were all your loyal employees.  If
we needed to get laid off (although up to the last
minute Alex was saying business as usual), so be it.
It is just so unfair to get kicked out under these
circumstances without any care in the world that we
are all human beings with families to support.

The least you could do is restore some of our dignity
by paying what was rightfully ours such as expenses,
back pay, earned vacation pay, and severance.  Also, a
little communication related to our health benefits
and transition to other programs, job search
assistance, etc. will be nice.  This is the first time
I have been laid off from anyplace and I have no
expertise in this field.  I don't think I am asking
for much.  If you were able to pay hundreds of
thousands to several ""key"" individuals to buy their
loyalty, you surely can afford to pay what is
rightfully mine.

I am very saddened by the dishonesty in the
organization and the way we have all been treated.  I
would appreciate it if you could at least respond to
my e-mail and let me know if there is anything for me
to look forward to.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"Golden Opportunity to Impact DOE/EERE Programs & Budget","Newly appointed Asst. Secretary for EERE, David Garman, is urgently seeking
input on the 31 programs administered by his department.

Do not miss this opportunity to provide written and/or oral comments on the
program objectives, deployment, and if programs are meeting their objectives
as well as recommendations for future objectives and implementation. [See
Public Notice Attached]. Your input will be used to help determine the
future of these programs, identify new programs, and provide the basis
hopefully for a DOE supplemental budget increase.

A.  Seven public meetings will be held around the country from June 12th  -
Jun 26th.  You should at a minimum submit your recommendations in writing to
DOE [instructions contained on page 2 of the announcement].
B.  Be as specific as possible and cite success stories as well as failures.
Brief comments are also welcome to show general support and/or need for
improvement or termination.  Please be as constructive as possible to help
restore funding for those programs you support.
C. Please provide me with copies of any written comments by email so the
Alliance can hopefully incorporate your suggestions in our written comments
as well.

This is one of the most important and timely opportunities you will have to
impact these programs.  Asst. Secretary Garman needs our input!  Feel free
to contact me with any questions by email or calling 202-530-2213.

"RE: Furniture!","Dear Family,

Just for everyone's information, there is no special dress code.  Dinner
will remain casual to casual/chic, as usual.  We have scheduled Allen Ross
to be there early in the evening to help us take a few very special group
photographs.  Because of this we are providing VERY SIMPLE NON-SCAREY
Halloween costumes for the wee ones to put on over their casual attire for
photos.

I don't want to make this a difficult or painful process and the costumes
will hopefully make it fun.  The most important photograph I am hoping to
get is with ""Pop-Pop and his six great grandchildren.""  If that goes well,
Pop-Pop will step out and Mamia and Papi will step in quickly to be
photographed with all of their precious grandchildren.  Then depending on
whether the wee ones can handle it and don't have melt down, we would also
love for the five children and spouses to quickly join in for a larger group
shot.  If it works, it works...and it doesn't, it doesn't.  NO BIG DEAL!
We'll just see how it goes.

If all goes well, once we have finished with our special photo session, any
of you who may want individual photographs taken are on your own to do so as
you wish.

I hope this answers all of the questions Barb's early e-mail might have
sparked.  If not, call me.

Love, Mamia

"Management & Leadership","Ken, Greg, Mark - 

Thank you for your leadership over the last several weeks and this morning.  We appreciate it.

Following are some additional thoughts and some more detail on my comments from this morning:

The leadership group in that room needs to feel the sense of responsibility to lead our businesses.  Everything we say & do - including all written, verbal and ""body language"" - are signals.  We must communicate and lead all day, every day.  
As an organization, and as part of our culture, we lead with our chin - always have and probably always will.  We are going to take our share of bumps and bruises.
We have some great businesses here....and we are fortunate.  We have grown the size and profitability of our core businesses substantially, and in a market where many companies have not been as successful.
Most of our wounds are self - inflicted.  We can and should do a better job.
I believe this leadership team needs to make an absolute commitment in the following areas:
Vision -  define what we want this company to be in the next 3-5 years
Value -    as part of building the World's Leading Company, my vote is that we dedicate our energy towards building long term, sustainable value.  This is not about just creating value in the eyes of Wall Street - this is about creating real value, perhaps as defined by ""after tax operating profit minus the real cost of capital"".  Market cap will follow this type of economic value creation.  We need to measure it and incent people this way.
Teamwork - we are a leadership team.  I don't feel as though everyone buys into that nor is it clear that everyone around that table feels a sense of responsibility to lead across the business.  I would like to discuss how we improve as a team.  Many of our employees (at an average age of 33 years) have never been through: 
an economic downturn
a global military conflict
problems like the ones we are currently experiencing at Enron
We need big time leadership now....from all who are around that table
Clear Demonstration of our leadership - in clear view of our employees, customers and shareholders
People - we must make sure to retain and enhance the interest of the employees that add value to Enron everyday.  These people need to believe - with our actions - that we are absolutely focused on making sure they have an environment that is conducive to building and creating value over the short, medium and long term.
The ball is in our court.  We have to lead and be perceived as credible leaders.  We've got to dig deep and get down the road - together.

If you wish, I would be pleased to discuss this further.

Thank you again for your leadership.  

Regards - Dan

"Dynegy Merger","Mr. Lay:

Congratulations doesn't seem quite right, but I do want to express my best
wishes over your recently announced merger with Dynegy. I am confident you have
made the best decision for the long term success of Enron's employees,
stockholders, and their families. The fact that you have chosen to unite with
annother quality Houston company also gives me confidence that leading edge
community involvement we have come to expect from both Enron, and Dynegy will
continue for years to come. Hopefully with both companies based here any job
loss can be minimized.

Best of luch to you, your family, and your Enron family !

Thankful for it all
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Have you ever considered that perhaps your difficulties come
to you precisely because you need them, because of what they
can teach you, because of how they will compel you to grow?
Imagine what would happen if you could look at your troubles
not as some sort of cruel and random punishment, but rather
as a potent form of empowerment.

Do you resent the difficulties in your own life? Why? What
purpose does that resentment serve? There is nothing of value
that it will bring you.

Resenting your troubles only makes them more troubling. It
only brings you down even more. On the other hand, finding a
way to appreciate those problems will help them become a
positive force in your life.

Gratitude will move your life positively forward not only when
you're grateful for your blessings but also when you're grateful
for your troubles. Find a way to be genuinely thankful for it
all, and the reality of your life will reflect that positive
and empowering focus.

Ralph Marston

"You Did a Good Job","Dear Mr. Lay:

In this trying time of second-guesses and angry shareholders, I wanted to let you know that I have appreciated working for you and share a quick story of how you shaped my view of Enron and the corporate world in general.

My second rotation as an associate was to write speeches for the Office of the Chairman.  Generally, I was creating presentations for Jeff Skilling, but I did create a couple for you as well.  The one I remember best was for the speech at Astro Hall for the Houston Energy Conference where we announced Enron Online.  Not only did you let me lead the internal roundtable (I remember sitting at the table, trying to keep my composure as Greg Whalley, Dan Leff, Louise Kitchen and others asked specifics about the slides I created), but you also (generally) agreed with my answers and thanked me for a job well done.  That night, I shared a bottle of champagne with my wife and truly believed I could do anything!!

So, as far as I am concerned, you have done a tremendous job.  Everything happening now is unfortunate.  It happened on your watch and thus is partly your responsibility.  But you have stepped up to the plate, most likely saved more jobs than lost, and been accountable in more ways than one.  Being a leader in good times and in bad, and more importantly affecting the lives of your employees on a personal basis, are truly attributes that I hope to continue in my lifetime.

I just wanted you to know that you have truly made a difference in one man's career.  And I feel all the better for it.

My prayers go to you and your family.

Best regards,

Michael Harris

"Free Trade vs. States' Rights Event","Dear Sir or Madam,

The FEDERALISM PROJECT at the American Enterprise Institute cordially invites you to attend this upcoming event.
Your RSVP is required by June 15th (acceptances only); please email kkosman@aei.org or phone (202) 862-4883.

Free Trade vs. States' Rights:
Globalization and the Challenge to Local Democratic Government

Tuesday, 26 June 2001, 12:00 p.m.

Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI, 1150 Seventeenth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036

Even as America is experiencing a revival of states' rights, globalization has begun to strain domestic federalism arrangements. State policymakers are finding their authority constrained by the rules of international trade organizations. At the same time, the states' increasingly active role in foreign policy is making it more difficult for the United States to project a single, coherent policy in the international arena. Are federalism and globalization headed for a collision? How should we reconcile the conflicting values of economic efficiency, state autonomy, and democratic governance? How should states respond to the challenges of globalization? What role should the federal government play in ensuring that international organizations (such as the WTO) and global capitalism do not undermine state autonomy? Mark Gordon - whose paper ""Democracy's New Challenge: Globalization, Governance, and the Future of American Federalism"" will soon be released by Demos - will be joined in the discussion by Michael Greve and two distinguished guest panelists.

"ENRON SITUATION","Mr. Lay,
 
I have been with Enron for 33 years. I have found these years to have been interesting, to say the least, and have seen many changes during this time. I am proud to be part of an aggressive, growing company. And I have always had a high regard for the people driving the company.
 
I am now 60 years of age and I have been contemplating retirement and ""pursuing other interests"" as they say, with my remaining years. Imagine my despair at the state of affairs Enron has fallen to through what appears to be gross mismanagement. What was once envisioned as ""those comfortable golden years"" are now simply smoke. And after giving many of my years to this company it is devastating. It is hard for me to understand how this could happen without the knowledge of those of you at the head of the company, in my mind it was a ""look the other way"" situation without concern for anyone but yourselves and all that money for the fancy house, fancy cars, travel, etc. 
 
I will never understand everything that took place and why. I am certainly not alone in these feelings. But I would hope that Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow and others involved in this travesty have as much trouble sleeping at night as I do.

"XENEL RECEPTION","								January 8, 2002

Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Enron
USA

Dear Ken,

RECEPTION  on Thursday, 31st January, 2002

Once again, it's Davos time - as you know, this year World Economic Form is holding its annual  meeting in New York between 31 January - 4 February 02.

As it is a strange and unfamiliar ground for some of us, I thought it appropriate to invite you,  on behalf of my brothers,  Mohamed and Abdullah, and myself, for a small closed cocktail reception Xenel is holding on Thursday, 31st January at Waldorf Towers between 7.00 pm and 9.45 pm to meet with you to exchange views early on the session.   This event will also give us the opportunity to meet, and interact with WEF Council members and its management, Saudi Arabian participants as well as some of our close friends.

I very much hope that you will be able to join us for the reception. I look forward to hearing from and seeing you again.


Wishing you a very happy and prosperous 2002.


Warm personal regards,

"To Brighten Your Day","Dear Ken -

Please don't be heartbroken about the value of anyone's portfolio or stand in line to beat yourself up about it (again).  
  
Contrary to popular opinion, there is nothing that Enron executives or Wall Street analysts can do to ruin anyone's future.  The ""portfolio problem"" is not loss of value, rather lack of values--people need to get some personal values that are worth a damn!  

I know our current scenario wasn't a part of your vision for Enron, but stockholder anxiety just shows that most people are spiritual morons.  God promises to take care of each and every one of us under absolutely every circumstance.  People choose to ignore this; in doing so, they reject His blessings in favor of their own worries.  So be it. 

You are not responsible for how we (stockholders) choose to react/respond to life's exigencies.  Certainly we might wish you had ""chosen vanilla,"" but no financial loss is appropriate cause for anyone to feel devastated and come whining to you.  So we're down a few $ billion - this is so piddling!  God has ""umpty-zillion"" in money + much more important stuff to make up this perceived loss.   

I sincerely hope you can find some comfort in these thoughts.  

Betty

P.S.
I am very grateful for your staying with us; I know the going is extremely tough for you these days.

"thought you might be interested in this alliance with AOL TW","
Ken,
 
I am emailing in the hopes of having an opportunity  to talk if you are interested in the following possibility -- AOL Time Warner  has given us a great opportunity to spotlight the organizations that are  providing systemic responses to 9-11 (not just relief efforts) so that these  organizations cannot be left cold by the shadow of the American Red Cross  but that they instead can receive support at this critical time.   
 
Below is what I sent to AOL TW in response to  their invitation for the work described below and their great offer to feature  us on their site and www.libertyunites.org .  I wanted to  talk with you because AOL TW and I want to know if you can join AOL TW and  support this initiative.
 
If possible, please let me know if we can talk  sometime soon.  Thanks for considering this.
 
Jim
---------- 
In the wake of the events of September  11,  the generosity of individuals, foundations and businesses has never been more  evident.  The response to Sept. 11 has begun to shift from a ""relief""  effort to efforts that address the systemic changes that are needed for societal  conditions to improve.  Now more than ever, social investors will be  looking for organizations that address both the root causes of social problems  and create sustainable social change.  At this time, the American Red Cross  continues to be deluged with support; but what about the organizations that live  in the shadow of the Red Cross?  The Red Cross and similar  organizations are doing outstanding work when they are needed most -- now  other organizations are moving beyond the immediate relief efforts of feeding,  clothing, housing the victims and are recognizing that there are new or  exacerbated problems that have been stirred up by Sept.  11.
 
For  example, there are numerous organizations protecting civil liberties, providing  counseling, preparing communities for future disasters, and assisting displaced  workers:
organizations, such as the Ella Baker Center for  Human Rights, are stepping up their efforts to combat racial profiling that  has begun and is leading to the harassment of people who look of Middle  Eastern descent;  
organizations are supporting this same constituency  when they are the victims of hate crimes that have been perpetrated as a  backlash to September 11.  
children are in need of counseling as a result of  their personal fears or fears for their parents and  family;  
organizations, such as Operation USA, are  recruiting and deploying counselors trained in post-traumatic  stress to areas where needed; 
efforts are underway to enhance community  preparedness for acts of terrorism in their communities (such as evacuation  procedures); and  
organizations, such as Career Gear, are assisting  low-income workers who lost their jobs as a result of Sept. 11 and now need  career counseling, appropriate interview clothing and job retention services  so they do not fall into the spiral of welfare.  (Please note that each  of the organizations mentioned above are SeaChange  members).

These  are just a few examples among many efforts that have commenced to respond to the  call for change and not just service.  Life will never be the same.   These organizations are working to see that it will in fact be better.   But, unfortunately, they are not known by most philanthropists, foundations or  businesses.  In fact, we have heard from organizations that some businesses  are pulling back from commitments to these smaller organizations to associate  with the larger organizations providing rescue, relief and recovery  services.  These lesser-known organizations, who are doing critical social  change work, need to feel the philanthropic winds in their sails too so they can  make progress toward much needed change.
 
Many funds have been created to earmark money for  the Sept. 11 response, but the recipients of a significant portion of those  monies have not yet been identified.  Companies have, for example, set  aside several million dollars and have earmarked half or more for the Red Cross,  but still have not decided what to do with the rest of the funds.  For  these Funds, for www.helping.org  and  www.libertyunites.org , and for social  investors in our network, SeaChange is uniquely positioned to become the source  of information of organizations that are moving beyond relief efforts and  are focused on the systemic changes necessary for conditions to improve.   On their behalf, SeaChange can directly approach the administrators of these  Funds and other social investors to make them aware of these overlooked change  organizations.  
 
The mission of SeaChange is to connect  entrepreneurial nonprofits with resources for sustainable social  change.  We will do just that by spotlighting the very organizations that  can have an impact not only today, but tomorrow as well.   For social investors, we will provide them with detailed  information about a broad menu of screened organizations working to effect  social change not only in response to Sept. 11 but also in response to the  changed environment in which we now live.  SeaChange also provides these  potential supporters with an easy way to search for organizations that meet  their giving specifications. Additionally, they can be notified of organizations  that meet their criteria -- doing all of this anonymously if they choose  to.   And, as discussed above, we will not only do this online, but  offline as well by advocating to various Fund adminstrators.   As  a result, SeaChange will effectively and efficiently connect those who are  seeking support at this critical time with those who are looking to give their  support.

"CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISION","Mr. Lay,
 
I wrote you a few days ago concerned about the news articles describing the amount of money passing to top management during Enron's crisis. 
 
This morning I received an e-mail that states you are going to forgo the payment under the Change of Control Provision which amounted to between $60 to $80 million depending on which article you read. I want to commend you on this decision which most likely would not have been made by a lesser man. Your credibility and your personal integrity have both gone up a notch in my estimation.

I have attached a copy of a letter that I have sent to certain members of Congress.  
Charge on & Best of luck

	Mary, 

	I wanted to let you know how impressed I was with the manner in which Aaron Brown facilitated and managed the preparation of the Purchase, Sale & Reconveyance Agreement for Mr. and Mrs. Lay. In only a few day time, he followed thought in the preparation of the document and coordination of multiple counsel, including in-house and  outside counsel for all parties for review of the document. He solicited comments from all the necessary parties, managed the detail of the transaction and kept the document  on track for  closing on Friday morning. I have to commend him on his efforts in this regard. Job well done.

Subject:	THIS IS A SURVEY - ONE QUESTION


To answer your survey question,  I don't need these services period! I will not use the click at home portal. I wish I could.  If I could send my computer back and recover all the monies I've  lost because of click at home  I would!  WHY? Click at home promised broad band to all employes. As of this date no attempt to provide that service to people like myself has been made. How can I make such a statement? Because broadband has been available in my area via satellite since the birth of click at home and I still do not have a subsidized service! A basic internet line is just too slow to justify doing business at home!  I purchased this computer with the understanding that broadband service would be available to us. I know I live in a rural area of north west Florida, but the technology is available in this area. So why haven't we been subsidized? 
 
Thanks,
Frank Acuff

"Campus Mail Advisory:  On-Campus Mail Distribution RESUMES (11/14	/01)","Update on Mail Distribution:

On Campus Mail Distribution Resumes

On-campus mail distribution resumed this afternoon (11/14/01). Initial
distribution may be slow
but is expected to pick up as mail that had been stored in a secured campus
facility is processed.
Pending the reopening of the University's Main Post Office in the
Administration Building, the mail
sorting and distribution activity is taking place at an alternate site in
the University Service Center.

University facilities that receive mail directly from the United States Post
Office will continue
to receive and process mail.  The test results were negative for the East
(Divinity) Campus mail facility
and mail distribution for that Campus resumed this afternoon.  The West
(Law) Campus is processing
mail from an alternate location while they await the results of tests taken
at their main processing
location.

With the exception of Meridian Hill Hall, for which results are pending, the
off-campus dormitories
also received negative test results and this afternoon reactivated
distribution from their usual locations.

"Moody's and Standard & Poor's","Two conference calls have been tenatively scheduled to allow you to directly discuss Enron's commitment to its credit ratings with senior managers at Standard & Poor's and Moody's (Ben Glisan will join you in your office at the times detailed below).  Both agencies have been briefed on the contents of next week's earnings release as well as the pending equity adjustment associated with the Raptor transactions.  On Monday, our analysts at both agencies will be briefing their rating committees on the Enron announcement.  They will then contact us with their official rating decision.  Andy, Ben and I feel that a proactive call from you today will positively impact the message our analysts deliver to their committees.

Based upon the discussions with the analysts held over the last two days it is apparent that several key assurances from Enron senior management are sought.  They are as follows:

Enron is Committed to Maintaining its Credit Ratings - emphasize that the ratings are critical to the fundamental businesses which drive our success, gas and power marketing.  Note that both our counterparties and creditors place great weight on our consistent rating profile.  Due to this, the agencies should be confident that we will aggressively defend the ratings.
Our Core Businesses are Strong - We are the leading franchise in energy marketing.  We anticipate continued strength in the financial performance from the commodity groups.  No charges to be taken are associated with our ongoing businesses.
Portland General and Other Asset Sales will Occur - Proceeds from these divestitures are material and will be applied first to allow us to get our leverage statistics back in line quickly.  
Reemphasize Your Commitment To Simplifying Financial Reporting - The analysts have given considerable consideration to you public statements associated with providing more detailed information to the financial community regarding our performance.  
Acknowledge Remaining Issues Facing the Company - The agencies are following the developments on Dhabol, the valuation of the EBS fiber optic network, and the ongoing Azurix/Wessex performance.  Provide comfort that we believe the ultimate resolution of these items will not have a material adverse impact on our credit.

If you have any questions or comments, Ben will join you 15 minutes prior to the first call.

"A suggestion","Mr. Lay,
 
I have recently begun my 19th year at Enron.  Yesterday, I was one of the ""lucky"" employees who was given the opportunity to stay.  Fortunately for me and my family, I also received an offer with another company yesterday, and I have accepted that offer.  Today is my last day here, and the only sadness I feel is for the thousands of good people who have been let down and let go.
 
I have a suggestion.  I feel strongly that you should promptly have the ""values"" banners removed from the Enron building lobby.  Communication, respect, excellence, and integrity have not been practiced here, except by the thousands of non-executive employees who were told to live those values, and believed in them.  It is a slap in the face of every employee, laid off or still here, who walks into that lobby and sees them hanging there.

"Words of Encouragement","Dear Mr. Lay,

I am a former Enron employee who voluntarily resigned from Enron in August
of this year to spend more time with my two young children, Avery, 2 1/2 and
Nate, 17 months.  These past few weeks have been devasting for a lot of
people.  I personally have lost over $40,000 in my 401K which I was heavily
investing in Enron stock since my first day there, February 1998.  I also
lost all of my children's college funds, $10,000.  But, I am one of the
lucky ones, I know.

The reason for this note is just to say that I think very highly of you and
know what a GOOD person you are.  I was fortunate enough to have seen you on
the Crystal Cathedrial a while back, and I know that you are a caring
Christian man.  Thanks for all your efforts to save the company.

I just thought you'd like to hear some nice words from an employee rather
than all the trash from the media!

Sincerely,

Shelly Michalk

"Prayer Journal","
Mr. Lay, 
The scripture today was from Psalms 7 through Psalms 10. I am so overwhelmed with what God is showing me. I so hope you are being ministered to. 
I just heard from a friend that you are apparently going to have to appear in court. I don't know if this is true but the message is still the same. God loves you. I know that you, maybe above all the rest, KNOW that. Minister to the others that know Him. Pray for them, with them. They need to know the One that we know.
I am glad I heard so that I may pray for you specifically. 
12/7/01: Lord, all through this You have shown me over and over your holiness but most of all, more than all, Your grace. You lead me to confess this morning that I have not trusted the hand of God because I didn't really trust the heart of God. In all of this, You have shown me Your heart. By showing me Your heart for one of Your children in trouble, grave trouble, You have made me know You. How could I deny a Father that has such kindness towards His children? One that does NOT accuse us but says ""Come to me, I will give you rest. I will save you. It gives me pleasure to give you the Kingdom."" 
Lord, Mr. Lay, probably already knows all of this and maybe this has all been for me. All I know is that more than ever, I come before You on behalf of my brother, Ken. You, above all others, know every thought, every fear, every doubt, every arrow from the enemy that has made its way through. Every verse that you have uttered into my heart has been about how you love him. How you delight in him. How you do not condemn him. How you see the righteous acts he has done. Maybe even from seeds sown in his life long ago - I don't know - but You have shown me certainly that this is the God I want to give my whole heart to. I don't want to hold anything back anymore, ever again. I am in love with you, Jesus. I thank you for the emphasis on the verse about how You will MAKE us love YOU with all our hearts, souls, minds, and strength. 
Do that for Mr. Lay, Lord. Do that for him. Pour out Your Spirit on him so that he can't help but completely give up to this God of his. This God that has never left him-will never leave him. This Father that says ""I delight in you"". This Bridegroom that says, ""I promise to take care of all your needs. I want you with me for the rest of my life"". This Son given to us as a baby. Laid at the feet of mankind as The Lamb offering that God required. Like You lead Abraham to prophesy so many years before ""And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together"" (Genesis 22:8). Lord, YOU ALONE ARE WORTHY OF OUR PRAISE. Thank you. In Jesus name.

Sent:	Thursday, November 01, 2001 12:15 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Daily Update


Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"POWER BRIEFS - May 25, 2001","
POWER BRIEFS
FRIDAY, MAY 25, 2001



NEWPOWER IN THE NEWS  -   
PULLING PLUG ON TXU IS A BRIGHT IDEA - [Fort Worth Star-Telegram, May 17.]  NewPower, 43 percent owned by the Houston energy powerhouse Enron, is the price leader [for householders] who keep the home lights fully ablaze. Reliant Energy, corporate kin to Houston Power and Light, is the price leader for frugal homeowners?New Power offers power users a choice of locking in power rates at 8.3 cents for two years subject to a $7.50 monthly service fee, or accepting a guarantee that their power bills will always be less than TXU's comparable bite for the same period. For the moment, the low-price guarantee plan sports the lowest rates?""We're trying to figure out what customers want,"" says Gael Doar, a NewPower spokeswoman. ""The whole thing about energy restructuring is that you have a choice."" To date, the PUC has recruited 17 percent of the 90,000 volunteers it hopes will become TXU exes this summer.   One result is sweeter deals. New Power will toss in free electricity this December and next to folks who sign up by May 31.  On Wednesday, a New Power sales representative tossed in a $25 gift certificate at Home Depot if I'd sign up on the spot.

A FLICKERING PILOT - [Houston Chronicle, May 20.] NewPower Co., a partnership of Houston-based Enron Corp., America Online and IBM, is mailing various offers to homes, including one for free Continental Airlines frequent-flier miles, while Green Mountain Energy Co., which sells only wind-produced power in the state, has set up information booths at local events such as the Texas Crawfish Festival? Separate slots were also reserved for commercial and industrial customers to participate in the pilot. In many areas statewide, a lottery was held because more than enough nonresidential customers signed up.  ""Businesses make these kinds of decisions all the time, whether it be coffee or copiers. They will switch if there is economic value,"" said Tim Vail, NewPower's vice president of energy technology solutions. ""Consumers have a different view, much more of an emotional sale.""

CLEVELAND MAYOR PROPOSES NATURAL GAS SAVINGS  - [Cleveland Plain-Dealer, May 22.] Tens of thousands of Cleveland residents would save about $100 on natural gas next winter under a cooperative-buying arrangement proposed yesterday by Mayor Michael R. White. As proposed, the discounted natural gas would come from the New Power Co. The city identified New Power as a gas supplier with operating licenses in 19 states and 630,000 customers. The proposal was praised by Councilman Michael O'Malley, chairman of council's Public Utilities Committee. O'Malley said he expected the the City Council to approve the deal with New Power. http://www.cleveland.com/cuyahoga/plaindealer/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/cuyahoga/9905238071687131.xml 

NEWPOWER, AMPO TARGET OHIO  - [Gas Daily, May 22.] A venture of The New Power Company and AMPO will co-brand a new marketing program targeting residential and small commercial customers who wish to pool their volumes for a better gas price in Ohio.  See p. 5 on the following link: http://home.enron.com/pubs/gasdaily/data/gasdaily.05.22.2001.pdf 

CUYAHOGA FALLS HOOKS CITY UP WITH GAS PLAN - [Akron Beacon Journal, May 22.] Fifty-six percent of Cuyahoga Falls natural gas customers who did not sign up for one of the many discount rate plans offered beginning last summer will have a chance to do so. 
The city has reached an agreement with American Municipal Power-Ohio (AMP-Ohio), its electricity supplier, to allow residents to sign up for a reduced natural gas rate beginning June 25, Mayor Don Robart announced yesterday.  To do so, AMP-Ohio is working with NewPower, a New York-based independent company that supplies natural gas to more than 630,000 residential and small commercial customers. http://www.ohio.com/all/2001/May/22/newsdocs/002572.htm 

AMP-OHIO DEAL MAY SET A PATTERN FOR NEWPOWER ADVANCES - [Restructuring Today, May 23.]  American Municipal Power - Ohio in Columbus, has 10 customers that serve 85 cities and towns - some as large as Columbus and Cleveland - and 10 industrials.  A subsidiary of the joint action agency, AMPO Inc, has embarked on a two-year venture with The New Power Co to co-brand a gas aggregation program for residents and small businesses throughout the 85 jurisdictions to leverage group buying power of the consumers. NewPower's David Eichinger hopes to develop similar deals. 	He finds AMPO ""a treat to work with"" and we suggested that if the deal goes well, NewPower may open doors to the public power community for aggregation. AMPO sells less than $4 million in power annually at retail but sells $216 million at wholesale. The City of Cleveland in a related agreement will work with NewPower to offer a low, fixed-cost plan for the coming heating season. Given the natural gas price spikes of the past winter it looks like AMPO and NewPower may have an attractive package.  Eichinger thinks that the reason markets are opening up is to provide the public with the best deal and the most innovative services.  ""Forward thinkers like AMPO are going to be great for us to work with,"" Eichinger observed. What about selling electricity with AMPO?  ""Absolutely,"" he replied. Working with AMPO helps NewPower build brand and a presence, he noted.  Add to that an endorsement to sell all of the products and services including new technologies.


OTHER ENERGY NEWS - NewPower shares news items weekly to inform employees about coverage of the energy industry.  Publication of a news clip is not an endorsement of its viewpoint or accuracy.

UTILITIES TINKERING WITH PRICING PLANS - [Atlanta Journal & Constitution, May 20.] Retail prices are regulated in most parts of the country. But when utilities pay more for wholesale power, they have to pass it on. How much prices rise depend partly on whether we learn, again, to conserve. http://www.accessatlanta.com/partners/ajc/epaper/editions/sunday/business_b3702523015142660068.html 

ADMINISTRATION REJECTS CARTER-ERA SACRIFICES, SUGGESTING COMMON SENSE - [Associated Press, May 20.] Bush's blueprint relies on more energy supplies and a basket of enticements for greater energy efficiency. In his speech introducing it, he called conservation ""the result of millions of good choices made across our land on a daily basis,"" and asked for no hard choices in particular.  Rozanne Weissman, speaking for the Alliance to Save Energy, was not surprised. ""Americans do not want sacrifice and deprivation,"" she said. http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/business/energy/915261 

'SMART' METERS MAY EASE BEATING METE OUT BY ENERGY PRICES - [Boston Globe, May 21.]  Proponents of electricity deregulation insist that introducing market competition to the once-quintessential monopoly industry will save people money in the long run. But a big, still largely unsolved challenge of electric deregulation involves something fundamental to successful markets: accurate, timely prices for the product that consumers can respond to in the classic supply-demand dance. http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/141/business/_Smart_meters_may_ease_beating_mete_out_by_energy_prices+.shtml 

PG&E TARGETS BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO CONSUME LESS - [IndustryClick, May 21.] In conjunction with its customer education campaign called ""The More You Know About Conserving Energy, the Less Energy You Need,"" Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has stepped up its efforts to update business customers on the energy crisis and provide tools to help them conserve energy-especially in the coming months when power shortages are likely. http://www.telecomclick.com/magnewsarticle.asp?newsarticleid=201641&magazineid=11 

PARTNERSHIP TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS; SUPPLIERS OF POWER, GAS WILL BE SELECTED  - [Richmond Times-Dispatch, May 23.] A partnership called the Virginia Energy Team will run the advertising and education programs needed to get consumers ready for competition among power and natural gas suppliers. Teaching consumers about deregulation and how to choose a power supplier is considered critical if the pricing of power is to be turned over to market forces without harming consumers. The SCC has planned a five-year, $30 million education program. Efforts also will be made to reach people directly, such as through community groups. Small-scale grants will be available to groups to help them conduct consumer education. http://www.timesdispatch.com/business/MGB5IY5Z0NC.html 

ONLY 11 PERCENT SAY THEY HAVE BEEN GREATLY INCONVENIENCED BY ENERGY WOES - [Associated Press, May 23.]  Seventy-five percent of Californians say the state's energy woes have become a very serious problem, but so far only 11 percent say they have been greatly inconvenienced by power blackouts, according to a new poll.  Thirty-two percent said they have been inconvenienced some or a little by blackouts. Fifty-seven percent said they experienced no inconvenience or had not been hit by a power outage. http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/california/stories_statebrk/powerpoll_20010522.htm 

TXU TO DIVIDE DEREGULATED, REGULATED UNITS WITHIN FIRM - [Dallas Morning News, May 22.]  TXU Corp., owner of the state's largest utility, plans to further separate its regulated power delivery business from its power generation and energy trading business, chief executive Erle Nye told analysts Monday. Deregulation will allow residential consumers to choose their electricity provider for the first time in generations. ""Investor-owned"" utilities such as Dallas-based TXU Corp.'s TXU Electric will also be able to compete for customers outside their service areas for the first time. Its power delivery business, which includes the poles and wires that transmit electricity, will continue to be regulated. http://www.dallasnews.com/business/stories/373364_TXU_22bus.ART.html 

TEXAS TO EASE INTO NEW PILOT - Houston Chronicle, May 22.] The PUC has decided that electric customers enrolled in Texas' upcoming pilot market will be switched to new retail electric providers (REPs) gradually this summer in the interest of  optimal operation of all necessary systems. http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CoWNKqaicse8TrevsruC&FQ=%22ERCOT%22&Nav=na-search-&StoryTitle=%22ERCOT%22

CONSUMER GROUPS SAY GPU CASE CRITICAL TO RATEPAYERS -  [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 22.] The Public Utility Commission is expected to consider a case that could affect the future of electricity deregulation in Pennsylvania.  After being hit with significant losses, GPU Energy, an electric utility with customers in the Erie area and in pockets throughout Pennsylvania, has asked the PUC for permission to increase its rates beyond the caps it agreed to when electric deregulation began.  Consumer groups fear that if the PUC allows GPU Energy to do this, it will prompt other utilities to seek a rollback of rate caps that have helped protect Pennsylvanians from the soaring electric bills that have Californians reeling.

ASSEMBLY FORMS ENERGY PLAN - [Albany Times Union, May 22.] Assembly Democrats plan to unveil a comprehensive energy package today that will promote conservation efforts, provide rate relief and enhance consumer protections.  The bills, to be outlined by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Energy Committee Chairman Paul Tonko, include a measure to set up a block of discounted power for consumers -- the first 200 kilowatts on a monthly bill, according to some sources. The average New York consumer uses 300 kilowatts.  Also, a bill is planned that would protect consumers from requirements of energy service companies.

NATIONAL ENERGY MARKETERS ASSOCIATION CALLS FOR TARGETED INCENTIVES FOR NEW SUPPLIES, CONSERVATION, INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY - [NEM Press Release, May 22.] The National Energy Marketers Association (NEM), responding to the Administration's Energy Plan and the Democrat's Response is issuing an urgent call for bipartisan support for meaningful incentives for massive new investments in additional energy supplies, conservation, infrastructure and technology.

SITHE RETURNS FIRE ON NSTAR - [Boston Herald, May 22.] Sithe Energies yesterday forcefully denied a claim by NSTAR that it overcharged customers $70 million for electricity during times of peak demand and blamed NSTAR for causing the problems.  NSTAR last week accused power generators Sithe and PG&E National Energy Group of overcharging for electricity last year when congested transmission lines made it tough to get cheaper outside power. It also asked regulators to cap prices. NSTAR, the successor to Boston Edison, Commonwealth Electric and other power companies, plans a rebate to customers if it wins back the $70 million. http://www.bostonherald.com/business/business/powr05222001.htm

CONSUMER RIGHTS CITED IN PETITION WITH TEXAS PUC  - [Houston Chronicle, May 23.] Residential consumers switching power companies under a pilot deregulation program aren't being properly informed of their rights, four consumer groups said Tuesday. Consumers Union, Texas Legal Services Center, Texas Ratepayers' Organization to Save Energy and the AARP Capital City Task Force for Deregulation of Electricity filed a petition Tuesday with the PUC.  In it, they asked the PUC to require electric providers to fix their documents, to take any other action needed to clear up consumer confusion that may be occurring, and to develop a standard document format for providers to use.  They also ask that the PUC's education campaign better inform consumers of their rights. http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/printstory.hts/business/918674 

US LAWMAKERS PLEDGE TO COOPERATE ON ENERGY POLICY INITIATIVES - [Oil & Gas Journal Online, May 24.] Partisanship is being left at the door when it comes to energy policy, key energy lawmakers and Bush administration officials pledged Thursday. At a Senate energy panel hearing Thursday, featuring Energy Sec. Spencer Abraham, there was already a clear acknowledgement that the new Senate makeup will require the two political parties to be more open to compromise if energy legislation is to move forward this summer. Abraham stressed, ""We start from a wide base of agreement. We all recognize energy as a critical challenge. Both the chairman and ranking member of this committee have sponsored robust energy bills, and I am struck by how much common ground there is between these bills and our proposals.""  Bingaman also concurred that his bill ""has many areas in common"" with the others and added that ""we need to identify"" areas of mutual agreement. http://ogj.pennnet.com/articles/web_article_display.cfm?Section=OnlineArticles&ARTICLE_CATEGORY=TOPST&ARTICLE_ID=102093 

MEDIA QUOTE OF THE WEEK:  There's been a lot of talk from some of our critics that somehow the only focus is on additional supplies. . . . That's simply not true,"" declared Cheney.

OF INTEREST * * * ""OW, SUMMER'S COMING"" - NEWPOWER DEBUTS NEW TEXAS PRINT ADS
	Beginning June 1, TXU, HL&P and other Texas investor-owned utilities must offer customer choice for up to five percent of their electrical load.  To date, NewPower has captured an average of roughly 40 percent of the available marketshare in the TXU/HL&P service territories.  We can, however, continue to sign up customers for the pilot as long as slots are available. 
	Last weekend, new NewPower advertisements began appearing the Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle.  These ads (click twice on pdf attachments below) will continue to run on weekends and on a few key weekdays over the next four to six weeks.  NewPower's lead product in Texas is the Guaranteed Savings Plan, offering consumers a guaranteed savings over the utility provider.  Another offer, the Peace of Mind Plan, locks in a fixed rate for two years.
	The Texas pilot will end when full regulation begins on January 1, 2002.

"THANK YOU","Dear Mr. Lay,
I just want to send you a note to say thank you for all you've done for Enron.  I've been with Enron for 15 years (straight out of college).   I may have been impacted financially with what is currently going on but I certainly don't blame you nor anyone for that matter.  It just is.  Thanks to Enron, I have had a very good job for the last 15 years.  This might be the only company I've known but I do have friends that work at other company and this I know.  Not all companies give employees bonuses, stock options, ESOP, upward mobility, matching retirement funds, cash accounts, competitive salary, challenging work environment, on-site health care, on-site workout place, subsidized cafeteria, matching gift giving, involvement in charitable work and community, and many other good things.  I know that you and Enron have always care for the employees and for the community.  

In this time of crises, I'm sure there will be criticism no matter what you do but please do not pay attention because your family and friends and I'm sure many employees know that you are an honest and classy person with much integrity.  

THANK YOU ALWAYS.

This is the first analysis of 'Twingate'  that points out the obvious. John Williams exposes the exploitation of an unfortunate incident by two Austin  promoters who are also Democrat activist. The conduct of  the teenage twins is indefensible; Chuy's  conduct is outrageous.  
 
The girls made a silly mistake; Chuy's made a calculated grab for commercial promotion, at best, and engaged in despicable dirty political activity at worst.Chuy's smug press release confirms either or both conclusions.
 
The twins will pay a price for their conduct. I hope every parent, conservative, and other decent Texans that abhors shameless exploitation of the underage girls, will ensure that Chuy's pays a price for their conduct.
 
I will not set foot in Chuy's and ask that everyone with a sense of decency join in expressing their outrage at Chuy's despicable conduct. In Texas we have the choice of an abundance of Tex-Mex in less hostile environments.

The emergency? Two underage women wanted alcoholic beverages. One had an I.D. of another person old enough to drink.   It may be the first time a restaurant has considered underage drinking worthy of an emergency call in the home of the state's biggest university, said Becky Stewart, emergency services director for the Capital Area Planning Council. CAPCO manages Austin's regional 911 system.   But the two in question had familiar names. They were Jenna and Barbara Bush, the president's 19-year-old twin daughters.   Perhaps the call is understandable. No big-dollar restaurant wants to risk its liquor license by serving alcohol to someone under 21.   Tip for newsmen questionable  The second call from Chuy's management, however, is harder to defend.  Chuy's tipped the Austin American-Statesman to the scoop about the president's partying scofflaws. Amid deadline pressure and ethical questions, the newspaper didn't print a report until Thursday.   By then, the Bush family affair, rightly or wrongly, was everybody's business. It went international. Chuy's was mentioned in newspapers worldwide.   ""That can't be bad for business,"" mused an Austin political consultant and frequent Chuy's diner.   The success story of the restaurant chain may shed a little more light.   Chuy's was started by Michael Young and John Zapp in a city that loves its Mexican food. Young has been the main mover and shaker, helping expand the restaurant chain to Houston, Dallas, Arlington and San Antonio, and starting other profitable businesses.   Described by one friend as having a Willie Nelson grin, Young is a laid-back Austin denizen and minor Democratic player in Travis County politics.   Young has strong opinions and occasionally attends party fund-raisers, though acquaintances said he has not taken front-line positions on any major issues.   He has an amazing ability to get attention for his restaurant.   When Kenneth Starr was investigating the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair, Chuy's sold more than 1,000 T-shirts with a cartoon of Clinton shaking his finger and saying, ""I did not have Tex-Mex with that woman.""   Young also appeared for free in a Southwest Airlines commercial with the airline's legendary boss, Herb Kelleher. Young got the gig, which garnered free publicity for his restaurants, through adman Roy Spence, a friend and business partner who runs in Democratic circles.   Last year, Spence and Young joined others to create Glazing Saddles Ltd., which owns the Krispy Kreme doughnut shops in Austin and San Antonio.   ""I like Michael because he has built a culture where his people do the right thing, they are a big family,"" Spence said. ""His people serve the customers right, they prepare the food right, they take care of business right.""   Twins' actions hard to explain  Was it right to dial 911? Many eateries might have refused to serve the Bush daughters and left it at that.   The twins' behavior is likewise hard to defend or explain. The incident came two weeks after Jenna Bush made national headlines when she pleaded no contest to an earlier underage drinking charge. Did they believe no one in Austin would recognize them, or notice the Secret Service agents nearby?   The White House has described the incidents as private family matters. If the twins' mother, first lady Laura Bush, and grandmother, former first lady Barbara Bush, decide to apply a dose of old-fashioned tough love, it couldn't be any more painful than Thursday's front-page headline in the New York Post: ""Jenna and Tonic. Bush daughter in new booze incident as twin sister watched.""   For Chuy's, it's a different matter. Perhaps the restaurant management, with its Democratic ties, is privately reveling in the Republican first family's public embarrassment.   The restaurant did not return calls about its decision to publicize the incident.   But Thursday afternoon, the restaurant released a statement -- or more precisely, an understatement: ""We sincerely regret any inconvenience this has caused the first family.""

"A definition of patience.","

""It is the spirit which can bear things, not simply with resignation, but
with blazing hope; it is not the spirit which sits statically enduring in
the one place, but the spirit which bears things because it knows that these
things are leading to a goal of glory; it is not the patience which grimly
waits for the end, but the patience which radiantly hopes for the dawn.  It
has been called ""masculine constancy under trial.""  It has been said that
always it has a background witch is courage... It is the quality which keeps
a man on his feet with his face to the wind.  It is the virtue which can
transmute the hardest trial into glory because beyond the pain it sees the
goal.""  William Barclay

"MICHAEL BERRY campaign: 1) election night; 2) early vote party this Friday","
Election Night Returns Party: on election night, Nov 6,  starting at 7 and going late into the night, we'll be at This Is It Soul Food,  located just outside downtown.  Directions are available at the end of this  message, along with a review of the restaurant.  Please stop by.  The  evening will be very casual, and hopefully we'll have good  news.
 
Friday evening early vote: early voting ends this  Friday at 7 p.m.  We're meeting from 4 p.m. to about 8  p.m. this Friday, Nov 2, at La Griglia on West Gray just east of  Shepherd.  There will be a cash bar and appetizers.  It's very, very  casual.  We're encouraging everyone to VOTE EARLY before you stop by, and  bring as many friends or co-workers as possible.  You can vote at the West  Gray Multi-Service Center just down the street at 1475 W. Gray, between Waugh  and Shepherd, across from the Cafe Express.  Remember, regardless of where  you live, ANYONE can vote at that or ANY early vote site.  All you need is  your driver's license (in case you forget your registration card).  If  you're downtown, you may also choose to vote at 1301 Prairie, 16th  floor.
 
For both of these  events, your check made payable to the Michael Berry Campaign is welcome but not  required.  
 
PLEASE spread the  word. Please cut and paste this message to your list:

This Is It! is where it's at  for soul food 
By KATHI MOSBACHER
Houston Chronicle
Published: May 24,  1996
IN 1959, when Frank and Mattie Jones were  shown the little house at 1003 Andrews in the heart of the Fourth Ward, Mattie  knew the search was over. ""This is it!"" she said. 
They knocked down  walls, converted the garage into a kitchen and started a business that has  become an institution - This Is It!, ""soul food at its best,"" as it says on the  takeout menu. 
The couple remained at that location until 1983, when they  moved to 239 W. Gray. After 12 years there, Frank Jones' grandson, Craig Joseph,  and his wife, Georgette, moved the restaurant to its present location at 207 W.  Gray last spring. 
Mattie died last year, but 81-year-old Frank is still  cooking - from 5:30 in the evening until 10 the next morning -virtually the same  menu he has cooked for 37 years, with the assistance now of either Gladys  Jackson or Craig Joseph. 
Craig, a 36-year-old firefighter, says he and  his 35-year-old wife got involved in the restaurant because he couldn't bear to  see his grandparents' business sold to a stranger. 
When he's not  fighting fires - a job he says he still loves after 16 years and is able to do  because of his grandfather's presence at the restaurant - he joins Georgette at  This Is It! 
Georgette, who pretty much runs the show, also gets credit  for the new location's attractive decor and of course for her renowned peach  cobbler (she says they made B.B. King his own little cobbler when he was in town  recently to play at Rockefeller's). 
She firmly believes that ""we have  the best soul food in Houston. It's kind of rare to find a place where you can  get a plate of food without having to worry about adding more salt or pepper. .  . . It's just perfect."" 
""The secret to our success is how we season our  food,"" says Craig, whose grandfather takes seasoning so seriously that he  insists that he or Craig do it themselves. 
They're right. The food is  well-seasoned when it's meant to be seasoned - during the cooking process, not  at the table. This is homemade soul food to make any Southerner's heart sing. Go  helpless with hunger before making the trip; the portions are huge, and you'll  want to eat every bite. 
Georgette says most people ""say they'd prefer a  nap to going back to work"" after tucking in to three generous slabs of what may  be the best meat loaf in town (available Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays).  
Fresh chopped garlic brings out the flavor in the beef, Craig believes,  and the tomato sauce is especially good, although he prefers the creamy,  fall-off-the-bone-tender turkey wings (a special on Tuesdays, Thursdays and  Saturdays). 
Georgette's favorite dish is BBQ Rib Ends, meaty chunks of  pork with the brisket end of the rib barely attached to the bone, full of flavor  and cooked until they've absorbed the sweet-hot barbecue sauce. Fortunately this  dish is available every day, because it's terrific. 
But my favorite dish  is the one Craig believes made This Is It! - the oxtails, which Georgette says  she'd never even heard of before she met Craig. Actually they are sliced beef  tails browned, then braised to deeply delicious perfection with lots of chopped  onions, garlic, bell pepper and celery. 
""I guarantee that if I let you  try them, you're going to want oxtails! They're on the steam table in the same  place every day,"" Craig says. 
Frank Jones says the restaurant runs  through about 300 pounds of oxtails a day. ""When we opened in 1959, I used to  slice them myself and sold them for 89 cents a plate,"" he says. They're $6.50  now and come with a choice of three vegetables and heavenly corn-bread muffins.  
I recommend a heaping plate of the oxtails with their dense, rich brown  gravy spooned over white rice; cabbage, which is seasoned with small chunks of  smoky bacon and given more texture than usual by the addition of the darker,  coarser outer leaves; and maybe the green beans, cooked according to  well-founded Southern tradition, not al dente.
Of course, you could play  it safe and go with the buttery, golden-crusted baked chicken or the classic  pepper steak (Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays). 
Dessert is a must. Beyond  Georgette's peach cobbler is a selection of unimprovable lush, moist cakes, all  baked on the premises. 
This Is It! offers breakfast seven days a week,  the only meal not served cafeteria-style. Everything is cooked to order and  right on the mark, from the well-seasoned grits with a little pool of butter on  top to the pancakes. All eggs come with a choice of grilled pork chops, bacon,  two kinds of sausage or slices of sweet, baked ham. 
The restaurant may  also be the perfect source for fried turkey (available with 48 hours' notice).  My friends in Louisiana tell me that the tradition of frying turkeys began at  summer crawfish boils, rather than during the holidays, using the same equipment  for both tasks. I recommend ordering one for your next picnic or country outing.  
Prices: breakfast $3.50-$4.50, lunch and dinner (one entree, three  vegetables and corn bread) $6.50 Hours: breakfast 6:30 a.m.-10 a.m. daily; lunch  and dinner 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Mondays-Thursdays, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays,  and 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sundays.

"","Ken:

You would remember me as the deal team leader who lead the EES groundbreaking deal closure at Owens Corning, and subsequently, Eli Lilly and Owens Illinois.  

During these past weeks, while it has been difficult and you have had to deal with incredible adversity, you should know that the senior executives at these firms, including Charlie Golden at Lilly, have been very supportive of our both dilemma and the ideals we worked so hard to construct over the past few years.

I remain here, committed to assisting Dave Delainey as we re-configure for the future: however, sadly, it is likely that I will have to leave during or shortly after this transition period.  

Being a professional who focuses on bringing relationships to bear to create opportunities, I understand how important your referral to a couple of key senior executive recruiting principals would be.  I would be very appreciative of your consideration and referral, as it will greatly assist my personal transition over the next few months.

I would very much like the opportunity to shake your hand one last time before I leave.  I will check in with Rosalee Fleming and see if I can't ""gang-tackle"" you sometime in the near future.  

Even today I find myself staring up at the lobby photo of Harold Buchanan and I, and still getting charged up.  How much fun it has been to make a difference here!

Thank you very much,
Michael Mann
Vice President

IN THIS WEEK'S ISSUE:
1. The Regulatory Trap
2. World Freedom Index
3. Why Are the Public Schools Failing and What Can Be Done? -- Next
Independent Policy Forum (July 5, 2001)

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE REGULATORY TRAP

California's energy crisis is often portrayed as a failure of
deregulation. In reality, however, the restructuring of the Golden
State's power industry short-circuited rather than deregulated the
market process.

Legislation that squeezes all buyers and sellers into a short-term
spot market rather than lets them agree on the terms of their
contracts, imposes protectionist price floors that then become price
ceilings, and tilts the playing field against new suppliers and
distributors can be considered ""deregulation"" only in the sense that
Soviet-style economic planning can be considered ""economic.""

Had California taken deregulation seriously, it is likely that
electricity would be more plentiful and cheaper than before, as in
Pennsylvania, where deregulation, while still not 100 percent, is at
least worthy of the title.  But why didn't California legislators
attempt genuine deregulation? More broadly, why is deregulation so
seldom attempted anywhere, despite the fact the economists routinely
take pains to show how regulation is wasteful?

Economists often argue that resistance to deregulation stems mostly
from the fact that the benefits of deregulation are spread out among
potentially millions of people, while the benefits of regulation are
concentrated; the few who benefit find it easier to politick for
their cause.

While this is often a factor, there are several other reasons why
regulations become entrenched, according to economist Fred S.
McChesney. First, politicians assume that the public can live with
the status quo. Second, deregulation is likely to be entrusted to the
very politicians and bureaucrats who oversaw, and politically
benefited from, the existing regulatory regime. Third, regulation's
beneficiaries would expect to be paid off by the deregulation's
beneficiaries. Fourth, some of the costs of regulation are sunk,
e.g., spent on lobbying, and therefore can't be recovered by
deregulation. Fifth, the government may well confiscate the gains of
deregulation through taxes.

What McChensey explains is the existence for a stubborn regulatory
""lock-in,"" which unlike the urban myths of market lock-in (refuted in
Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis's persuasive book, WINNERS,
LOSERS AND MICRSOFT), does not go wanting for empirical examples.

""As many have noted, regulation is much easier to get than to get rid
of. The predictable path, once regulation has been adopted, is a
series of ratchets upward.""

Here McChesney relies on the notion of a ratchet effect (described in
detail in Independent Institute senior fellow Robert Higgs's book,
CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN): Each new government regulation or program
creates a new baseline from which it rarely if ever retreats.

This description of the regulatory state is apt, but let us suggest a
more vivid one. As in the old Roach Motel TV commercials, regulations
check in, but rarely check out. This metaphor at least has the
advantage of helping us keep in mind the sort of critters we are
dealing with.

INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Spring 1999), at

WORLD FREEDOM INDEX

According to the 2001 Index of Economic Freedom, only 12 countries,
representing 7 percent of the world's countries, can be considered
free. The report is overly optimistic, however; it overstates the
freedom and understates the repression in the freer countries,
according to Paul Craig Roberts, research fellow at The Independent
Institute, in a recent syndicated column.

""Hardly any of the index's 12 free countries are really free,"" writes
Roberts. ""For example, both the United States and Great Britain fall
in the 'repressed category' of the index with regard to tax burden,
as do Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Australia.""

The share of personal earnings collected as government taxes in the
index's freest countries often rivals the one-third taken from feudal
serfs by their lords or the fifty percent taken from 19th century
slaves by their masters.

""How can property rights be secure when taxation can claim a feudal
lord's or slave master's share of a citizen's working time?"" asks
Roberts.

Further, property rights are seldom fully secure even in the index's
highest-ranking countries. For example, ""U.S. property owners are at
grave risk of many federal, state and local laws that permit their
property to be seized on the slightest pretext. In 80 percent of
asset forfeitures, no charges are brought against the former owners.
To overlook this great insecurity of property in the United States is
to concoct a fanciful measure of property rights.""

What the index really shows, Roberts concludes, is that there are
virtually no free countries in the world.

See ""Freedom's Unheard Call"" by Paul Craig Roberts, at
http://www.townhall.com/columnists/paulcraigroberts/printpcr20010516.shtml.

WHY ARE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS FAILING AND WHAT CAN BE DONE? -- Next
Independent Policy Forum (July 5, 2001)

American children learn less than they did 30 years ago, and even
where there are signs of improvement, they are small. Many high
school graduates -- 90 percent of whom attended government-operated
public schools -- lack the skills needed in today's
knowledge-intensive workplace. Further, many students fail to
graduate. (The dropout rate in California is 32 percent overall, and
45 percent for immigrants.) Parents and educators have long
recognized the shortcomings of the public school system, but their
efforts to reform it have failed. Are school vouchers and charter
schools the answer? What about teacher-owned schools? What other
reforms might make schools more innovative and accountable to
parents? Please join us as education experts RICHARD VEDDER and JOHN
MERRIFIELD examine new strategies for achieving educational
excellence.

SPEAKERS:

   -- RICHARD VEDDER, Senior Fellow, The Independent Institute;
Professor of Economics, Ohio University; author, CAN TEACHERS OWN
THEIR OWN SCHOOLS?

   -- JOHN MERRIFIELD, Senior Research Associate; The Education Policy
Institute; Professor of Economics, University of Texas, San Antonio;
author, THE SCHOOL CHOICE WARS

WHEN:
        Thursday, July 5, 2001
        Reception and book signing: 6:30 p.m.
        Program: 7:00 - 8:30 p.m.

TICKETS: $30.00 per person: includes one copy of Richard Vedder's
book, CAN TEACHERS OWN THEIR OWN SCHOOLS?, OR John Merrifield's book,
THE SCHOOL CHOICE WARS, OR admission without a book is $10 per person
($7 for Independent Institute Associate Members)

Praise for Richard Vedder's book, CAN TEACHERS OWN THEIR OWN SCHOOLS?

""Vedder suggests for-profit schools owned and operated by teachers
and school administrators would offer a promising alternative to the
present public school system.""
   -- SCHOOL REFORM NEWS

""Nobody yet has found a foolproof formula for revitalizing American
K-12 education. So let's be humble enough -- and empirical enough --
to try as many tantalizing approaches as we can. In that spirit, I
commend Richard Vedder's pioneering ideas.""
   -- CHESTER E. FINN, JR., former Assistant Secretary, U.S.
Department of Education

For more information about CAN TEACHERS OWN THEIR OWN SCHOOLS?

Praise for John Merrifield's book, THE SCHOOL CHOICE WARS

""Professor Merrifield asks this question: what is meant by and what
is the intended consequence of reforms bearing such labels as
vouchers, school choice, charter schools, privatization, and
competition? This book brilliantly and clearly exposes the
superficiality and extraordinary fuzziness of those labels.""

"","Ken- I am a Director at EES and have been at Enron for 9 years. I am extremely proud of Enron and our many successes. The creativity and collective brainpower at Enron is unmatched in the industry. I attended the All Employee meeting you held before I left for vacation.  I left with a strengthened resolve and commitment to Enron. I thought a lot about your very effective handling of the issues in front of us. I am extremely disappointed in many of the prevailing negative attitudes internally and particularly some of the terribly disrespectful questions and comments thrown at you in the meeting. You as always handled the situation with grace, humor and poise. You have tremendous support internally despite what I perceive to be a relatively spoiled group of people who have no concept how good we all have it despite our current issues. I have total faith in our management team and am happy to see a very proactive offensive underway. Thank you for your commitment to Enron and know that many of us long term employees know from experience we will beat these challenges. The daily communication updates are forthright and honest and help people better understand what is going on. 

I hope you can disengage and find some enjoyment this weekend!

Dear Ken, 
The purpose of this message is to request a meeting with you at your convenience.  In light of my work in the past with Enron, I hope this request is not presumptuous on my part; certainly, my intent is to be helpful.  We met briefly five years ago when I was a director at McKinsey working with David Noble at Enron on leadership team and organization issues.  Dave introduced me to you because he felt that my experience was particularly relevant to several of the challenges you were facing.  However, we all concluded that it would be difficult for me to work with Jeff Skilling at that time because of his earlier junior/senior relationship with me at McKinsey.
Shortly after that discussion, I retired from McKinsey on very friendly terms to form my own firm.  Katzenbach Partners LLC specializes in organizational performance, leadership capability, and employee commitment issues.  We have a particularly distinctive competence in helping organizations use cultural and value-based elements to build ""peak performance"" across important segments or all of the employee base.  We believe we are unique in applying the intellectual creativity and analytical rigor of top strategy firms to these kinds of organizational and cultural challenges.  Our firm now has over fifty highly qualified professionals, and we serve a range of leading and successful companies on these issues.
Based on my previous recollections of some of the people challenges facing Enron and the leadership transition you are likely undergoing, I feel that Katzenbach Partners could be particularly useful to you and your organization right now.  Since leaving McKinsey, I have continued to conduct extensive research in the areas of leadership, cultural change, and employee motivation.  In addition, my firm has significant experience with leading companies helping them organize to establish new values and change cultural behavior to improve enterprise performance.
Based upon our limited current exposure to Enron, the recent number of leadership changes appear very likely to create cultural issues and gaps that may warrant new, creative approaches to realign behaviors and commitment within the company.  If you find these kinds of issues relevant and timely, I would be very interested in meeting to discuss and trade current perspectives.  I will ask my colleague in Houston, Kenny Kurtzman, to call to see if it would be appropriate for us to get together.
Sincerely, 
Jon R. Katzenbach

"RE: Special Radko Ornament","Dear Joannie,

The ornament is fantastic and very appropriate this year.  We will need to
get an exact head count for the Enron order.  The corporate secretary
usually gives me an exact directors list and then Ken is the one that
decides which of his executives are invited to the dinner and Rosie provides
me with a list.

Additionally, I would like 15 ornaments for my personal use that I would
like to get ordered ASAP.  Is your source giving you a discount and if so,
how much?  I have several sources for getting discounts on most items,
including Radko ornaments, that I use every year.  Let's compare prices.

I had a vendor send this to me.  It is a special Radko ornament he
designed in remembrance of the recent disasters in NY and Washington.
The proceeds from the sell of this are going to the relief efforts.  I
thought it might be of interest to you as a possible holiday gift.  The
cost is around $30.  The problem is, we would need to reserve some by
this Friday.  I'm happy to coordinate one consolidated order if this is
of interest.  Please get back to me ASAP and let me know.  Thanks.

A t t e n t i o n :
This is very scary and is not a joke. Please  read - it definitely is a
serious threat to our lives and health. This is  an alert about a virus
in the original sense of the word...... one that  affects
your body.....not your hard drive. There have been  23
confirmed cases of people attacked by the Klingerman Virus,
a virus  that arrives in your real mailbox, not
in your e-mail inbox. Someone has  been mailing large blue
envelopes, seemingly at random, to people in the  U.S. and Canada.
On the front of the envelope in bold black
letters is  printed "" A Gift For You From The Klingerman Foundation"".
When  the envelopes are opened, there is a small sponge sealed
in plastic. This  sponge carries what has come to be known as the
and public health  officials state this is a strain of virus
they have not previously  encountered. Those who have come in contact
with the Klingerman Virus  have been hospitalized with severe dysentery. So
far
seven of the  twenty-three victims have died. There is no legimitate
Klingerman  Foundation, mailing unsolicited gifts. If you receive an
oversized blue  envelope in the mail marked ""A Gift For You From The
Klingerman  Foundation"". Do not open it !!!!! Place it in a strong
plastic bag  or container & call the police immediately. The ""gift""  is
one you defiinitely do not want to open.

"Concern about EBS","Mr. Lay,

Recent developments with EBS are causing me significant concern. I became employed by Enron (EBS) as part of the acquisition of DataSystems Group, Inc. in 1999. Part of that employment agreement included a retention bonus, payable in three installments in March of 2000, 2001, and 2002. We were told that bonus was payable if we did not voluntarily terminate (quit) prior to those dates.

With the highly uncertain future of EBS, I am faced with two likely scenarios:

Scenario 1 - EBS terminates as part of a severance prior to February of 2002.
I receive no bonus for 2001 after working countless hours of overtime to ""save EBS"".
I receive no retention payment because I was severed prior to March 31.

Scenario 2 - Enron divests EBS to a third party.
Third party terminates employment with little or no severance.
I receive no bonus for 2001 after working countless hours of overtime to ""save EBS"".
I receive no retention payment because I was severed prior to March 31.


As my wife and I both work for EBS, this is an even greater concern to me. 

At the recent all-employee meeting, you asked everyone to redouble their work, work harder and more than before to help pull Enron out of this current crisis. I find it difficult (as do those working for me) to commit to this effort while we're facing what appears to be almost certain personal disaster. We have been working tirelessly on the Microsoft deal since the beginning of the year. It now is beginning to look like we'll see no acknowledgement from Enron for the work.

I would like to know what you and Enron can do to assuage the concerns my reports and I have over these issues.

Thank you,

Tim

I can't begin to tell you how much I admire you. I still trust you, I still believe in you, I still think you are making the right decisions for the future of this company.
 
Do you know why?
 
Because I absolutely love the Enron that you built.  Enron believed in me.  Enron took a chance on me.  Enron made me into what I am today.  I'm a single mom that started in the back office, worked her way up onto the Weather Derivatives Desk and finally onto the Natural Gas Trading Floor in Energy Risk Management.  Where else could anyone get these sort of opportunities? NO-WHERE.

Please reconsider and take our lumps like Columbia Gas System, like Continental Airlines and get back into solvency the best way we know how to.  The past is past, lets pick up ourselves by our boot straps and get back into the fight and win this one.

You know that you can count on me and the rest of my team in ETS to stand by this decision to stand and fight.

Ever Loyal and willing to serve.

Rudy Elizondo (ETS).

ps If you need more inspirational speeches from me, I will be happy to oblige.

"Option Expiration","Mr. Lay-

I am a long-term Enron employee and have shared your vision of building Enron for over 10 years.  It has been exciting being a part of building the World's Largest Energy Company.   I am concerned about the short term turn of events at Enron but still feel loyal and committed to Enron and your vision.   Unfortunately, my passion to follow your vision has led me to keep the many stock options I have accumulated over the years instead of ""cashing out"".   I am now faced with options that not only are ""under water"" but also some will expire as soon as January 2002.  I know it is not possible to reset the option price.  However, is it possible to extend the option expiration date on these options a few years?  I believe Enron will eventually rebound and I still believe in your vision but I also believe it will be a while before we can recapture the confidence of the markets. 

Thanks and keep the faith.

"","Ken/Greg:

The water cooler talk is focused around two areas:  potential bankruptcy and liquidity concerns; and massive layoffs (30% or so).  

Clearly, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs dictates that tomorrow's meeting address:
Personal issues:
-	Commitment and ability to pay salary and bonuses
-	Potential layoffs
Company-related issues
-	Risk of Enron bankruptcy
-	Sources and uses of liquidity;

I believe I know the answers to all of the above but these are the issues upon which the 'average' employee is focused.

"Calif.'s Energy Future","Dear Ken,

I hope you 'visit' with the Governor was as fruitful as mine.  we are
very favorably supported in our development of a Regional Energy
Efficiency Initiative ... an approach to defining and delivering
sustainable energy efficiency. (not conservation!)

There is an opportunity to discuss a way in which Enron could perhaps
become involved in a very significant set of new developments within the
sphere of influence in which I operate.  If you wish to 'look into' this
.. let me know.  I believe such an endeavor during this difficult time
might well stand you in good stead .. and its a way to enter the end use
services business.

I look forward to getting to Aspen  for the AI conference.

I have asked both Ben Smith and Dan Leff to confirm
that these expenses will be paid so I can close the
office in Nevada.  It is a small amount but I can not
cover the cost for Enron out of my personal funds.
The total outstanding is $3,443.04.  Can you please
see that this gets paid ASAP.
Thanks and God Bless,
Chuck Allured

Ben, Leticia,
I hope this is not the last time we get to work
together.  As we discussed, I will have some office
closure expenses that I will need to get reimbursed
for.  I have been locked out of the server so I can
not enter them into the xms system.
This amounts to the following:

ATT wireless:
$212.71 November Billing
$90 Termination charge

Nevada Bell:
$170 November billing (est.)
$500 DSL Setup fee (November)
$49.95 November DSL monthly fee
$250 Termination Charge of one year contract

--------
$1,272.66 Total

Can you please process this and get $ to me asap so I
can disconnect all of the services?  You can reach me
at (775)832-2141 or cra123@yahoo.com

Thanks for all of the memories and may God bless us
all.
Chuck

"Its not Denial...","
Comments about AEI conf on Oct 22,  2001.
 
I am NOT AFRAID nor in ""Denial.""
 
I know this ""War"" is fake and that the intel  community allowed this attack, cultivated ""IT"" like a bitter fruit.
 
Do you really have no sence of  history?
 
The Anthrax comes from BioPort labs, its intention  is to stifle any decent in the ""Liberal Elite.""
 
 
War on Terror is not the endgame  anyway.
 
This is: www.disclosureproject.org 
 
Be Ready.
 
 
After this dictatorship is overthrown You will be  accountable for your actions at this time.
 
You personaly, I will make sure of it.
 
However,
 
You Can help if you want to and can find the  strength, 
 
YOU can do something about this, ur  elite.
 
So PLEASE just try  and stop it.
 
Are you SO Comfortable that you have no ethics  anymore?
 
 
Are you really now planning on killing  everyone in Congress? 
 
I thought they would play-ball after the Anthrax  ""Scare.""
 
I remember pri conf on ""Lets Admit That  PaxAmericana is an Empire.""
 
You all are so prophetic. 
 
You won't get away with it in the long run, but SO  MANY people are going to get hurt in the process of over-throwing the elite  class.
 
 
Btw, I am a descendant of George Washington's Bro,  so this is coming from a member of a founding family, you should think about  that.
 
Or just snort more Prozac, shrug.
 
 
I am a dedicated Buddhist so I am not able to join  the Elite and act on this.
 
We need your help.
 
Please help.
 
 
Ok, remember, I asked.
 
 
Best Regards,

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Enron Book Project","
 
Dear Ken:
 
When the timing is right, I would like to visit  with you (and Linda if appropriate) to discuss my idea of writing a scholarly  but lively history of Enron.  My working title is Ambition: The Rise and  Fall of Enron.  Perhaps the ""Fall"" is premature, but it will be revised  accordingly if a stunning comeback is achieved.  One of the advantages of a  longer book is that the last chapter will be on industry developments a year or  two out to see there things really land with or without Enron.
 
What I have in mind is a two-year research and  writing project--or longer.  It would develop your history through  Transco and then begin when John Duncan recruited you to Enron.  The  history, unlike the books we are likely to see in the next year,  would fully develop a number of energy, political economy, and corporate  culture themes.  I will, of course, bring in all the recent and  forthcoming events as the climax, but the buildup is what will distinguish  the book.  I anticipate it would be akin to ""The Prize,"" but instead of the  ""epic quest for oil, money, and power"" the Enron story would be the ""epic""  or ""fatal"" quest to create the world's leading company.
 
This is a book for history.  The operative  word is understanding.  The book is not intended to preserve Enron's  legacy or your legacy per se but to teach the world about what happened and  why.  There will be many positives in the story but there will be  negatives--maybe a lot of negatives.  I will be happy to discuss some  of my hypotheses of the negatives and sensitivities with you up  front.  I truly believe that a totally candid analysis of the situation is  the best legacy that Enron or you can bequeath to the business and public policy  world.  Personally for all of us who have been hurt, it is the best  foundation to move forward and once again hang our heads high.  The past  cannot be undone.  (And interestingly, there is a remarkable historical  precedent for what happened to Enron and you in the energy-centered story  of Samuel Insull--so you have pretty good company.)
 
I heard through the grapevine that you are thinking  of writing your own book.  That is a good idea for several reasons.   But I want to discuss what my book would be about in the hopes that I can  interview you over the course of the research and writing.  If  so, your autobiography could come after my book where you face up  to all the tough questions and have the ""last say.""  You would also  have a secure foundation from my book with all your  accomplishments.
 
I have about a month to finish a detailed  outline of the book and produce some writing samples.  An agent will shop  the proposal around, and we will see if the advance is enough to proceed.   (I got fairly wiped out by the crash.)  I am also investigating having  a co-author involved on the ""Fall"" side, while I work on the ""Rise""  side.  I also might get some foundations or investors involved to make the  economics work, and the early indication is that there will be support.  A  lot of people would be very supportive of a full history rather than what  we are likely to see in the next year.
 
I have a PowerPoint presentation on the potential  book and will be happy to visit with you.  It might be better to visit at  the Huntington, but the office is fine also.  My home and work phone is  713-266-3934.
 
Best wishes,
 
- Rob

"Calif energy panle/ new energy policy for US","Ken,

We met when you were up at Sun Microsystems meeting with Scott and several
CEOs. I talked with you during and after the event. I'm still working with
the Governor's office to try to put in place a responsible panel for
evaluating Calif energy policy. Its very frustrating dealing with these
guys...with the lone exception of Freeman in the Governor's office who has
been the most supportive, reasonable, and responsive of all the folks I've
talked with.

I met with Senators Bingaman and Reid last night and discussed with them
accelerating the move from a fossil-fuel economy to a renewable/hydrogen
powered economy.

I, along with many experts in alternative energy, believe the time is now to
start the transition. Reid has been a long-time hydrogen proponent, and
Bingaman was surprised on how economically it can be done to convert. In
addition, Gephardt is already very supportive of this move, as I'm sure
Daschle will be as well (I had dinner with Daschle last night, but we didn't
discuss this issue, but I will when I meet with him again in DC next week).

There's no question that it's the right move for the country. But it's the
antithesis of the current Bush energy plan.

Will you join with me in supporting making this happen? If so, I will call
you to discuss next steps in formulating a responsible energy policy for
America.

P.S. You may find the attached letter from NRDC president to Secretary
Whitman of interest.

Subject:	Request For Assistance

Mr. Lay:

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping to strengthen a relationship EES has with Sysco Corporation.  

EES and Sysco began discussing a wide array of business opportunities with one another in the Fall of last year. On June 30th of this year, we entered into a 10 year electricity supply contract for all of Sysco's California facilities.  We are currently pursuing two important Q4 transactions with Sysco; an electricity supply contract for their Texas facilities and a demand side management contract for all of their facilities.

We had planned to close the Texas supply transaction today.  However, in a phone conversation I had this morning with Sysco's Director of Procurement, Terry Taylor I was informed that Sysco's CEO, Charles Cotros has instructed Mr. Taylor not to enter into any further transactions with us ""until Enron's financial picture clears up"".  Mr. Taylor believes that Mr. Cotros' concerns about Enron would be diminished if he received a call from a senior executive at Enron. 

Rosalee indicated that you and Mr. Cotros serve together on the Board of Directors for the Greater Houston Partnership. Would you please call Mr. Cotros and attempt to assuage his concerns about our financial condition.  Mr. Cotros is out of the office until Thursday, November 1st.  His direct phone number is (281) 584-1415.  His assistant is Andrea Walters and her phone number is (281) 584-1405.   Mr. Cotros' biography is as follows:   

Charles H. Cotros, age 64, has served as a director of SYSCO since 1985.  Mr. Cotros has served as Chairman of the Board since July 2000 and as Chief Executive Officer since January 2000.  He served as Chief Operating Officer from 1995 until January 2000 and as President from 1999 until July 2000.  He has been employed by SYSCO since 1974.  Mr. Cotros is Chairman of the Executive Committee and he is also a member of the Finance Committee.   Source: Proxy, 9/24/01

Thank you in advance for your consideration and anticipated assistance.  Otherwise, please let me know if you will not be able take the action requested and I will initiate an alternative plan.

Respectfully,

Craig Sutter

"Ethanol Plant Project","Ken, we are working with a team that is building ethanol plants throughout
the Southeast and the Midwest, and we are in the process of arranging the
right capital partner as well as identifying the right strategic partner for
that endeavor. The other players in this ambitious project have
relationships into Enron, but I thought that you might be able to shove me
in the right direction of the person to talk to there.

I hope all is well with you, and one day when you are in the DC area and
have nothing better to do you will let me have the opportunity to visit over
dinner and reflect on how many years it has been since you and we created
the Natural Gas Clearing House. We are having a lot of fun putting together
large private equity deals and you might find that aspect of what we do as
possibly interesting as well. We have expanded into the energy and utilities
space as telecomm and technology have had their share of problems. In any
event, would appreciate the input and look forward to a visit in the not too
distant future. Best regards, Tom

"Leaving California Residential Market","
Dear Mr. Lay,
 
Recently I received notice that Enron will no  longer provide electric service for my residence ""as a result of continued  uncertainty in this market, as well as a lack of clarity on the future of direct  access."" I find this very disappointing and would like Enron to re-consider  this decision.
 
I am a strong believer in the free market system  and, in part, it was for this reason that I chose Enron as my electric  service provider several years ago when the market in California was  deregulated. I also chose Enron because of my knowledge of your company,  its leadership and the strategic direction you have provided.
 
Never was there a time in the marketing  of electric service to the State of California for a company such as  Enron to exhibit long range thinking & leadership. This is an opportunity  for Enron to show commitment and staying power in a market  that has ""radically changed"" and lacking in clarity.
 
I recognize it is not an easy decision to change a  decision that has already been made. However, I also consider you a risk  taking, strong and capable leader who wants to make the right decision for  its ultimate customers in spite of  short term political decisions (that  will get changed) by Governor Davis.
 
Sincerely,

years i have worked at

the outlandish executive bonuses and money to the

prison for the fraud you have committed. The few
shares

  When you opted to replace the oracle Payroll with

all the great people that made you now have to find a

Wolf Blitzer Reports: 5:00 & 7:00 p.m. EST
Tuesday January 8, 2002
=================================================
The Value of a Life
=================================================
From CNN's Wolf Blitzer in Washington:

Despite his Democratic Party credentials, it was not a huge
surprise that President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft
appointed Ken Feinberg to take charge of one of the most
important and sensitive jobs in Washington. In late November,
Feinberg was tapped to distribute the billions of federal dollars
allocated to the families of those killed in the September 11
terrorist attacks. Feinberg is now the so-called Special Master
of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund.

Just click here http://www.cnn.com/wolf to read my column
for more on Feinberg's tough job of assessing the value of
the lives lost in the September 11th attacks.

Today, on both editions of Wolf Blitzer Reports, we will take
look at the latest developments in the war against terrorism.
On our 5 PM (Eastern) program, I will speak with former Clinton
deputy national security adviser James Steinberg and former
Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Karl Inderfurth.
I will also have a special interview with Democratic Senator
Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who worked closely with
the president in getting the new education bill passed.

On our 7 PM War Room program, we will examine how
vulnerable the U.S. remains to terrorist strikes. Among my
guests: Gen. Wesley Clark; Los Angeles Times reporter Robin
Wright; and Republican Congressman Saxby Chambliss, who
chairs the homeland security subcommittee.

Please join us tonight and every weeknight at 5 & 7 PM (EST).
Don't forget to answer my question of the day: With al Qaeda on
the run, how vulnerable do you feel? Just go to my website
http://www.cnn.com/wolf to let us know what you think.

Thanks.

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"PW - Line of Credit","
Mark, David Robyn & Liz,
 
If you need cash, but don't want to sell stock or options, I have a  possible solution.  I am currently waiting for approval for a Line of  Credit (LOC) at PaineWebber.  I don't know how much each of you has  there, but I have all of my assets (stocks) held there, which includes managed  accounts (i.e., Cypress Asset & TCW).  If you need funds for something,  such as a private investment, a new car or to pay down some other  more costly debt, then you can draw on this LOC up to 65% the value of the  collateral.  The terms of the LOC does not allow for the purchase public  equities (stocks).  I will say that we are getting the ""family special"" on  this, because this would typically only be offered to clients that had tens of  millions with PaineWebber.
 
The LOC terms are the following:
(1)  Must have combined assets > $550,000 held at  Painewebber (must be marketable securities, excludes PaineWebber alternative  investments)
(2)  Rate is 30 day-LIBOR plus 45 basis points (same rate  for KLL/LPL)
(3)  65% LTV
 
Alternatively, you can borrow on your margin account there if you already  have one.  However, the LTV is only 50%.
 
I notified Ann Bennett (PaineWebber) today that this might be of  interest for some of you.  You can call her directly at 713-957-7042 to set  this up.  I would be happy to discuss this further with any of you.

Tepco Chief Braces For Lower Power Demand From Ind Users


TOKYO (Nikkei)--Terrorist attacks and the subsequent fall in U.S. stock
prices have diminished the confidence of Japanese businesses and
investors, who were already reeling from a global slowdown.

In an interview with The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Nobuya Minami, president
of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501), said he is prepared to see power
demand from large-lot users weakening amid the slumping economy.
Excerpts follow:

Q: How do you view the stock price plunge that has occurred in the
aftermath of terrorist attacks in the U.S.?

A: Japanese stock prices were falling before the attacks, suggesting
that prices may have been inflated to begin with. I think stock prices
may fall further because it's inevitable that companies will collapse as
financial institutions expedite disposal of bad loans.

Q: What's your outlook on the economy and demand for electricity?

A: It's still too early to assess the true economic impact of the
terrorist attacks, but it will be a considerable blow to the sluggish
Japanese economy. The so-called ""hollowing out"" of the Japanese
manufacturing industry is likely to gather speed as more producers
transfer their factories to China and other Asian countries.

Consumption of electricity was high this summer, but volume customers
are using less because industrial activities continue to slump. I expect
consumption among volume users will begin rising once the bad debt
liquidation phase has passed.

Q: Do you have concerns about rising oil prices given the situation in
the Middle East.

A: Japan depends less on oil now than we did in the 1970s, when there
was a major oil crisis. Our energy sources are more diverse and our oil
reserve system is in good shape. There may be price hikes, but the
impact will be much smaller this time.

Q: Will Tokyo Electric reduce capital investment further?

A: We decided last spring to keep our annual capital investment under
900 billion yen on average for the next three years. That's about 40%
lower than our capital spending during peak times. We'll make further
adjustments if necessary when we create a new capital investment plan
next spring.

Q: While most companies are struggling, Tokyo Electric is expected to
post its highest group net profit since it began reporting group
earnings in fiscal 1994. There are increasing calls to lower electricity
charges, aren't there?

A: We plan to lower the charges in the medium to long term.

Q: What do you say to the view that demand for electricity is unlikely
to rise in the long term, given rising environmental awareness among
Japanese consumers?

A: I think an increasing number of environmentally conscious people will
cut consumption as they pursue a life that's less driven by consumption.
Electric companies have to develop new revenue sources, such as energy
conservation consulting.

Q: In the U.S. and Europe, many utility companies handle both
electricity and gas. Do you think Japanese electric companies will do
the same?

A: As deregulation advances, the boundaries between electricity, gas and
oil industries in Japan will probably become more blurred. Tokyo
Electric has to become a more comprehensive company that can deliver
whatever energy the market demands.

Power deregulation fails to connect
New entrants impeded by high up-front costs; some foreign firms prefer
trading or other niches

NATSUKO SEGAWA
Staff writer



Ennet Corp., an independent power provider established by the NTT group
and others, operates this power plant, which started up in July, in
Ibaraki Prefecture.


Some 18 months after the partial deregulation of the electricity market,
new entrants are beginning to wonder if they really are facing free and
fair competition for the potentially huge profits. Meanwhile, some
foreign firms are utilizing their advantages, such as expertise in
power-related financial trading, to carve out new niches unexplored by
Japan's tradition-bound regional power utilities.

Since March 2000, when the government revised the Electricity Utilities
Industry Law to allow free entry to the retail market for large-lot
users, nine domestic companies have notified the Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry of their plans to enter the market. While not yet
submitting such notifications, at least three foreign firms - Enron
Japan Corp., InterGen (HK) Ltd. and El Paso Japan Co. - have started
feasibility studies or negotiations with potential clients.

In spite of the sluggish economy, the utility business appeared to be a
promising field because of its huge potential: Full-scale deregulation
will give access to a market worth around 15 trillion yen ($127 billion)
a year, making Japan the world's second-largest electricity market.
Further, the market keeps growing at a rate of 1-2% a year. So even when
just 30% of the market was opened, there was a rush of new entrants.

But their expectations have been largely disappointed. According to an
estimate by the Trade Ministry, new entrants have only a 0.2% share of
the market. The difficulty in constructing new power plants, high
transmission costs and an uncertain deregulation schedule are slowing
new participants' expansion of business.

Enron, which opened a Tokyo office in July last year, is mounting an
active challenge to Japan's regulations and traditional business
customs. In May, its local unit released proposals on electricity reform
via the Internet, which say that if the Japanese electricity market had
introduced fair competition and reduced electricity costs to the level
of the U.S., large-lot customers could have cut their electricity costs
by around 4 trillion yen a year.

Nicholas O'Day, vice president of Enron Japan, does not try to hide his
irritation at the slow progress of the deregulation process and
indicates that strong government leadership is needed to enforce further
reform. Especially, Enron and other new entrants want to see sharp
reductions in the transmission fees charged to independent power
providers by the utilities for access to their transmission lines.

Satoshi Abe, senior analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research, said: ""Most
clients in the deregulated market are industrial customers that already
enjoy low electricity costs amounting to 12 yen per kilowatt-hour. The
average generating cost is 7 yen per kilowatt-hour, and new entrants pay
around 4-5 yen per kilowatt-hour to utilities in transmission charges
and other fees. So there's no room for profit.""

However, Hiroshi Araki, manager of corporate planning at Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (Tepco), argued, ""We face the same cost when we use our own
transmission lines, so we're competing on an equal footing with the new
entrants.""

Another disappointment for the new suppliers was the difficulty of
obtaining additional electricity to sell. As building a power plant
requires an initial investment of at least 10 billion yen, most new
entrants planned to buy excess electricity from manufacturers who have
their own power generators and resell it.

But the plan soon ran into difficulties. ""We could procure only 50-60%
of the electricity we needed, and we were forced to revise our business
model,"" said Tsutomu Takeda, vice president of Ennet Corp., an
independent power provider set up by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. group and others. To secure supplies for its main customer, the
NTT group, Ennet started operating a power plant in Ibaraki Prefecture
in July and plans three more in Chiba and Kyoto prefectures by autumn
2003.

For the foreign entrants, the situation is even more severe as they have
to build relationships with customers and find suitable sites to build
power plants from scratch. Earlier this year, two U.S. power companies,
El Paso and InterGen, opened branches in Tokyo, but they say they are
just waiting and watching developments for now.

Stephen Del Regno, president of El Paso Japan, compared the situation
here to that of South Korea, which is also deregulating. ""In South
Korea, land and labor costs are also very high, but it is still more
than 50% cheaper to build a power plant there.""

Keys Curry, head representative at InterGen, said: ""The environmental
impact assessment process is quite long in Japan. So if you want to
build a large power plant, it takes at least six years. Who can propose
to clients to buy electricity that will be provided six years later?""

Financial products

Seeing these difficulties, some foreign companies chose to start by
offering financial products hedging risk, and follow by trading
electricity or futures contracts. Enron is the forerunner in the field,
offering weather derivatives and other such products. The local unit of
a major U.S. brokerage has staged experimental futures trading of
electricity, gathering around 20 participants in March and May. Both
have power plants in the U.S., but here they are leaving actual
generation until later.

"(no subject)","Mr. Lay, I have always admired the company YOU created and the corporate culture you created.

As the CFO of a public company I understand, at least somewhat, of the struggles involved in being a public company.

I certainly empathize with you during this tough time. Unfortunately people expect you to be perfect. It's also easy for people outside of Enron to throw stones. A lot of them are jealous outsiders that have been waiting for this for a long time.

Don't let them win, prove to them the power and strength of Enron and have the last laugh. Regards, and I'll be laughing with you.

"Press Release-IntraTel -- Unlimited Long Distance Phone Calls","
Hi  Kenneth,
We are within a year anniversary attempt to arrange a meeting with you and
our CEO  Jack Nester in order to present Telecompression, and how we can cut
""Enron Corp."" by hundreds of millions off Long Distance phone bill.
The second part of this email is to show how we are advancing toward this
""Goal"" and asking to allow us this meeting or a conference call with you.

Telecompression Technologies  announces  IntraTel,  groundbreaking new 40-1
Telecompression software that dramatically reduces intra-office
long-distance phone bills.
IntraTel, a revolutionary new 40-to-1 voice compression software solution
that could shave millions of dollars off corporate long-distance telephone
bills, has just been announced by Telecompression Technologies, Inc. (TTI)
California.
IntraTel, converts a company's LAN, WAN, intranet or VPN into the most
advanced telephony communications system ever available. ""For large
corporations with multiple offices, campuses, including offices abroad,
""this is the communications technology breakthrough everyone's been waiting
for. It's easily the most significant cost-savings telecommunications tool
of the past 50 years.""

IntraTel, is unique because of its dynamic bandwidth allocation and an
unparalleled capacity of providing toll quality voice with up to 40-to-1
voice compression. It outpaces standard code compressions that can, at best,
deliver voice at an 8-to-1 compression. This makes possible a level of
compression, which TTI has trademarked as Telecompression, applicable across
corporate enterprise networks regardless of bandwidth.  ""we can do all of
this without sacrificing voice quality.""

IntraTel, which quickly installs on a Windows 2000 network, allows companies
to immediately realize savings of thousands of dollars every month for calls
to dispersed company facilities and their surrounding area codes.  ""For very
large corporations with staffs and facilities all over the world, savings
could easily run into the millions of dollars every year.""

IntraTel replaces a company's standard telephone communications with
network-based PCs on any type of digital network. The company installs the
IntraTel Server software on one or more network domain controllers or
dedicated Windows 2000 workstations, and individual users can easily
download the IntraTel Client software from the network. This gives each
intra-company PC user, regardless of his or her global location, access to
the program's unique cost-saving benefits and features.

The program makes possible extremely high-quality PC-to-PC, PC-to-phone and
phone-to-PC connections. It supports 10baseT, 100baseT, and 1000baseT, as
well as optical-based networks. PBX features are included to facilitate user
transition from conventional Telco-type systems to network-based telephony
operations. IntraTel can support up to 65,000 users over a wide area
intranet or VPN comprised of either copper, fiber, satellite, wireless or
combined system.

Other features include phone conferencing for up to eight individuals in
multiple locations, whiteboard chat, optional voice mail lobby, text chat,
file transfer and save-to-file, and more.
Among the many options are IntraTel Phone Jump, which lets any user dial any
phone number in an area code in which the company has both an IntraTel
Access Server and a connected employee/user. In other words, if your San
Francisco office has an employee in London with the IntraTel server and PC
software in place, you could call any other phone number in that London area
code without paying long-distance phone charges.

The new IntraTel Encryption option. This solution gives businesses low-cost
capabilities for protecting their worldwide telecommunications. IntraTel
Encryption provides the highest level of secure voice, text and data
transfer with channel-by-channel encryption. Each company receives and
manages its own custom key store, giving it maximum security for sensitive
communications.""

who talk to Mr., Lay and Mr. Whalley, I assumed that you knew the connection
between Dirad Inc. ( called as of July 2001  Telecompression Technology Inc.
TTI ), StealthSoft, and e-Business.


On October 2000 Dirad Inc. Willie Williams spoke to Mr. Lay , and Mr.
Whalley, Willie was referred to Bob Justice and Ted Sietz few days later we
had signed an NDA with Enron in order to conduct a meeting between Dirad
technical scientists. Mr. Cecil Motley and  Mr. Ted Sietz VP Enron
Broadband.
Two months later we had a meeting with Ted Sietz, Rob Justice, and a few
other gentleman from Enron at our offices in California. At that time our
patent technology was early on in the development stage.
( If you like I can fax you this NDA )

As a prodigy development organization Dirad  change their name to
Telecompresion Technology Inc. to refract the new ""Netch"" we created in the
telecommunication industry.
Since the market is extremely ""Hot"", and we are experiencing 420K potential
"" Sits""  currently testing our Beta technology. We fill it is the time to
take action.
TTI  has a valid business propositions and we can present it to Enron Corp.
at your convenience . Our CEO would like to meet Mr. Ken Lay to introduce
the hole concept to Enron Corp. and alleviating your trading partner MCI,
and maybe Qwest Commu. if they aren't out of the picture already.

Around mid July 2001, I spoke to Rick Causey about our mature developed
technology, and send and email to him introducing TTI. When I called back
his assistant Sharon Westford, referred me to George Wasaff who referred me
to Peter Goebel,
I sent an email to Peter Goebel at the end of August ,and showed him the
info on Telecompression web site. Peter asked Hasan Imam to call me.

"Rice University - Markets in Transition Symposium:  January 10, 2002","Dear Dr. Lay,

We are looking forward to your participation at the upcoming ""Markets
in Transition"" symposium at Rice University on January 10, 2002.

Invitations to the event were sent approximately two weeks ago.  The
invitations listed the agenda and speakers.  We have completed
incorporating the biography and photograph that you provided into the
program brochure.

During the event, we have allocated 20 minutes, beginning at 1:40PM,
for your remarks on Markets in Transition.  We expect your remarks to
be broad in scope and to provide your views on how the economic and
market factors of recession, technology evolution, and heightened
security are impacting the business landscape.  Our hope is that your
remarks will be generic in nature -- Markets in Transition is a
concept that applies to virtually all industries.

We understand that you will make no reference to Enron.  Furthermore,
there will be no question and answer session after your presentation.
We will take measures to ensure that the press has no access to you
before or after your remarks.

Please return the speaker logistics form (requested separately) at
your earliest convenience.

We look forward to your participation.  Please contact me or Brad
Burke, Associate Director of the Rice Alliance (713-348-6136), if you
wish additional information.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

"cost cutting measures - from an Employee/shareholder point of view","Dear All,
The business units are operating on a lean G&A budget and cut costs whenever we can and making sure that we are efficient.  Are there any initiative to do likewise for all corp functions?  As an accountant in the business unit, we received corp allocations.  The total for corp was more than $700MM.  This, of course, excludes Enron Net Work, Enron Property, and Global Finance, which if we include those, the G&A to Enron could well be over $1Billion (not counting the business units G&A).  

The number just blew me away.  I think we need to make sure all functions are needed and are run efficiently.  We cannot say it's OK just because we can allocate to the business units because the business units may not receive benefits for these costs.   We sure don't want Enron, as a whole, to be growing so fat and so fast that it will hurt our bottom line.  I'm sorry if I'm out of line, but I really do care about Enron and am very proud to be its employee.

Subject:	Status CEG/CEG-Rio Transaction

Current state of play:

ASEP took the transaction off of their agenda for their October 25 meeting.  Reason was that some directors complained that the required 10 day public notice of the meeting was not given in time.

Head of ASEP has committed to Petrobras (as well as to Orlando Puppin) that the transaction will be on the agenda for a November 14 meeting and should be approved that day.  Petrobras is getting this commitment in writing and will forward to us.

The approval process is that ASEP sends a letter supporting approval to Vagner Victor.  Vagner Victor sends a letter to the Governor requesting that he issue a directive.

Petrobras has said that if they get the letters form ASEP and Vagner Victor then they will waive having to wait on the Governor issuing the directive as a condition to close.

Petrobras has assurances from ASEP and Vagner Victor that they will provide the recommendation letters soon after the November 14 meeting.

 Petrobras wants to target Monday November 19 for pre-closing and November 20 for closing in Houston.

On Monday, Richard Olm secured the approval of the Brasoil board for the transaction -- final internal approval required.

Petrobras has instructed their lawyers to meet with our lawyers next week to finalize the closing documents.

Petrobras has assured me that the money is ready offshore to complete the deal.  Petrobras has been working with us and Bank of America to set up the accounts they will need to complete the subsequent transactions.

Petrobras has their accountants in our Rio office this week to make sure they have all the documents necessary for completing the deal.

Petrobras knows that there are issues in CEG (concerning gas supply and tariffs) that are scheduled for the November CEG board meeting that they would vote yes on but that Enron would veto.  We will probably delay that vote but Petrobras realizes that a decision must be made soon in order not to affect the operations of CEG.

Neither party has the right to unilaterally terminate the transaction.  Under the PSA the transaction will terminate if not completed by December 31, 2001.


Based on input from various sources in Brazil and on the actions and demeanor of  Petrobras, my judgement is that the delay is being caused by ASEP due to bureaucracy and politics associated with this high profile transaction with a state company.    Petrobras is not acting like a company that does not want to close.  As difficult as it is, my recommendation is to extend our purchase price agreement and wait for the new target date.

"RE:","Hi Morgan,

Now that I do not work for Ken Lay and, as a stockholder, he actually
works for me, I can go directly too him and tell him what I really
think.  I can also tell all of the board members what I think as well,
without fear of getting fired by one of my former politically motivated
bosses.  Ken Lay earned a PHD as an economist.  He knows exactly what I
am talking about.  What he is doing is trying correct many bad Enron
decisions and to find ""easy"" income in a tough time.  He is very good at
""working the floor"", as I call it, of the New York Stock Exchange.  He
has probably made deals with brokers and large mutual fund managers such
as Vanguard and Fidelity for them to repurchase large amounts of Enron
stock IF he can clean up Enron and bring in some revenue.  So far, so
good.  The problem arises when you look at the quality of the revenue
Ken is generating.  What I see is largely from ""one time"" sales of
existing assets and not from continuing operations.  In other words, the
effect is only temporary and it is much harder to re-create at a later
time because the ""asset"" is gone.

Personally, I am not buying into the ""trust me"" line from Enron.  It is
time for Enron's leadership to earn their millions in salary.

Love,
Dad

Importance: High


Ken,

Thank you for your response to my email.  Whether you actually took the
time to respond or left it to one of your assistants, I hope you read my
comments/suggestions and truly understood them.

I have a few more comments and suggestions!

You are correct, overall stock values have declined and Enron has some
additional, unique issues related to its broadband and tele-com
business, payments from California and large investments in foreign
power plants, particularly India.  However, I cannot agree with your
comments (or Jeff's) about short sellers.

Short sellers, like jackals and vultures, exist for a reason and are an
important part of the whole financial community in which we live.  Short
sellers (and Jackals) are always looking for a deal(meal).  When they
find an unhealthy company (animal), they investigate, which oftens leads
to greater opportunities.  Enron, under Jeff's leadership, was not
healthy and the short sellers (jackals) found a wonderful opportunity.

Your current job, as was Jeff Skilling's, is to not provide the short
sellers (jackals) a reason or opportunity to focus on Enron's stock
price.

I applaud your recent commitment to the financial community to provde
better definition regarding Enron's profits.  Developing the necessary
internal mechanism for a largely transparent financial reporting system
will police itself and will ultimately reinforce confidence in Enron's
true value.

As an economist, you need to remember that the market value of any
company, in today's economy, is largely based on the market's perception
of its value. As you and I have so recently seen, the market very often
reacts on preception and only looks at intrinsic value as an
afterthought.  The financial community believes that if it quacks like a
duck and walks like a duck, then....just maybe it is a duck and not
really a racehorse

Enron executives need to be more cognizant of the negative impact their
excessive insider selling of shares has on market preception.  Using
stock options in lieu of salary is a very powerful incentive but it can
also backfire, especially if the proper safe guards are not in place.
Excessive insider trades can and should be limited.

Doing good things for the right reasons works! For some years now,
Northern's leadership has not done many good things for the right
reasons.  They are highly political and have developed a nasty habit of
not telling their upper management (Stan Horton) the truth, but what
Stan wants to hear.  They are doing many things, not because they
should, but becaue they can get away with them.  This activity works
only as long as their customers do not have a choice!  You want
examples-look at the non-Enron pipeline activity in Florida and the
upper midwest.

A solid domestic asset with a reasonable return is much better than the
possibility of much higher returns on assets in unstable, foreign
markets.  Enron is not smarter than the world and the world has
certainly demonstrated that it will not allow Enron to possess very much
control over world affairs.  Let's learn from our mistakes!

Selling difficult assets, such as in India, is good.  Selling profitable
assets, such as Portland General is bad just to make the bollom line
revenue. Warren Buffet, an Omaha native, does not look like such an old
fuddy-duddy as he once did, as recently as last year.  Strong, solid
fandamentals do count and ......

Short sellers will always be around and DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE RIGHT
REASONS truly works!!!

Sincerely,

Neal Shaw

Neal:

I appreciate your recent e-mail concerning the decline in Enron's stock
price.  I share with you a very deep disappointment and frustration
about
this decline.

The decline has occurred for a number of reasons.  First, overall stock
values have declined significantly this year.  Enron's stock price has
declined more than averages primarily because of the total melt down in
the
broadband and tele-com business, difficulties with getting paid by the
California utilities and trouble with our large power plant and LNG
project
in India.  These problems have been further compounded by endless
misinformation and rumors, probably promulgated by short sellers.

In any event, I believe we our making progress in addressing these
various
problems.  I believe our stock price will increase over the short to
intermediate term.  With good success, we will be able to restore most
or
all of the value we lost this year over the not too distant future.

I appreciate your concerns and your suggestions and I will certainly do
everything I can to restore your confidence in Enron.

Sincerely,

Ken

   Ken,

   My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in
   Midland, Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enron's
   Gas Pipeline Group for almost 19 years.  I left the company is
December
   2000. I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron
shares.

   I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under
   duress a major concern. by Jamie Lareau.  This article focused on how
to
   recognize CEO's and CEO candidates who were not up to the
requirements
   of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example.  I have agreed
with
   views of this journalist for some time, especially since Jeff called
a
   fund manager an ""asshole"".  Publically calling someone is simply Not
   something any CEO should do and you and Enron's board should have
done
   something about Jeff then.

   My point is as follows:  Where were you and the Enron Board during
all
   this?  Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton
   virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally
   concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base?  A lot of
   people believed Jeff's hype and many people have suffered!  Has Jeff
   suffered?.  I think not especially since he has left Enron with
millions
   of our dollars in his pocket.  Hopefully he will be able to afford
the
   time off to ""find himself"".

   Did you see the movie ""Top Gun""?  Toward the end of the movie, Tom
   Cruise, otherwise know as Maverick, blamed himself for the loss of
his
   friend and simply disengaged from combat flying.  However, when
things
   got really rough, Maverick re-engaged the enemy and did what he was
   hired to do.

   Do you know where this is going?

   You are once again Enron's ""Top Gun""!  The enemy is Enron's depressed
   stock price.  It is time for you to re-engage and live up to your
title
   of ""Top Gun"" and CEO!  I and the rest of Enron's stock holders need
you
   to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan
   Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix.

   I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job.  If you
are
   not, refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down.

"RE: QUESTIONS REGARDING ADMIN PROMOTIONS","La Donna,

Happy to meet and explain this. Exempt versus non-exempt is more a legal interpretation of what roles at Enron qualify to fall into each of these separate classification. Each has some fairly strict criteria and of course, in so far as why there is a distinction, frequency of pay, applicability overtime and a number of other aspects hinge on which of these applies.

Valeria Hope, Ryan Seleznov and Michelle Cash are greater experts in all aspects of the above, but as I mentioned I would be happy to meet with you to discuss.

Mr. Oxley, as head of Human Resources for Enron North America, I would really appreciate your assistance.  I have met with various HR reps during my nearly eight-year tenure with Enron to understand the qualifications required for an administrative assistant to move into an exempt role.  From those meetings, however, I received severely conflicting information and left with a feeling that there are no rules, or that the rules are made and changed from person to person.  That being said, does HR follow a set of rules that are standard for all non-exempt promotions to exempt roles?  In addition, are qualifications to meet those standards changed with each individual?  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

"Economic Finger Pointing & Flight Safety","============================================================
Crossfire at 7:30 p.m. ET
On January 7, 2002
And online at CNN.com/CROSSFIRE
============================================================

From CNN's Crossfire Staff:

Tonight in the CROSSFIRE... the economy is on the front
burner in Washington and the finger pointing continues
between the two political parties about who is to blame
for the economic downturn. Has President Bush set himself
up to follow the mistakes of his father by declaring that
repeal of his tax cut would come only ""over my dead body""?
Has the White House misrepresented Majority Leader
Daschle's proposals by suggesting he is in favor of a tax
increase? Should everything be on the table in trying to
tackle the nation's economic losses? Will the president
be able to translate his high approval numbers on the
war on terrorism to the domestic front or have the
Democrats found an avenue to political success in 2002?
Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA), Chairman of the Natl. Republican
Congressional Cmte. and Rep. Martin Frost (D-TX),
Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, debate which
party has the best road map for economic recovery.

Then, this weekend a 15-year-old flight student piloted
a small plane into a Tampa office building in an apparent
suicide. Does this incident reveal major gaps in
monitoring general aviation? Should there be a crackdown
and greater regulation at flight schools or is that an
overreaction? Are small planes any more of a threat than
trucks or other vehicles? Could greater restrictions drive
small airports out of business? Mike Pangia, a flight
instructor and former FAA attorney argues that no added
regulations are necessary while former NTSB Managing
Director Peter Goelz says that additional oversight is
a must. They face off tonight.

Join Bill Press and Robert Novak tonight on Crossfire,
7:30pm eastern, 4:30 pacific. On CNN. You won't want to
miss our tale of which state is going to have four

Subject:	Heartfelt Appreciation - Biography
Importance:	High

Ken, Enron Corp was a great empire that found itself vulnerable -- the same as the World Trade Center -- the same as our country's security.  The cost of exposure has been high but a cheap price to pay in the long run for our future generations.  I see Enron in the future.

I have known many great men personally, including Dr. Thomas D. Cronin, the inventor of breast implants (originally invented for breast reconstruction), and William Oldenburg, owner of the LA Express USFL football team, a self-made billionaire, who made and lost  and remade his billions three times.  Although I have yet to have the pleasure of personally knowing you, I have come to know your character.  I believe you will go down in history as one of the great leaders of our times.

Ken, I am a writer and would deeply appreciate if you would authorize me to write your biography (if not all, perhaps through this transition).  I promise that this biography will receive the same standard of excellence you expect from all your employees.  

Please let me know as soon as possible.  There is a lot of work to be done.

Sincerely yours,
Hattie Carrington

Sir,
I read your note with great deal of interest and care.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.

Unfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.

I would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.

thanks

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

"3rd Request","This is the 3rd time that I have attempted to get an
answer to the following question:

Has or was more than one petition been filed before
the bankruptcy court for severance or financial relief
for terminated employees.

At the time of the terminations, we were told in a
group meeting that the $4500 requested and approved by
the judge was the first of several petitions before
the bankruptcy judge for severance on behalf of the
terminated employees.

To date, we have had no response to indicate what, if
any, other petitions are before the court.  An answer
to this question will influence our actions on
individual claims to the court as well as class action
and individual lawsuits.

Would someone within the organization please give us
the courtesy of a response via e-mail or FAQ's?

Since primarily lower level employees were affected by
the terminations, it would seem that some goodwill and
positive PR could be generated by attempting to show
that you did not totally desert us in the process of
lining your pockets.

=====
Sincerely,

June Walker

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Re: PEER GROUP MAPPING","Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

"concerned shareholder  (lay it on the line)","Dear Mr Lay,

I'm not sure if you remember, but I am the one who came up with the Lay it
on the Line slogan.  I am no longer with the company and am currently with
General Electric.
Regardless, I still have a stake in Enron.  Besides everything that is going
on that we can all read in the press, what concerns me is it seems that some
current leaders still don't care.  I was infuriated to learn that Enron (EES
in particular) still rented a corporate house on the golf course for the
tour championship in Houston and was seen grilling steaks, lobsters and
having a great time.   I wouldn't consider it entertaining clients if
Managing Directors such as Dan Leff were there with thier kids (rumor has
it).  That is a completely irresponsible waste of what little money is left
in the company and it shows the arrogance that Enron is perceived to have.
People should be fired for this.   I would hope that Christmas parties,
bonues etc will be scaled down this year and to at least make some sort of
effort to slash costs and get the company back on track.  I have faith in
you as a leader and I hope for a turnaround.  Thank you.

We are not only concerned on the crashed stock but also Enron's
situation in Japan. The business here is too difficult!!!
How do you know the current situation here:

  > Bad Reputation in Japan - if you say you are from Enron people will say
""No""
  > Ignorance of Japanese Business - wasting many time on TOCOM, a market
    controlled by mafia, those minor comnies want to cheat Enron's money
  > Unsatisfactory business environment - deregulation will not proceed in
three
    years
  > Poor manegment - the office is like a kindergarden, the so called
""experts""
    have serious discrimmination with local staff; They do nothing
themselves just
    ask the local ""slave"" to work hard and they go to vacation or business
trip
  > ""Sato"" means sweet in Japanese but Sato Project is not so sweet as you
think!
    Have you expected another ""E-power""?

I have to say we are so dispointed with Enron!!!! Enron Japan is at the
entrance
of ""Bermuda Triangle"", we worry when will it dispear?

If there is anything you need, or any way I can help, please do not
hesitate to call.  There are few leaders who have succeeded through
business transformations--in particular, trasformations that require
internal cultures of disruptiveness or reinvention.  You are one of the
few.  You have always demonstrated the ability and the willingness to
take bold moves in redefining Enron and redefining the energy business.

I believe Sitrick can be extremely helpful to you and the company.  I
have used them and have seen their ability to redefine events and
organize a PR defense and offense in difficult situations.  I told Mike
Sitrick to expect a call from you and asked him to personally, as the
owner and CEO of the company, to handle Enron.

I am a Sr. Buyer for ETS.  I've been with the Company for over 19 years and I just want to tell you that as a long-time employee, I have nothing but the highest admiration and respect for you and the way you tackle the challenges of running this vast corporation.  Sure my financial investment in this company has suffered along with everyone else's but I'm not worried.  Enron is a solid company and you are most capable.  Some of the questions yesterday really irked me because everyone has no problem riding the ""high"" times but do nothing but grumble at the first sign of trouble.  You made this company great and I've no doubt that you can do it again.  I'm not management level and have very, very little impact on the bottom line, but I love this company and  I intend to do the best work that I can do for Enron and I am happy to be here through thick AND thin.

I know that you have the Company's and employees best interest in your heart.  Be encouraged and know that the majority of us think that you're SUPER !!

"Company saving idea","Hi,
My name is Kevin Jackson and I had an idea while at the Body shop today.  Would it be possible to propose that Enron operate as a subsidiary of Dynegy, with the option to become an independent company after two years?  Without understanding the details of the merger conversations and options, it is my feeling that this could be beneficial for both companies.  Enron would obtain the cash infusion that it need, maintaining the culture and pulse of what makes us leaders; and Dynegy would retain its stock value and increase its bottom line profitability by having Enron as a substantial asset to its overall business portfolio.

We as employees of Enron are here because we are proud of a culture that sets us apart from any other company in the world.  Regardless of what is going on around us, we can still stand proud of what we have accomplished and the great talent pool we have here.  I know times are tough for you now as it is for us all, but we will survive and I support and trust your vision that made us a great company.

Thanks and I am interested in your feedback.

I suggest that you look outside the company and find a person with unqestioned experience, intelligence and integrity -- someone with close ties to the financial community -- to join you in the Chairman's office and turn things around.  This person can look the analysits squarely in the eye and tell them to back off while we get back on track.  At this point,  I don't feel that you can only rely on your people here within the company.  And I also don't see how you can take this burden wholly on your shoulders.

"End of the Year Newsletter","To the attention of:
Dr  Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

2001 was an extraordinary year! As it draws to a close, I would like to
share some of my thoughts with you. First of all, I wanted to thank our
members and constituents for their active engagement during the last 12
months, which helped us to move forward in our efforts to serve as a
framework and catalyst for business and society to improve the state of the
world.

In 2001 we implemented ""Forum Plus"" strategy, designed to advance critical
issues on the global agenda through the creation of task forces and
initiatives that integrate business, governments, international
organizations, civil society, academics and technical experts. Today, 11
task forces are already in place. To provide an intellectual and strategic
base for these activities, we have developed and computerized - with the
help of our members and constituents - a comprehensive system for
monitoring some 200 specific items on the global agenda. This tracking
process provides a foundation for action on these ongoing challenges.

To make our foundation a true multi-stakeholder platform we have created a
number of consultative councils (e.g. with NGOs, world religious leaders,
academies of science, etc.) and have, at the same time, strengthened the
role of the business community inside our organization. It is worth noting
that despite the negative trends in the global economy, 2001 was a
successful year for all of our activities. This shows that even in
difficult times there is a great demand for increased interaction among
global decision-makers, and for top-level community building.

The most difficult decision the Forum had to take this year was to move our
Annual Meeting from Davos to New York in the aftermath of the tragic events
of 11 September. From 31 January to 4 February 2002, leaders from business,
governments, academia, religions, the media and civil society will have a
first opportunity to develop an integrated response to these new
circumstances.

The Annual Meeting 2002 is organized around six major challenges we are
facing as a global community:

1. Restoring Sustained Growth
2. Achieving Security, Addressing Vulnerabilities
3. Redefining Business Challenges
4. Reducing Poverty and Achieving Equity
5. Sharing Values and Respecting Differences
6. Re-evaluating Leadership and Governance

The Annual Meeting in New York will be characterized by a workshop-style
approach where all participants will have an opportunity to engage in
shared learning and to have a collective impact. The programme is designed
to stimulate discussion and provide insights that will help us better cope
with the fragility of our times. The response to our invitations has been
overwhelming: All the key personalities will be present.

Please note that this year, instead of sending Christmas cards, we have
made a donation to the Nelson Mandela Foundation to help build schools for
needy children. My 150 colleagues and I look forward to joining forces with
you in the New Year, in the spirit of entrepreneurship in the global public
interest, to ""improve the state of the world."" My very best wishes
accompany you in your contemplation at the end of the year and particularly
for a healthy and successful 2002.

Klaus Schwab
Founder and President
World Economic Forum

"RE: Appointment","Rosie...absolutely!!  I'll make my schedule work.  However, unless this is a personal favor Ken is doing for the gentlemen involved, I'd also be happy to ""field"" this for him.  I told Ken we(University Affairs/Public Affairs) would not impose on his schedule for these kinds of visits until after January.  Clearly, there are occasions where some of Ken's many friends contact him directly, and , as kind as Ken is, even at extreme times, he agrees.   However, if this is not a personal visit, I'm quite certain this dean is looking for a better financial and recruiting relationship with Enron.  In fact, we are putting together a ""master Plan"""" financial relationship with UT overall (Rick Causey is the exec lead), and realistically, we are not recruiting engineers per se.  So Rosie my darling friend, let me know if you'd like me to politely intervene and take this off your list, or if this  is one of those personal friendship situations, in which case, I'll be there on the 14th!
 
Thanks and kisses!!

Ken,
 
 
It was a pleasure meeting you on the panel at the Fortune CEO Forum on  Philanthropy and then seeing you again at Davos.  That was my first  time at Davos and it was quite a privilege and experience for me. 
 
I am sending you some info on SeaChange because I wanted to see  if you will consider supporting our efforts.
 
I know you heard what SeaChange does when you and I were on the panel,  but I have attached some documents, like our 2-page Fact Sheet, our FAQs and  our strategic partnerships, so you can see what has transpired.   
 
I have more information which I can send, but I did not want to bombard  you with any more attachments.  Also, we go live on our website on August  28, but if you want to take a look at the beta site,  it is http://beta.sea-change.org .
 
 
I hope you will observe that we have been successful at developing our  partnerships, our staff, our Board of Directors and Board of Advisors, our  selection criteria for social entrepreneurs, our recruitment process and our  technology.  We have worked hard and patiently and are now poised to  officially launch SeaChange.
 
As for the financials, you will see that we were  successful in raising funds beyond the initial few funders, we stayed under  budget and spent according to our means.  However, because our burn rate  is significantly higher as we ramp up for our Preview Period (beginning August  28) and our Launch (October), we need more support.  
 
I hope that you find this  report informative and that you are encouraged by our progress.  If you  should have any questions please let me know.
 
I hope you are doing well too.  I look  forward to hearing from you.  Thanks and have a great  weekend.

"Salary","Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson

Labor Conditions and Worker Rights in China and Hong Kong

Monday, January 28, 2002, 3:00-5:00 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI

China's supply of cheap labor has drawn textile and electronic manufacturing jobs from the United States and many developing Asian countries. These jobs have not necessarily brought prosperity to the majority of Chinese workers-in fact, discontent has grown. An excess of unemployed rural workers and an increase in laid-off workers from closed or privatized state-owned enterprises has produced an angry and demoralized workforce. Worker demonstrations have been mounted in all parts of China, many regarding corruption in factory management. Some China watchers view this worker unrest as a recipe for instability and eventual chaos. The members of this panel suggest a possible solution: independent worker organizations in which workers can protect their own interests and contribute to the solution of some of the nation's economic problems, particularly corruption, through a democratic process. Panelists will also address related issues in Hong Kong.

"Fed Ex","Dear Kenneth, 
I have sent this morning a Fed Ex package to your office to arrive tomarrow Friday morning containing our school video.  I hope you will enjoy it and share it with Linda.  We are in the process of making an updated video about the school that will be debuted at the Gala in April.  I know with last weeks events everything has slowed down.  I will be eager to hear about Mrs. Bush once her schedule gets back to some normalcy.  I do so appreciate your  help with this.  It is hard for us all to even think about the fund raiser at a time like this, but life does go on and preparing our children is the utmost and highest priority on our list.  William and I have poured our lives into this school as you know we all do when we have a passion for something.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.  God bless and thanks again.

"Electricity restructuring","FYI.  A paper prepared for the  20th Annual Conference, Center for Research in Regulated Industries, Rutgers University, May 25, 2001, is available on my web page at:http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/whogan 
or www.whogan.com .
  ""ELECTRICITY MARKET RESTRUCTURING: REFORMS OF REFORMS"" 
Abstract:  Electricity systems present complicated challenges for public policy.  In many respects these challenges are similar to those in other network industries in providing a balance between regulation and markets, public investment and private risk taking, coordination and competition.  As with other such industries, naturally monopoly elements interact with potentially competitive services, but electricity has some unusual features that defy simple analogy to other network industries.  Following a reversal of a long-term decline in real electricity prices, the last two decades of the twentieth century were for the United States a time of reform, reaction, and reforms of reforms in electricity systems, moving slowly towards greater reliance on competition and markets. Changing technology, new entrants in the generation market, and a legislative mandate to provide access to the essential transmission facility accelerated a process that required major innovations in institutions and operations. Complete laissez faire competition is not possible, and the details of an efficient competitive electricity market are neither obvious nor easy to put in place. The benefits of reform may be substantial, but they require careful attention to market design. A review of the past identifies some choices on the road ahead.

"I want to check the possibility of conducting an interview with you","
14.01.02

Dear Mr. Kenneth L. Lay

As the Editor-in-Chief of TheMarker and a senior columnist for Ha'aretz
newspaper in Israel, I want to check the possibility of conducting an
interview with you on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in New
York this month.

I'm going to be in New York covering the WEF from January 31st' to
February 1st' and I would be obliged if you will be able to give us a
short interview during the days of the convention.

Let me add some information about myself and our publications:

I am the Editor-in-Chief of TheMarker and a senior financial columnist
of the Ha'aretz daily newspaper in Israel.

Since 1994 I write a daily column in Ha'aretz about financial markets,
economic policy, technology and matters of corporate strategy. The
column is regarded as one of the most influential column in the Israeli
press.

I am also the Editor-in-Chief and the found of TheMarker - a Ha'aretz
subsidiary that publishes Israel's most popular financial online news
service and Israel's monthly business Magazine.

Ha'aretz is Israel's most reliable source of local and international
daily news and commentary. Ha'aretz addresses the country's decision
makers in matters of policy, culture and business. Ha'aretz is also the
oldest daily newspaper in Israel, established in 1919.  Ha'aretz
publishes an English version with the International Herald Tribune.

TheMarker is the Ha'aretz subsidiary that focuses on business and
financial news and commentary. TheMarker publishes Israel's first and
most and influential financial online service and Israel's monthly print
business magazine. TheMarker online news service is also published in
English  (www.themarker.com/eng).

I have 14 years of experience in Journalism. I was the Business editor
of Ha'aretz, the financial markets editor and a financial reporter. I
was the financial reporter for the IDF radio and I am a regular
commentator on radio today.








I hold a Master in Business Administration from The Kellogg School of
Northwestern University and The Recanati School of Tel Aviv University
and a B.A in economics from the Tel Aviv University.

I hope that you will be able to grant me the interview, and thank you in
advance for your kind consideration.

Sincerely yours,

"Reorganization Team","Dear Mr. Lay,

You should hire me to be part of the strategic planning/reorganization team
addressing Enron's current situation. Whether your goal is to salvage the
company or to attract buyers, I can add value to this effort.

My qualifications are the following. I have been a ""Big 5"" consultant. I can
identify recommendations whose implementation was never considered during
analysis. I have worked in a variety of industries and learned the ropes
quickly for each. I have a graduate degree, but I worked in the real world
while I earned it. I am not a ""yes"" man and don't believe in sucking up. I
make decisions and am accountable for my actions.

Your company will be remembered as an MBA case study. Some ambitious
professor is probably penning the intial draft as I send this e-mail. But
the ending for that case study has not been written, and I'd like to have a
hand in determining the outcome. I've attached my resume and respectfully
request an interview. You can reach me at (972) 979-6609 to schedule a
meeting.

Thanks for your time,
Bianca Hayes

As you are aware, there are  many families that have been affected by the recent layoffs at Enron.  I  along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler and Sue Nix) have been working  on a project which will provide assistance to ex-employees of Enron. We wanted  to do something to help our fellow employees and also provide a tool that others  could use to provide assistance to ex-Enron employees. This week, we've been  working with an attorney and a local bank. An account has been set up where  people can make contributions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron  employees that need assistance with basic necessities, such as money for food,  rent/mortgage payments, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the  information so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our  ability to provide assistance will be based on the response we receive.  As  you can see, we're using our values from Enron to help others, and would  appreciate your assistance with communicating this information to the current  Enron employees.  
Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron  employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees.   If you need to speak with me or have any questions, I can be reached at  281-812-2466.

"Invitation to Participate - CERA Leadership Circle","Dr. Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman & CEO
Enron Corp.

Dear Dr. Lay:

You are cordially invited to participate as our guest in the 2002 CERA
Leadership Circle, to be held in conjunction with our annual Executive
Conference in Houston, Texas, February 10-15, 2002. The Leadership
Circle is an exclusive program that is one of the highlights of
CERAWeek, bringing together top decision-makers in the global energy
community for informal peer-level discussions and presentations by
thought leaders. The proceedings are informal and relaxed, designed to
maximize ideas, exchange, and relationship building. Participation is by
invitation only and is exclusively for senior executives and ministerial
officials.

The Leadership Circle will commence Sunday, February 10th with dinner.
The program continues Monday afternoon and features breakfast discussion
sessions Tuesday through Friday. This year's program will be
particularly timely and important. Our focus is on the new dynamics of
geopolitics, the global security agenda, the economic future, and the
new battle over globalization and the marketplace. Our aim is to offer
thoughtful insight on the future political and economic landscape and
what this means for energy.

We hope you will join us for this unique opportunity to share
experiences and perspectives at this time of great turbulence and
change. We will be sending you a formal letter of invitation later in
January. The Leadership Circle will commence Sunday, February 10th with
dinner. The program continues Monday afternoon and features breakfast
discussion sessions Tuesday through Friday.

As a family, we own an approximate $700 million in Exxon stock and maintain excellent relationships with several investment banks.

"Stock Price","Dear Mr. Lay,

These are difficult times for Enron.  I know that you, members of your Management Team and the Board of Directors are working diligently to turn the tide that has resulted in the significant deterioration of our stock price.  In this regard, I request that you and the Board of Directors give consideration to extending for one year all options that your employees are currently vested in and are coming to the end of their term within the next 12 months, commencing November 1, 2001.  Many of us do not have the opportunity to receive the numbers of options that senior management has, and that is expected.  But, this so sudden drop in stock price has placed many if not all current options underwater.  A decision by the Board of Directors, in favor of this type of supportive action would go a long way for your employees morale and commitment to the company.  Thank you,  Doug

The Consumer-Welfare Benefits from Bell Company Entry into Long-Distance
Communications: Empirical Evidence from New York and Texas

Abstract:
For years, the effect of entry by the Bell operating companies (BOCs) into in-region interLATA long-distance markets has been the subject of conjecture and debate. Although economic theory suggests why substantial price reductions will occur upon BOC entry, many regulatory economists nonetheless conjectured that such entry would not benefit consumers significantly. Now that regulators have issued the first authorizations for BOCs to commence in-region interLATA service, it is possible to test that conjecture
empirically. In this Article, we report empirical findings that BOC entry has produced substantial consumer-welfare benefits in New York and Texas in the form of lower prices for long-distance service. We find statistically significant evidence that BOC entry enabled the average consumer to reap a 9-percent savings on her monthly interLATA bill in New York and a 23-percent savings in Texas. In addition, we find statistically significant evidence that competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) have a substantially higher
cumulative share of the local exchange market in states where BOC entry has occurred. This empirical evidence is highly relevant to the BOCs' many remaining applications to provide in-region interLATA service in other states. That evidence also reveals the extent to which the framework used by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to evaluate BOC applications for in-region interLATA service has failed to account fully for the interests of consumers. This framework has assumed that BOC entry would not significantly lower long-distance prices. But the empirical evidence has demonstrated that this assumption is incorrect. In an attempt to remedy a perceived market failure, the FCC and the DOJ produced a regulatory failure whose losses in consumer welfare run into billions of dollars annually.

"The Center for Houston's Future -- Capital Campaign","Susie Lewis in Exxon-Mobil's Public Affairs Department called me today
for an update on The Center's capital campaign.

Terry Koonce has just passed on to her The Center's funds solicitation
packet for consideration and Susie wanted to know how corporations,
other than Enron, are responding to The Center's request.

I indicated to her that the follow-up calling was just beginning and
that as soon as I could give her an update, I would.  I tried to get
information from her regarding Exxon-Mobil's take on the request.  She
hesitated a bit.  I said that the request was for an effort of the
business community that was unprecedented in the history of Houston.
She agreed and said that Exxon-Mobil has two guiding factors in funding
any effort:  1) the potential for impact on E-M business 2) the
philanthropic value.  She went on to indicate that attracting workforce
to the Houston region was a key necessity of E-M.  She also agreed that
unless this region had a plan, it would be left behind.  She was upbeat,
asked intelligent questions and appeared genuinely interested in and
enthusiastic about The Center's efforts.  She has asked that I call her
back next week.

In addition, Dennis Winkler, Manager, Community Relations - Houston for
Shell (and Partnership liaison for Steve Miller) approached me at the
Partnership's board meeting on Tuesday to chat about The Center.  He
mentioned the fact that Steve Miller had asked him to go to Shell's
Foundation and put Center for Houston's Future in line to receive
funding.  Note:  Dennis did this prior to our solicitation packet being
mailed.

I asked Dennis if Steve had received The Center's solicitation packet
and if so, had Dennis heard any comment.  He said that he didn't know,
but asked for a copy of the packet.  This was sent to him.  I am setting
up a lunch with Dennis next week at his request to talk about The
Center.

Please let me know how to proceed. At this point, I have not received
the final list of your calling preferences.  If I can fill-in or
customize the list for you to facilitate your follow-up telephone
calling effort, please let me know.  I would be more than glad to help.
Thank you for all of your help.

"stockholder comments","Dear Dr. Lay:

As a stockholder, I am as upset as you, most Enron employees and other
co-shareholders are given Enron's recent performance due to questionable
management by scrupulous officers at Enron.

As an ex-employee, I have seen many signs of a major collapse, given the
fact that Enron's values (such as Respect, Integrity, Communicatons and
Excellence) were simply not followed by Enron's officers and senior members
of management.  There are examples, such as in Panama, Palestine, and the
Dominican Republic.  One bad deal after the other with questionable
economics and accounting to make each deal look good for the personal
benefit of one individual in charge.

It is about time that you get rid of these individuals and bring Enron back
to what you have built over the years to be a successful company.

Regards,

ken booi

"CSIS Column on Treating the Causes of the Terrorist Attack","This message contains the text of Sidney Weintraub's Issues in International Political Economy for the month of October.

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
October 2001, Number 22

THE TERRORIST ATTACK: TREATING THE CAUSES
Sidney Weintraub

We have been hearing much since September 11 that the United States, to avoid future terrorist attacks, must treat the causes. Which causes? Should the treatment deal with reversing the terrorists' hatred for the United States, eliminating anti-Jewish sentiment, correcting the lack of freedom in most Middle-Eastern countries, refighting the Kosovo war and getting some Americans killed, making too many or too few charges against foreign human rights violations, eliminating homosexuality and civil liberties in the United States (as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson seem to believe), altering the capitalist system that prevails in the developed countries, changing the U.S. lifestyles that so infuriate Muslim zealots, reducing poverty?

No shortage of ""causes,"" some outrageous, others idiosyncratic, and some even with a sense of legitimacy, have been put forward that should be treated. The monthly commentaries in this issues series deal with political economy and I will stick (mostly) to the last and focus on poverty. However, this must be prefaced with a caveat. I find it impossible that anyone can seriously believe that because there is much poverty in the Middle East, terrorists who are not themselves poor concluded that the corrective was to attack the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon and kill thousands of innocent people.

I am focusing on poverty because it is a global scourge and we would have a better world if poverty could be reduced drastically. One consequence of the events on September 11 will be to sharply increase poverty because of the ripple effects on developing countries from the economic troubles of the United States and other industrial countries. Markets for the goods and services of developing countries will shrink, as will investment in them. When the economies of rich countries decline, the suffering from the fallout is usually greater in poor countries. This, for better or worse, is part of globalism.

Many implicitly assume that the reduction of poverty has been neglected up until now. This is not true. What is correct, however, is that the world has not been overwhelmingly effective in dealing with the problem. The number of people who live below the poverty line is now about 1.3 billion. This is an enormous figure, even though the proportion of the world's population living in poverty has declined more in the past 50 years than in the previous 500 years. The absolute number, however, has risen.

Poverty is not an independent manifestation isolated from development strategies and politics within countries, but part and parcel of the bigger picture. I have not understood the motivations of the protesters who show up to disrupt meetings of international development and trade organizations because precisely these institutions have taken the lead to reduce poverty. Poverty did not begin with globalization. The proportion of people living in poverty has not increased because globalization has made communications and financial transfers more efficient than ever before. If anything, globalization is an opportunity to reduce levels of poverty because linkages between developed and developing countries are now so intense.

Poverty reduction clearly goes hand-in-hand with economic growth. Overall economic growth is insufficient to reduce poverty, but it is the essential ingredient. Redistribution without growth merely rearranges the scenery, but does not get at the core of the problem. Poverty-reduction policy, therefore, must be an ingredient of development policy. And that is the rub; no simple, sure-fire formula exists for converting a stagnant, low-income country into a vibrant one with a growing economy.

Development is a slow, slogging, arduous process that must deal with big-picture matters, such as macroeconomic policy, and microeconomic issues of industrial and agricultural development and the building of solid institutions. Education must be a priority, and this cannot be accomplished in one decade or one generation. Infant mortality is higher and life expectancy is lower in developing countries because of inadequate health care. Countries need roads to bring goods to market, equity in land tenure, ports, an adequate and safe water supply, and the infrastructure that makes development possible. Poverty reduction, if all of these needs are met, must then be a conscious part of government programs, which is why bumper-sticker slogans like ""Reduce Poverty"" are fatuous. By all means, let us work to reduce poverty, but the issue must be treated more seriously than a politician's or an editorialist's spin might suggest.

The history of today's developed countries, as widely documented, is that poverty actually increased during the early years of the development process. Investments during the early days of the growth process tended to direct resources to immediately productive activities and only after the cumulative effects of these development accomplishments reached a pivotal point did poverty and inequality decline. Thus one may make a case for directing more resources to developing countries, but they must be part of a viable development program. And, yes, the United States has not in recent years been a generous aid donor in relation to the U.S. gross domestic product. Politicians say that foreign aid is not popular because it helps foreigners. Yes, it does, but what is wrong with that?

The discussion of poverty reduction can be brought specifically to the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Most people in those regions, which seem to be the cradle of the terrorism movement, live in poverty. Not a single country in the Middle East, save Israel, has a democratic government. Population growth rates are high and this adds to the costs of development. Yet, the priorities of dictatorial leaders, whether religious or otherwise, are not economics-or reducing poverty-but a host of other issues, from religious fanaticism to political dominance to a hatred of neighbors.

Is this situation mainly the fault of the United States? Does the existence of Israel impoverish its Arab enemies? The answer to both questions is, of course, no. Has the United States made errors in the ways it has interacted with countries in the Middle East? Has Israel? Yes, both countries have. But to then leap from this to the assertion that the attacks were justified, that the United States got what it deserved, is insane. Has the United States provided benefits and favors to countries in the Middle East? The answer is surely yes, more so than any other country.

Countries make their own development policies. Unless a country makes a development policy its own, the reality that aid will accomplish little has long been a truism among development-assistance practitioners. Donor countries and agencies can give advice and provide technical and financial resources, but they cannot impose programs that national leaders do not want, a lesson that has been learned repeatedly. Aid donors cannot eliminate corruption; leaders of countries must do that. The donors cannot insist that dictatorial regimes be transformed into democracies; they can withhold aid or they can grant it and hope that some start at development will lead to more satisfactory regimes. If economic development and the installation of democracy are unimportant in the agendas of foreign leaders, neither the United States nor other donors have much power to alter the situation.

To return to where this commentary began, poverty is a deep-seated plague, one that the world must deal with on moral and practical grounds. However, it is impossible to will away poverty; this takes consistent dedication. Poverty has been reduced sharply in some countries because their leaders and priorities of governance sincerely sought economic growth and poverty reduction. The number of poor has been reduced as a proportion of world population because of the economic system put into effect after World War II. However, the job is far from accomplished and deserves a sustained effort to do better in the future.

NewPower Conducting Three Innovative Energy-Saving Pilot Programs In Philadelphia To Help Consumers Control Their Energy Costs

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 31, 2001-- Some 300 Philadelphia households will soon participate in three pioneering pilot programs that will test consumer's reaction to energy saving technology. 

The programs will be launched next month by The New Power Company(TM), a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc., with technology and services provided by the Carrier Corporation, Shadowpack Inc., Coactive Networks, National Family Opinion Research (NFO) and Sargent Electric Company. 

The three pilots consisting of 100 households each will include: a time-of-use metering pilot; an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) load control pilot; and an interactive home gateway pilot. The interactive home gateway pilot will allow consumers to remotely access their thermostat from any Internet-enabled device. 

""As NewPower has advocated since its inception, energy restructuring leads to technological innovation, efficiency and environmental benefits,' said H. Eugene Lockhart, The New Power Company's president and chief executive officer.  ""These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy needs.""
 
Here are additional details on each of the three pilots: 
?	Participants in pilot program ``A'' will have time-of-use meters installed in their homes. These meters record daily energy use and will enable 		NewPower to better understand typical energy consumption patterns. 

?	In pilot program ``B,'' the HVAC load control pilot, Carrier's Comfortstat(TM) programmable thermostat will be installed in 100 homes. The purpose 	of this pilot is to gauge customers' reaction to having NewPower remotely alter their thermostat setting by 2 to 6 degrees to help the homeowner 		better manage their energy usage and costs. 

?	Under pilot program ``C,'' NewPower's remote energy management system will allow consumers to change their thermostat setting from any 		Internet-accessible device, including a PC, ``smart'' mobile phone or PDA. However, unlike pilot ``B,'' the customer always remains in control and 		may instantaneously override the adjustment at any time from the Web or a wireless device. 

Sargent Electric Company will install and service the energy management systems throughout the duration of the pilot programs. Their professional installers will complete the system installation in a matter of hours and provide helpful user instruction. 

The pilot programs will run from early June to the end of September -- the peak season for energy consumption. Homeowners are currently being recruited by NFO Research, and, as part of the pilot, will be asked to complete a number of short surveys about how they use the system and their feelings about new product concepts. 

Coactive Networks will provide the heart of the interactive home gateway system in pilot ``C.'' This first-of-its-kind technology uses home networking to enable real-time monitoring and control of devices over the Internet without requiring any new wires in the home. Shadowpack has built the system's Web and wireless user interfaces and will provide the back-end infrastructure necessary to carry out customer requests. Shadowpack's services allow for seamless connectivity from almost any Internet accessible device.

"","Dear Mr. Lay,

Thank you for you leadership during our ""crisis"".  You have demonstrated strength, character, and integrity so far, and I am certain that you will continue to do so.  We all need you.

You have many people praying for you.  Even within our own walls at Enron, there are several Bible Studies that occur throughout the week.  We have already lifted you up in prayer and will continue to do so.

During this trying time, please do not become so weary that you forget where and who your source and strength come from.  The Lord is there to give you comfort, peace, love, and strength.  You are His child. Seek His face and let your dependency be on Him.  He will not fail you.  He never does.

I know that you are a busy man so I will keep this short.

Our prayers are with you.
Your sister in Christ,
Sonya Gasdia

"Interview","
In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I recently had an opportunity to visit with Stan Horton. Stan provided some wonderful insight on his leadership skills and gave you as an example of a superb leader. He suggested that I also speak with about your views on leadership. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events you think coelesced to bring you to the chairmanship of Enron; what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a signficant change in your career.

If you would have fifteen minutes or so and would be amenable, I would much appreciate visiting with you in the next two-three weeks. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.

Dear Ken,
 A lot has happened since our conversation in snowy  Washington at Joe Hilling's retirement reception.  Unable to identify a mutually agreed  upon challenge for me, I retired from Enron with the objective of providing  business leadership elsewhere.  Many  others, including Jeff Skillings, have since departed as well.  Reflecting on the events of the past  several months, I would like to talk with you regarding how my extensive  experience in managing and divesting Enron's foreign and domestic businesses and  assets could be utilized by the company on an interim basis.  My goal is to assist your efforts in  restoring investor confidence in and shareholder value of Enron, which has been  an integral part of my life for 30 years.
 I will contact your office next week to find a  convenient time for us to visit on this matter.
 Best regards,
 Mike Dahlke

I feel like I am in a bad dream and when I wake up all this merger stuff will be a joke.  Why Dynegy?  The culture is so different.  I had the opportunity to work

truly believe another solution will come to surface.  Hopes and Prays can developed us all from this disappointment.

"Houston 2012 Olympic Committee","Mr. Lay,

Per my conversation with Rosie, I wanted to inform you of a couple of items regarding the Houston 2012 Olympic Committee.  Yesterday, I received a call from Susan Bandy (Executive Director, Houston 2012) advising me that she and George DeMontrond came to meet with you regarding your potential involvement and role in the Houston Olympic bid effort.

I wanted to make you aware that Mark Frevert and I are on the Board of the Houston 2012 Olympic Committee.  When I joined Enron in 1999, I was asked by Joe Sutton to replace him on the Advisory Board Committee.  We've been involved with the organization since then, and this past June, Mark Frevert became a member of the Board of Directors.  I would like to offer my services to you at any level possible with this initiative, from coordination/development of activities to attending meetings or researching opportunities.  If you need any additional details concerning our involvement with Houston 2012, I would be more than happy to do a full briefing.  

This is just one of many initiatives we are working on. We continuously keep members of the executive committee and office of the chairman through M. Frevert, engaged in our efforts. If we can be of assistance to you on this matter or any other related to sports, sponsorships and event marketing items, please don't hesitate to call.
  
Thank you.

"Terrorist Threat to Nuclear/Energy Infrastructure: Western Response","Western law enforcement authorities are uncertain as to the form of possible follow-up terrorist attacks by bin Ladin, but much concern continues to be focused on the threat to infrastructure targets, and particularly nuclear power stations.  US and Canadian authorities have stepped up security considerably, but neither plant security nor plant structures were designed to withstand a strike by a large airliner.  UK law enforcement officials privately object to the UK government's position that Irish terrorists still represent a greater threat to power stations and gas terminals than do other international terrorists, and are maintaining a higher level of security than that dictated by the government.  New security measures will increase costs for nuclear operators and fuel the debate on nuclear power.

An FBI contact has informed us that law enforcement authorities do not know what to expect in the form of follow-up terrorist attacks.  He believes that bin Ladin would use different elements within his organization and a different modus operandi, making it difficult to foresee and prevent such attacks.  Training at bin Ladin camps is known to include attacks on infrastructure targets, such as power stations.  Much of the focus among Western authorities has been on the threat to national energy assets, and particularly nuclear power plants.  Although nuclear plants are among the most hardened structures constructed and are generally designed to withstand extreme natural events (eg, earthquakes and tornadoes), attacks by large aircraft were never considered in the design process.  The traditional security approach at these plants is consequently inadequate.

Response to this perceived threat has varied from country to country:

The security posture of US nuclear plants has been elevated to the highest level since immediately after the attacks.  This has involved increased patrols, augmented forces, heightened coordination among relevant authorities, and limited access to installations -- all representing little defense against a fully fueled airliner.

Nuclear regulatory authorities in both Canada and the US are working with intellience and law enforcement authorities to review existing procedures and are seeking to identify measures to address the expanded threat.  Authorities have established a secure air space around nuclear facilities.  Security at major hydroelectric sites and oil fields has also been tightened to protect against attacks which could strike a major blow to the US and Canadian economies.  New security measures are certain to increase costs for nuclear operators, and fuel the debate on the economics and safety of nuclear power.

Meanwhile, the assessed threat to power plants in the UK has been reduced to relatively low levels after briefly being stepped up.  An MI5 contact informed us privately that the government has adopted the official line that Irish groups currently pose a greater threat to UK power stations and gas terminals than do other international terrorist groups.  London Metropolitan Police and Scotland Yard officials have informed us that they object to this position by the government, and are in fact maintaining a higher level security posture than dictated by the government.  Local law enforcement officials have identified 180 ""Key Economic Points"" in the London area that require close monitoring, including public transportation, water supply, telecommunications, electricity and gas facilities.  MI5 has primary responsibility for protecting similar key points outside of London.

"2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM","
Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

 

Jeffrey McMahon and Ray Bowen

"American Heart Association","Dear Ken,

I wrote you some time back about the campaign to raise ca. $4 million to
replace the American Heart Association's Houston regional headquarters
building which burned this past April.  You were so kind in putting us in
touch with Cindy Olson and Misha Siegel to discuss Enron's corporate
position and the potential for assistance from the Ken and Linda Lay
Foundation.  We deeply appreciated our meeting with Cindy and Misha.

Things have been progressing I'm pleased to say.  AHA has concluded a deal
to sell the restored old building for approximately $1.15 million, and we
have received substantial commitments from a very few individuals and
Houston area foundations totaling approximately $600,000.  Therefore, our
remaining challenge is to raise around $2-$2.25 million to complete the
funding of a new building that will meet the needs of AHA in the years to
come.

We have not yet been able to identify a very visible corporate or
professional lead for the effort.  We will be discussing this possibility
with Ernie Cockrell on November 6th.  As part of that conversation we would
like to indicate notable leaders in Houston who would be willing to have
their names affiliated with the capital campaign, perhaps as an Executive
Committee or Advisory Committee.  The question to you is:  Would you approve
the use of your name in your capacity at Enron and/or the name of the Ken
and Linda Lay Foundation in this way?

Again, the AHA and I have been so deeply appreciative of your willingness to
support the American Heart Association for so many years.  I hope we can
call on you for this additional assistance at a time of need.

Thanks, Ken, for your consideration.

Best regards,


Mike Stinson

I appreciate the time you took to review my memo concerning internal communications suggestions. Cindy Olson called to thank me and Sarah Davis did meet with me to discuss the memo. 

I have some ideas regarding the transition and would like to share them with you and/or your communication transition team.  Could you please put me in contact with your team handling the communications for the transition or meet with me personally to discuss?  I would only take a few minutes of your time.

HEALTH POLICY DISCUSSION
The OxyContin ""Crisis""-Who's to Blame?

Thursday, February 7, 2002, 10:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI
1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

The pharmaceutical drug OxyContin is a potent pain reliever, often the only help for hundreds of thousands of patients who suffer serious, relentless aches. The drug has recently been in the spotlight for its use as a street narcotic, sold on the black market and responsible for addiction and overdose deaths. In nearly all cases OxyContin addicts are established substance abusers and not patients suffering from pain. In order to obtain a heroin-like high, these addicts crush the pill to make it more powerful and fast-acting.
	The Drug Enforcement Administration and several state attorneys general are blaming ""aggressive marketing"" by OxyContin's manufacturer (Purdue Pharma) for what has been called an ""Oxy abuse epidemic."" Trial lawyers are filing class action suits against the company. Who is responsible for the abuse of OxyContin? This AEI discussion will include:

Importance:	High

This is an amazing letter and I am so happy that Mr. White stands behind us! 

I was born and raised in Houston and worked in Houston through the good times and the bad. I agree wholeheartedly with his article and trust that our company is working hard to make things right. Whether I am laid off or allowed to stay this year, I will always stand behind this company!  I worked 10 years at HL&P as an electrical field engineer from 1977 to 1987--through gas lines and recessions and all kinds of internal problems. I know what it's like to feel belittled because the media makes such a ruckus about company policies that we had to paint over the HL&P bullet logo on our company cars and say that we worked for Houston Industries, not Houston Lighting and Power. Shoot, I even had to face a double-barrel shotgun because I had on a company uniform with HL&P on it!  Well, we made it through it and now HL&P is Reliant Energy, so restoration is always possible. I worked side-by-side with those committed Enron employees (most I had never met) helping to clean mud-laden homes from the tropical storm this year, and I was so proud to say to my friends that Enron allowed it's employees to be a part of the community clean-up. My daughter is a senior who volunteered her time during Earth Day festivities here and met other young, innovative people who became her new friends. I want her to keep this positive attitude about our company. I've worked for DuPont, Xerox and Baroid, MCI and Worldcom, and Lyondell and other corporate giants in the past 10 years. Not one ever offered the kind of monetary help (not to mention excellent benefits and raises) that Enron always provides. 

I just want to say, Ken, keep up the good work!  I'm proud to be an Enron employee, and yes, even an EBS employee!!

Subject:	Daily Update


Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Dear Dr. Lay,

We are looking forward to your participation at the upcoming ""Markets
in Transition"" symposium at Rice University on January 10, 2002.

Invitations to the event were sent approximately two weeks ago.  The
invitations listed the agenda and speakers.  We have completed
incorporating the biography and photograph that you provided into the
program brochure.

During the event, we have allocated 20 minutes, beginning at 1:40PM,
for your remarks on Markets in Transition.  We expect your remarks to
be broad in scope and to provide your views on how the economic and
market factors of recession, technology evolution, and heightened
security are impacting the business landscape.  Our hope is that your
remarks will be generic in nature -- Markets in Transition is a
concept that applies to virtually all industries.

We understand that you will make no reference to Enron.  Furthermore,
there will be no question and answer session after your presentation.
We will take measures to ensure that the press has no access to you
before or after your remarks.

Please return the speaker logistics form (requested separately) at
your earliest convenience.

We look forward to your participation.  Please contact me or Brad
Burke, Associate Director of the Rice Alliance (713-348-6136), if you
wish additional information.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

"Shoes","
Hello family and friends,
 
I am in charge of collecting shoes for the needy  (C.C.S.C.) via Nicholas' class at River Oaks Baptist School.  These shoes  can be children's, men's, women's.  These shoes can be slippers, tennis  shoes, boots, dress shoes or good ole fashion walking shoes.  I am  more than happy to do a pick up so that you do not have to go out of your  way.  One pair or many pairs, I'll take what I can get to help out people  that NEED shoes.  Let me know if you have any and when it is convenient for  me to pick them up.  The annual shoe drive ends on October 4th so please  clean out your closets before then and give away what you are not going to  use.
 
Thank you and God Bless,
 
Robyn

"I Am Happy!!!","Hello Mr. Kenneth Lay,

I hope you don't mind an email from someone who is not very high
in the decision-making level of Enron but I have such strong need 
to share my thoughts and visions with you.

First, I am so happy that we are not going to be acquired by Dynegy.
Enron is an entity that deserves to live on.  

Second, I have a vision that we (Enron) become a ""Wiser & Quieter"" Enron.

I wish I can do something to help raise the ""millions/billions"" of dollars needed
to survive in the shortrun, but all I can do is continue working on my project
as I have done before....

I personally do not mind the company shrinking to a very modest level
in the next 12-48 months, selling off core businesses, and adopting a more
cautious role to ALL spending.  Even if we are layed-off we can always 
come back in the future.

Third, I just want to share an imagery of Enron being strong again in the future...
Not with the previous ostentatiousness that prevailed in ""the old days"" but with 
a newly developed sense of Wisdom and Maturity.  
...And there will be articles in the Wall Street Journal about how the Enron giant 
has slowly but consistently lifted itself out of the gutter to become a 
""Wiser & Quieter Enron"".

If there is anything I can do to help you in this endeavor please let me know.
I have no strong family obligations that prevent me from working long hours
on some additional short-term projects to help out my Enron.

Best Wishes!

"A Personal Thanks","Dear Dr. Lay,

On  Friday, September 8, 2000, I was on a business trip in Findlay, Ohio meeting with Marathon Ashland Petroleum Company Inc. We had recently signed a  five year  electric deal in Houston covering their  Illinois pipeline and terminal facilities behind four utlities. I was there at their request to review other opportunities in Illinois and Ohio and present them with small gifts over a celebration dinner with their spouses. On Saturday, September 9, 2000 at approximately 5:30 am I was struck in my car by an eighteen wheeler passing traffic in a no passing zone.
Your kindness in providing my wife and I with your personal jet so that I could transfer from the Toledo trauma facility I was in, to a local hospital in our home state of New Jersey was greatly appreciated. I needed to be with my daughters and family and be fully evaluated for the multiple traumas I suffered. Getting home meant everything to us at the time, and there were no good alternatives before your generous gesture.
Since last year I have had three surgeries and am preparing for cervical spine surgery October 23, 2001, followed by knee surgery and ankle surgery. It has been an immensely stressful time for all of us, but we always come back to your help at our time of need. In addition, Dr. Lay, I cannot say enough about the kindness and care of Mark Harada, my supervisor and friend, who was at my side after the accident and who has been an endless source of support through our difficult times.
Mark Harada has been recognized by Enron for the exceptional individual he is. His potential value to Enron is immeasurable. He is truly the embodiment of what an Enron manager should be. I was saddened to hear his leadership role in EES had been diminished. He is exceptional.
Based on the  surgeries that lay ahead of me, with the accompanying rehabilitation periods, it appears that I will not be returning to EES for several months. That is why I'm writing to you now. This was a long overdue note of thanks.
Lastly, in a conversation with John Boosey, (formerly Enserch), before his death, he asked if I spoke with you, to pass on his regards. John was a mentor to me during my years with Enserch/Ebasco and had been in ill health for some time.
Finally, from my wife, Dr. Gail Holian Pestana and I, thank you again for bringing us home.

Our Best Regards,

Joe and Gail

Ken--

I just wanted to thank you again for inviting me to Houston, and more
importantly, for the support you and Enron are providing to Technology for
All and the joint TFA/SmartForce project.  I believe that we are going to
help make a real difference.

I also wanted to follow up our brief conversation, where we discussed
getting some of our people together with your people at Enron (I believe
that you indicated that your head of HR would be a good start) to see
whether there are ways in which SmartForce can help Enron achieve some of
its business objectives around learning and training.

I would appreciate it if you would have someone email to me the contact
information for whomever it would be appropriate for us to approach.  I'll
take care of the rest from my end.  Thanks again.

Regards,

Greg

"RE: Enron Metals Ltd (Enron Europe Office)","Ken,

This gentleman joined Enron Europe following our acquisition of MG PLC in early 2000. While I think it prudent for us to conduct an independent review (I have asked a member of Cindy's ER team to take a look at this), it does appear to me on first pass that he is essentially unhappy that we are not prepared to pay him 2 years pay in the event he voluntarily terminates his employment with us.

Just for clarity, I do not believe he is being asked to leave the company. In fact, as I understand it,  his extended illness prevents him from being focused on as a redundancy target. In addition, he along with several other Enron Metals employees do have more generous contractual notice periods in their UK employment agreements that do trigger a significantly higher sum in the event of termination than most of our UK employees (up to a years pay).

I will update you further when I have more information.

Dear Mr Lay,

I write to you as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Enron
Corporation because I would like you to know that I am on my second period
of sick leave in a year due to work related stress.

A year ago I was apologised to by the Human Resources Department and told
that they would not allow it to happen again.  Through constant pressure and
the unfair way in which I have been treated, the advice of my doctor and
counsellor, as they are concerned with my health, was to accept the
voluntary redundancy which had been offered to my colleagues and myself
recently.

Though due to my exceptional circumstances I wrote the attached letter.

Today I received the attached response and I feel totally devastated that
Enron Europe will not compensate me fairly for how they have affected my
life and that of my family's.

I read in Enron's literature that you care about your employees and their
families, and feel that your code of ethics should have offered me
protection against the circumstances that I find myself in, but to my
complete and utter dismay I find this is not the case and  in my
experience I have suffered a great deal and this seems to have been totally
ignored in the response letter.  I haven't once been contacted by Enron
Europe to see how I'm coping and give me any support whatsoever.  They are
showing no care or concern for me or my family.

I write to you for help in this matter and to conclude this stressful
situation that I find myself in due to your company.

Under the circumstances and increased stress that the response letter has
put upon me, I would be most grateful if you would respond to me as soon as
possible.

Yours sincerely

David Mortimer

As you are aware, Band-X India is representing GLOBAL SWITCH's interest in
your facility in Mumbai.  We have requested your Mumbai team for information
pertaining to the business status - as it will only aid us in finalising a
suitable offer.

I have expressed clearly and at numerous occasions that we are not
competitors (see mail below) - which seems to be why we have not been given
any information / support in processing our interest.

As representatives it is expected that we represent the clients interests in
full - in terms of expression of interest to you (which has been expressed
directly via Global Switch); evaluation of the opportunity and assistance in
formulation of offer.

FYI BSPL is in receipt of NDAs signed by Band-X as well as Global Switch.  I
would appreciate if you could assist in ensuring that we receive the
necessary information at the earliest.

I'm not at all clear where you are with GS - are they planning to put in an

On the marketing side, I am uncomfortable releasing specific information

Band-X are potential direct competitors.

Dear Mr. Lay,

For what it is worth, I believe this move, although very unfortunate given Andy's long service to Enron, is the right thing to do. In the way that Enron has historically been the poster child for corporate innovation, I hope you will now lead us in the direction that makes us the poster child for handling a crisis of investor confidence. Enron is such an amazing company, I trust you will do everything necessary to work cooperatively with the investor community to restore the company to its former greatness.

Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Pop-Pop is Coming to Houston","Dear Family and Friends,

Ken and I have invited my father and his two lady friends (Cathy Hofgren and
Mary Walsh) to visit us at the Huntingdon in Houston for a long weekend.
The visit has been scheduled for late Thursday evening, October 11 until the
afternoon of Monday, October 15.  Unless the horrific events of the past two
weeks and it's aftermath causes some unforeseen problem, we will move
forward with their visit.  Pop-Pop is anxious to ""catch up"" and see everyone
in the family and some of our friends; he particularly wants to see his
precious great grand children.  Considering his age and the difficulty in
the logistics for him to see everyone, we are planning one big ""extended""
family/friends casual dinner for Friday, October 12 @5:30 p.m. in the Pool
Room @River Oaks Country Club.  Mark your calendars and hopefully, most of
you will be available to join us.

I am aware of two noteworthy events in October; the first is Sharon Lay's
birthday on October 8th and the second is Halloween.  Therefore, if Sharon
is able to attend, we will have a Halloween birthday party.  With Halloween
as our theme, we will have ""FRIENDLY"" costumes for all children attending
and games to play.

Jessica will be e-mailing you with a guest list and getting a definite head
count, as we get closer to Pop-Pop's arrival.  If any of you have other
family members or friends who would enjoy seeing Pop-Pop and/or celebrating
Sharon's birthday and you would like for them to join us, please let me
know.

Lots of Love, Mom/Linda

"I was unable to submit my question via eSpeak","I tried to submit my question via eSpeak however I received the following message ""The system was unable to process your request.  The information you submitted may be in error.""  Since I was unable to submit my question via eSpeak I thought I'd send my question to you directly.  

I'd like to begin by welcoming you back.  Although Enron has some experienced difficult times during the past year I know that you will help lead us and obtain our goal of being the world's leading company.  

Secondly, I wanted to bring to your attention a matter that concerns me a great deal.  A close personal friend of mine who works at Enron and lives in an outlying area of Houston has been commuting to work in what I would consider a risky manner.  What she does and from what I understand its a common practice among Enron employees as well as others who work downtown is pick up riders from the park & ride lots so that she can get on the HOV lane.  People from what I understand literally line up and cars drive up and pick up passengers.  It goes without saying that the majority of the time the drivers do not know who they are picking up or vice-versa.  This is the part that concerns me.  I'm sure that most of the people that do this are good people and have no bad intentions and are simply trying to save time and maybe even get a little extra sleep.   However, what concerns me is eventually I think someone who has bad intentions will come along and I don't want anything to happen to my friend or anyone else for that matter.  I'd like to see if there is something that Enron can do so that our co-workers, friends, and loved ones can commute to downtown in a manner that isn't so risky.  I have told my friend that this isn't a safe practice but unfortunately it has fallen on deaf ears and would at least like to try an come up with an alternative for her.  

The only alternative I could come up with is if Enron formed a voluntary list of Enron employees who live in the same area and commute to downtown in this manner so that they can car-pool in together.  I know some people might say that this isn't an Enron issue but I think it is because several Enron employees commute to downtown in this manner.  

This months tragic events made me realize that sometimes we place too much of an emphasis on things that really don't matter and to focus on the things that do.  I just want to try and make sure that nothing happens to my friend.  Thank you for your time and once again welcome back.  

Thanks.
Richard

From:   Ronnie Chan                 (fax: 719-632-4180) 
Dear Ken, 
My flight this morning from Singapore arrived Hong Kong at 1:40am local time.  Upon deplaning, I called Kelly Johnson but could not join the board meeting because I was unable to find a fixed line.  I phoned Paula Rieker after getting home to receive an update of the meeting.  Apparently the session ended right at the time I rang Kelly.  
Two thoughts: to bring in either as a director or as an advisor a highly reputable financial person such as Bob Rubin is a good idea.  If Bob (whom I saw last Friday in Shanghai) cannot do it, you may consider Felix Rohatyn.  He was of course the person in 1975 who bailed out the financial crisis of New York City.  Until recently, he was U.S. Ambassador to France.  I know him personally but not well.  However, another friend Peter Goldmark who is chairman, CEO and publisher of the International Herald Tribune knows Felix very well.  Peter told me that he was excellent in crisis situations.  Together with his financial savvy and reputation, maybe he can be considered by Enron at this time.  Coincidentally, Peter was head of the New York Port Authority in the late 70's and early 80's.
At the October 24 board meeting, you told us about Jeff Skilling's phone call right beforehand.  Could it be that knowing that the board would not invite him back, he was offering himself just to give the impression of not having left us in anticipation of the present problems?  If so, then we should not turn him down right away.  Perhaps we should somehow make him not want to come back.  Maybe this is too convoluted.  
Ken, these are difficult times but I am pleased that the board is acting in unison.  After the problems are over, I still think that my suggestion to you during the last board dinner in Houston should be looked into, i.e. have a strategy retreat where the board can have thorough discussions on the many fundamental aspects of our business.  Present difficulties only point to that need.  But for now, let us get over the immediate hurdle first.  
Sincerely, 
Ronnie Chan 
P.S.    Since I have spoken to Norm about the strategy retreat, I am copying this letter to him.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Now it is the time to cut cost.","Ken,

I am not a smart man. However I saw enron stock reached $26, I worry one thing.

Under current situation it is difficult to make more money. How could we boost stock price?

Enron hired enough people already. It is the time to cut cost, freeze hiring new people now.

Freezing hire is much more better than lay off in a near future.

Thanks.

"Hi!","
Dear Uncle Ken and Aunt Linda,
 
Hi! I'm so sorry for what is all that's happening to ya'll.  I hope God will help ya'll in so mnay ways to keep ya'll spirit's up through these rough times.  I pray that God will help you, Uncle Ken through the things your company is going through.  I want to call you so many times, but didn't because I don't want to distract you from your valuable time away from this big problem you are going through.  My Political Science teacher last week said something about Enron, I immediately raised my hand since I was the only one in the class who knew what Enron was and what is kinda happening to it.

"reaction from the credit markets on the earnings call","John thought you might be interested in the following from the credit markets....

Play by play during the call on the 5yr Enron Credit Default Swaps from Morgan Stanley:

1.  5Y BIDS GETTING HIT ON OPENING AS EARNINGS NEWS LOOKED LIKE
    CLEANING HOUSE.  250.
2.  DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL; WHICH APPARENTLY WAS UNCLEAR,
    TICKED OUT 255,260,265.
3.  LAY INDICATED NEAR END OF CONFERENCE ""NO RATINGS ACTION
    ANTICIPATED"".   MINUTE CONFERENCE ENDED MOODY'S WATCH NEWS
    RELEASED.  280 BID.
4.  LAY ALSO MENTIONED 3Q NEG CASH FLOW DUE TO SOME CONTRACT
    ROLLOFF.  UNCLEAR MESSSAGE.
5.  ENE SAYS COMMITTED TO ""INV GRADE"" RATHER THAN ""A""  280/325


Summary from Morgan Stanley after the call:

CREDIT DERIVATIVE UPDATE:  ENRON CORP

AFTER THE NEWS THIS AM ($1 BIL. CHARGE), THE COMPANY HOSTED A
CALL AT 10AM NY TIME.   THE CALL DID NOT GO WELL & ENRON SPREADS
ARE HEADING WIDER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE LAND.  MKTS ARE SPOOKED
B/C:  1) MOODY'S WATCHLISTED CO NEGATIVE, 2) ENE STATED ""THEY
ARE COMMITED TO INVESTMENT GRADE RATING,"" WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM
THE SINGLE-A BOGEY THEY ONCE EXTOLED, 3) CO. DID NOT ADDRESS ALL
LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND 4) MORE CHARGES COMING?
5YR MARKETS:

      ENE (PRE-WTC):   165/185        ENE (8AM TODAY): 240/260
      ENE (WEEK AGO):  250/300      **ENE NOW:         275/350

Clearly the above are a function of what people think they heard...I did not alter any of the email.  In general MSDW likes Enron credit but this is how they see the market.  Enron is one of the most actively traded names in the credit derivative market.  Let me know if you want updates as the market gets more clarity and works throught the details

"Message from the front lines","Hi Ken,
I usually don't write email to heads of large corporations, and I don't even know you, but you have been on my mind for a while now.  I just want you to know that you are doing a great job.  You took a lot of blows at the employee meeting last week, and you did a great job defending Enron, defending yourself and defending your values.  You built this company, and you can do it again if you need to.  The events of the last few months and weeks must be weighing heavily on your heart.  Greed whispers to all of us, and I am thankful for being able to see and experience its devastating effects on individuals, families and organizations.  One day, I will own my own business, and the lessons I am learning at present are invaluable.  I also want you to know that there are lots of people who believe that this company still has what it takes to succeed, and also believe that you are the guy to lead us.

My thoughts and prayers are with you,
Jennifer Richard

"Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project","
The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous ""Home Video"" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, ""Enny"" will also be awarded for ""Best Overall Video.""

If you have any questions about the ""Home Video"" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

"FW: Dabhol Washington Update 2","
	The results of the PM's visit to Washington and, with it, the opportunity for a dialogue between the two governments on Dabhol were disappointing, to say the least.
	As the PM was arriving White House lawyers made a determination that neither the President nor Larry Lindsey could speak to the Dabhol situation.  It was decided that Condi Rice would raise the issue with Mishra when they met on Thursday but she unfortunately did not.  The GOI apparently raised Dabhol in the Lindsey meeting but all he could do was hear them out and then explain that he could not discuss the issue.  Great impression!
	The PMO Secretary refused to meet with me once he learned no one from Houston could come up.
	OPIC is furious about the outcome.  OPIC leadership knows the project is about to be dropped in their lap.  We will be meeting in the next several days as they are travelling but I have already broached the idea that OPIC should approve a move to termination preemptively.  They understand where we are coming from but preliminarily are looking at a trip to India to meet with the GOI and explain what lies before them.  We also discussed their need to get clarification from the NSC as to where Dabhol stands in their list of priorities.  OPIC has to bring along the other parts of the Administration and it is unclear where they stand in light of the past week. Once Larson is back from Doha we will meet and sort out where State is on pressing the issue.
	All in all a good opportunity lost. Standard fare for a terrible week.  ohn

Subject:	Dabhol Washington Update 


	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening:

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week.  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:
	1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.
	2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.

	At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.
	Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.

	Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

"World Economic Forum, Energy Governors Meeting","Dear Jenny,

I refer to our phone conversation of today 12.10.01.

As Dr Lay has registered for our Energy Governors Meeting in Davos I sent
him an invitation to the Preparatory Meeting. The purpose of the
Preparatory Meeting is to brainstorm on possible topics and discussion
leaders for the programme of the Governors Meeting for Energy which will
take place from 3 to 5 February 2002, and to identify the latest trends in
the industry.

In order to prepare a successful Governors Meeting, the issue selection is
primordial. I am pleased that among the first confirmations for the
Preparatory Meeting we received confirmations from ABB Ltd, ENI SPA, Royal
Dutch/Shell, Statoil Group, Ruhrgas, EDF, Duke Energy Corporation, Engen
Petroleum Ltd, Gaz de France, some of which will be represented by their
top-executives.

As it is impossible for Dr Lay to participate at the Preparatory Meeting,
we would be most grateful if you could nominate a delegate as well as send
us his preliminary ideas on interesting issues and panellists for the
programme. Of course, I am fully aware what a long way it is to go for a
one-day meeting from Houston to Geneva.

This Preparatory Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday 6 November from 08.30 to
16.00 and will be held at World Economic Forum Headquarters in Cologny. We
would also like to invite this person to an informal dinner on the previous
evening, Monday 5 November at 19.30, at the Hotel Beau-Rivage in Geneva (13
quai du Mont-Blanc, 1201 Geneva, Tel. 41 22/716 6666).

Please find enclosed some suggested topics for your consideration.

(See attached file: issues.doc)

Should you have any questions concerning the Governors Meeting, please do
not hesitate to contact me any time.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
Christoph Frei

"Speaking Invitation","Dear Mr Lay

Eyeforenergy Asia 2001 takes place at the Shangri La Hotel in Singapore,
15-17 October.  It is the follow-up to last year's e-Business for Energy
Asia Pacific, which also took place in Singapore, and will be the
meeting-place this year for the senior energy executives in the region to
discuss all the latest developments in the industry - e-business, regulatory
change, and the subsequent financial impact on both the new and old
economies.

I would like to invite you to give a keynote presentation at the conference.
I have attached the full program.

We expect 150 very senior delegates from across the energy industry, from
Asia and beyond - oil and gas co's, but also electricity utilities, as well
as exchanges, analysts and investors.  Speakers will come from companies
such as Caltex, BP, Shell, Petronas, Premier and Texaco, and, hopefully,
Enron.

If you have any questions at all, or would like to discuss your presentation
in more detail, please do not hesitate to give me a call or drop me an
email.

"","RE:	Bankruptcy for Enron?

If you and rest of Enron are going to declare bankruptcy, you MUST do
the following:

1. LAY OFF OR RETIRE AS MANY ENRON EMPLOYEES AS POSSIBLE TO CONVINCE
WALL STREET THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS!
2. FIRE/RETIRE AS MANY HIGHLY PAID EXECUTIVES AS POSSIBLE!
3. CALL RICK RICHARD OF COLUMBIA AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT HOW HE MANAGED
COLUMBIA DURING THEIR BANKRUPTCY!  LISTEN AND HEED HIS ADVICE IF HE WILL
GIVE IT TO YOU!
4. CONVINCE THE ENRON BOARD AND EXECUTIVES THAT THEY MUST DO GOOD THINGS
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS! IF YOU THINK THIS IS TOO SIMPLE A DIRECTIVE, YOU
REALLY NEED TO QUIT.
5. ELECT SOME COMPETENT PEOPLE TO ENRON'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND GET RID
OF THE SPINELESS PUPPETS YOU HAVE NOW!

IF YOU ARE AN HONEST PERSON, YOU WILL TAKE MY ADVICE AND ACT UPON IT IN
AN EXPEDITIOUS MANNER!

"Next BoD Meeting","Ken - As you know, we had several issues that needed to get tied down before the BoD reconvenes to review Project Southwood.   Both Jeff McMahon (deal timing) and Rick Causey (goodwill) are ready.  Andy Fastow expects to have a read from the agencies very soon (likely late today).  As soon as I hear from Andy, I will begin polling and will set the date, hopefully, for early next week.  At this time, I am not aware of any additional items that need to be addressed by the Board in the upcoming meeting.  We need to confirm the 2002 BoD calendar but can do that in the regularly scheduled meeting in Dec.  Thanks, Paula

"Prayer Journal 12/6/01","
12/6/01: Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth! You are so incredibly good to Mr. Lay!! Look at what you gave us today!!! Colossians and 1 Thessalonians. What an encourager You are Lord!! Who can know You!!!??? Your ways are certainly NOT our ways! Thank you, Jesus!!!
Ok, Lord, this is what is in my heart today for them. 
Lord, just like you gave Noah a rainbow (from the throne room of God, by the way!)-I am asking You to give them an assurance that this kind of disciplining will not happen again. Yes, Lord, they need to trust in You. I know that but every time the stock goes down they will panic. So, I guess first of all, they need grace to put their trust in YOU but remembering that we are dumb sheep, please do something in their hearts to not go into panic every time the stock goes nuts. I guess what I am asking is for You to supernaturally restore confidence in the leadership of Enron. Give them supernatural favor in the hearts of the people. BUT You must also command Your Word in the hearts of the leadership. Let them NEVER get into this kind of mess again. 
You tell us to look well to the state of our flocks (Prov 27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.)
Thank you, Lord, that YOU bear such wonderful witness of your child, Ken Lay. Make him see that Your heart is so good towards him. Make him see, Lord. We need to know that our Father is on our side. We come into agreement with you that YOU ALONE are GOD. AND we ask your forgiveness for our being seduced by ""foreign gods"" (things of this world since we are children of the KINGDOM OF GOD) and THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR GRACE!!!!!!!!!
We love you, Jesus. We love you so. Thank you that you delight in us! How can this be? You say so in Your Word. For the first time, I really do want to get there soon! Why would I hang onto the things of this world when I can experience Your Love FOREVER! You will make us blush with Your gaze of love upon us. Oh God, give us MORE of the Holy Spirit that we may bear MUCH FRUIT!!!
Back to requests, Lord, give Mr. Lay (and those he delegates authority to) supernatural discernment so that they may ""hear the abundance of rain""!!! I LOVE THAT VERSE, LORD!!! 
Thank you that you are more powerful and that we DO NOT need to FEAR ANYTHING! If God is for us, who can be against us!!! AMEN and AMEN!!
Oh, by the way, Lord. Thank you for showing how You are gathering your ""scattered sheep"" you showed us yesterday! Enron field!!! Thank you, Lord. Lord, don't let that name die-ok? It is good. Restore it! Rebuild on the wastes like you talk about in Isaiah!
Still another thing. Thank you that you truly are about GRACE. Give us supernatural understanding of that. In Jesus name, our mighty warrior! Prince of Peace, Lord of Lords!

"Our Wonderful Company","Dear Mr. Lay,

I know that you are a very busy man and really don't have time to read messages from your employees, but I just had to write you of my thought and feelings.

I haven't been sleeping very well because I am heartbroken at what is happening to this wonderful company.  I really try to be positive about the outcome of it all, but the news seem to get worse and worse.  I am so worried about all of the lives that are being affected and what it's going to mean to all of us in the coming months. Also, as someone who only has a few years left before retirement, I am faced with the possibility that I will not have any supplemental retirement to help me live in a decent environment.  

I love Enron and all that it has made it great and will continue to work hard to make a contribution to its success.  However, I realize that it ultimately is up to you and your team to successfully resolve all the issues facing our company.   I have the faith that you can do that.

Mr. Lay, please allow me to be bold and ask you to  remember that ""God is Always in Control"" and he will help if only we ask him to.

Thank you so much for your time.

Ken,
Thank you for your email encouraging me to report to work today.  Unfortunately I am an employee of Enron Europe thus have already been fired.  The oversight that I  beleive PriceWaterhouseCoopers made in terminating my employment relates to the fact that, while I have created and managed a very successful portfolio of weather derivatives in the London office with a positive mark-to market, all trades were booked through ECTRIC and EFET which fall under Enron Corp.  My salary (and the salaries of my staff) are paid - and therefore the expense incurred- by EEL.  The oversight is that PwC should have recognized that I could have acted as agent for EEL and run off the portfolio thereby realizing positive cash to satisfy creditors of EEL.  It is too bad that we have administrators in London trying to handle a process of which they know absolutely nothing about.  Potential recovery for creditors -ignored. 
 
Thank you

"University of Houston & Energy Marketing Institute","
	Greetings, my name is Rodney Derbigny and I am in the Associate / Analyst program here at Enron.  I'm writing because yesterday I attended the University of Houston 2001 Bauer College of Business Scholarship Dinner and I was surprised by the non-representation or presence of Enron at the banquet other than myself.  I graduated from the University of Houston with a BBA in MIS this past May and I'm curious to know why Enron is not more involved with U of H.  I know Enron is vastly involved in the community and institutions of higher learning, but I want to know if we can put a little more effort into relationship our with U of H.  Being that a large number of employees within this corporation have an affiliation or graduated from this fine university, I believe we would only be limiting ourselves and failing to capture the vast abundance of talent that attends this school.  

	Last night and at the career fair last week, I had the pleasure of meeting Dean Arthur Warga, Assistant Dean Bob Casey, and Associate Vice Chancellor Spencer Yantis.  These gentlemen informed me of the College of Business's new endeavors and direction, especially the Energy Marketing Institute.  I was informed that a presentation has been made to Enron regarding the Energy Marketing Institute, but the progress of the relationship is still on hold.  I respectfully request that Enron begin taking this opportunity into a serious consideration because of the vast opportunities it will provide for this company and the University.  At the banquet, a number of our current industry competitors were represented and have either become involved or voiced an intense desire to take advantage of the program.  Namely, Dynegy, Duke Energy, El Paso Energy, ExxonMobil, and BP Amoco were represented at the banquet.  With the name recognition Enron possess within the city of Houston and the desire it fuels within the hearts of students to become a part of the Enron team, it is unfortunate that we are not as involved as we could be.  Enron is doing a great multitude of excellent things, but I believe we can become better and do more.  If we are truly seeking to become the World's Leading company, we must capitalize off opportunities as such.  The Energy Marketing Institute at the Bauer College of Business will fuel and drive our future by preparing students to enter into the business in which we have made our mark and redefined the standards, Energy Marketing.

	As a UH Alumnus, I want to encourage Enron's relationship development activities with UH.  I truly hope we take advantage of the vast number of talented students U of H is preparing and become more heavily involved building an enduring relationship with this University, outside of just simple recruiting at a Career Fair.  There are numerous opportunities awaiting to be captured at UH, but if we do not realize this, the talent that is eagerly waiting to become a part of the Enron team will go elsewhere. The academic program at U of H is not only what makes it a fine institution, but the fact that U of H possesses a student body that is reflective of Enron itself.  The diversity of the university develops students who are culturally aware, understand the meaning of dedication and commitment (most students work and attend school), and who are fueled by an innovative, entrepreneurial mindset; all of the elements upon which we focus.    We need to take advantage of the access we have to U of H and position ourselves for the future by grasping hold of the students and opportunities at U of H.  Students graduate from the Bauer College of Business well-rounded, prepared to enter any arena of the workplace; from Marketing and Management to Information Technology and Finance, and ready to assume roles as the future executives and leaders of tomorrow.

	If there is anything I can do to assist in strengthening the relationships between Enron and my Alma Mata or demonstrating the importance of this need, please let me know.  I trust these words will not be viewed as offensive or taken lightly, but that they inspire change.  Enron can truly make a profound impact on the campus of the University of Houston, aid in the career advancement of new graduates, receive recognition in the community, and position itself to truly become the World's Leading company.  

	I hope I can be a part of the efforts to build the relationship with U of H and make the vision Enron has become a reality.  Thank you and take care.

Respectfully,

"RE:  reaction from the credit markets on the earnings call","As we have discussed at the Board level as well as in Management Commitee, the default swap market is extremely illiquid.  While it is true that ENE is one of the most liquid names in the market, the entire market would move based on an order of $40 to $50 MM.  We have heard that there have been standing sell orders in the market totalling approximately $150 MM which have yet to be absorbed, it could be that the prices moved significantly in order for those sellers to find a buyer.

While this market is an important datapoint in evaluating the credit markets view of our name, it is not the sole determinant.  It is important to note that secondary trading levels of our bonds (a far more liquid market and accurate indicator of our ability to raise incremental capital) have only widened 5 - 10 basis points over the course of the day. 

While I would very much like to tighten the spreads in the default swap market, I think that we need to keep those price markers  in perspective.  Having said that, anything we can do to support the credit and tighten those prices ultimately helps in our ability to raise debt in all markets.

John thought you might be interested in the following from the credit markets....

Play by play during the call on the 5yr Enron Credit Default Swaps from Morgan Stanley:

1.  5Y BIDS GETTING HIT ON OPENING AS EARNINGS NEWS LOOKED LIKE
    CLEANING HOUSE.  250.
2.  DURING THE CONFERENCE CALL; WHICH APPARENTLY WAS UNCLEAR,
    TICKED OUT 255,260,265.
3.  LAY INDICATED NEAR END OF CONFERENCE ""NO RATINGS ACTION
    ANTICIPATED"".   MINUTE CONFERENCE ENDED MOODY'S WATCH NEWS
    RELEASED.  280 BID.
4.  LAY ALSO MENTIONED 3Q NEG CASH FLOW DUE TO SOME CONTRACT
    ROLLOFF.  UNCLEAR MESSSAGE.
5.  ENE SAYS COMMITTED TO ""INV GRADE"" RATHER THAN ""A""  280/325


Summary from Morgan Stanley after the call:

CREDIT DERIVATIVE UPDATE:  ENRON CORP

AFTER THE NEWS THIS AM ($1 BIL. CHARGE), THE COMPANY HOSTED A
CALL AT 10AM NY TIME.   THE CALL DID NOT GO WELL & ENRON SPREADS
ARE HEADING WIDER IN CREDIT DERIVATIVE LAND.  MKTS ARE SPOOKED
B/C:  1) MOODY'S WATCHLISTED CO NEGATIVE, 2) ENE STATED ""THEY
ARE COMMITED TO INVESTMENT GRADE RATING,"" WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM
THE SINGLE-A BOGEY THEY ONCE EXTOLED, 3) CO. DID NOT ADDRESS ALL
LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND 4) MORE CHARGES COMING?
5YR MARKETS:

      ENE (PRE-WTC):   165/185        ENE (8AM TODAY): 240/260
      ENE (WEEK AGO):  250/300      **ENE NOW:         275/350

Clearly the above are a function of what people think they heard...I did not alter any of the email.  In general MSDW likes Enron credit but this is how they see the market.  Enron is one of the most actively traded names in the credit derivative market.  Let me know if you want updates as the market gets more clarity and works throught the details

"FW: Aspen ISIB conference on Balanced Leadership","Dear Ken,

I hope you are faring okay in these difficult times.  At Aspen ISIB, our
work goes forward, albeit with much discussion about how to stay relevant
and to understand the connections between social impact management and
aftermath of September 11th.

I have a request of you.  An example of work that we think has great
relevance is a by-invitation only meeting of about 30 experts in Executive
Education--as practiced by corporations, by universitites and professional
service firms--that we are convening near Washington D.C in November.  It's
a
two day working session, and the title is ""Balanced Leadership During
Turbulence and Crisis: The Role of Executive Education.""  We had planned to
focus more specifically on the economic downturn, but for obvious reasons
have broadened the scope of the discussions.  This work, like the Aspen
Business Leaders Dialogue, builds on two meetings that have preceded this
one, and we benefit from including a mix of ""returnees"" and new
participants.

I am writing to find out if there is someone in your firm that would make a
contributuion to the discussion and would like the opportunity to reflect on
best practice and innovation in executive education and training as we
consider the need for extraordinary leaders in our global enterprises. The
meeting is about the balancing act--profits vs. principles, short vs.
long-term needs, and listening to multiple stakeholders. If you have any
ideas for us, please let me know.  Nancy McGaw, who runs the meeting, or I
will follow up. A one-page description is attached for your convenience. The
Co-Chairs of the meeting are Bill Wiggenhorn, until recently President of
Motorola University, now of Providian Financial, and Gary Jusela, Chief
Learning Officer at Lucent Technologies.

Best regards, Judy

To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Daily Update


Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"Harvard/Enron Multimedia Cases","Hi Ken Louise and Jeff,

Attached are the links to the multimedia cases Harvard prepared in association with the cases recently written, excerpted from the videos they took of the 3 of you a few months ago.

I'm remotely  accessing this while travelling and have been unable to open the videos.  This is likely a function of the remote connection.  

Ken and Jeff, I'll review each of yours when I'm better able to access. I'll then  provide you my comments (if any), as you will need to sign off on the release and use of these by Harvard.

Louise, will you please review at least your portion?

Thanks!

Hi Christie,
I'm happy to send you the links to our two Enron multimedia cases.  The
written part of the cases is exactly the same as their traditional,
hard-copy counterparts; the video clips are taken from the longer Enron
video tapes we had made in January.

I'll be sending you the required paperwork for your sign-off.  (We'll also
need sign-offs from the three case protagonists--Ken, Jeff and Louise.)  In
the meantime, if you could review the cases and pass them on for Ken's,
Jeff's and Louise's approvals, that would be great.

Please feel free to contact me if the video links don't work--I've checked
them on my machine and they seen to work fine, but things sometimes get
distorted in transmission--or if you have any questions.  Thanks for all
your help, and have a great weekend!
Best,
Meg

"","Ken,  I just wanted to say thanks for all that you and Enron have done for me.  I know you trusted people close to you and they let you down for that Im sorry.  I have always believed in you and what you stand for.  I  know it took tremendous courage to do what you have done over the last couple of weeks.  Whether the people at Enron like it or not I believe you put us first.  I trust that your decision was the right thing given the circumstances. Yes, Im deeply hurt by the last month but the true spirit of Enron will last within me forever.   I started at this company a mid level IT Administrator and I am now a seasoned Director level technologist and leader.  I have had 4 promotions in the last 5 1/2 years.  I have been challenged by this environment.  I believe that I can go anywhere and be successful because of meeting those challenges.  No where else could have provided me these opportunities. In return Im going to stay committed and have faith that due to that committment the Enron spirit will live on.  With all the bad I wanted to remind you of the good. My years of employment with Enron have been the best of my career.  No matter what happens I know I will be fine. I truly wish you and your family the best.  

Take Care

"Additional Info for Harry Clark","Ken, it is my understanding the Harry was recommended to us by Irwin Setlzer and is going to talk to our Advisory Committe and maybe the Management Committee at the end of the month in London.( I think that Steve organized this at your request?)  I had breakfast with Harry  in D.C. and  while I don't know a lot about him, I was impressed by some of his initial thoughts and the ""totalilty"" of his thinking as it relates to rebuilding our image and reputation.  

He told me he had spent some time talking with Steve, Mark and Greg in an attempt to prepare his presentation but, as noted below, he would like to have some additional information.  I want to be careful here as I am not officially involved and I do not think Steve knows I met Harry, therefore I thought I should check with you before sharing  our internal survey with him, or the external ""image"" study. 

Again, only a first impression, but he may be able to  fill a role for us that I suggested to you that Shelly Lazarus might, in terms of educating our folks on what makes up a company's image and why it matters. Please let me know how you would like me to handle this.  Thank-you, Beth

Beth,

   Delighted to spend some time with you in Arlington earlier today.
Your insights and historical perspective are invaluable.   I certainly
hope we'll have other opportunities to jointly figure out how to get the
Enron engine again running on all cylinders...and to get the mechanics all
working together!

   You mentioned some recently completed employee research which has
resulted, initially, in some performance review process changes at the
company.   I'd appreciate having a look at the research findings and
anything else you think might inform my thinking about the evolution of
the company's reputation among any  of its constituencies.   Feel free to
e-mail, fax or mail.

   Please call if you have any other observations or suggestions that
might make my London discussions at the end of the month more fruitful.
Many thanks.

"Precious man of God.","
Mr. Lay, 
I am a former employee of Enron and have been through many trials in the past few years. God has been faithful and seen me through them all. Dear sir, I can tell you that I can count it all joy. I just want to encourage you. These look like very dark times right now. Call upon the name of the Lord. Throw yourself on the mercy and grace of the Lord and remember all that he has done. He is a BIG, GOOD God that LOVES you! His arm hasn't been shortened that He cannot help you. 
You will be glad to know that the true testimony of you as a man is of a good report. You will glorify God in this. I am listening to a song right this minute that I so wish you could hear. It would bring you such comfort. It is based on the verse that talks about ""all of my help cometh from the Lord"". How true that is for you. 
Lord Jesus, you are a good God that sees all things. Mr. Lay is a man of God. That means he is your child. You tell us that you are an ever present help in time of trouble. These troubles are over his head but under your feet. Lord Jesus, show yourself strong on his behalf. Glorify yourself and Mr. Lay will give you the glory. He knows, Lord. Help him in this time when the waters are flowing over his head. Hear him from where you are. We are all but dust. Who are we that you are mindful of us but you tell us in your Word that You have good thoughts and plans for us and they are for good and NOT EVIL that we may have an expected end. (Jer 29:11-For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.) Who can stand except you give us grace? Lord, you are so good. Remind Mr. Lay of who you really are. In the mighty name of Jesus!

Mr. Lay, get some scripture to hang onto-write it down on a card and carry it with you. When things come against you (the enemy), you will need to remember who you are in Jesus! The greatest battle on earth was fought with the Word of God (Satan against Jesus in the wilderness)!
Isaiah 54:17-No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
Oh Mr. Lay, one more thing. I am telling you that I haven't a clue as to what has or has not been done. I just want to show you something from the Word of God how God is. If you will read Isaiah's calling in Isaiah 6 and read Moses' calling in Exodus 3, you will see that God DOES NOT mention their sin to them. Isaiah was just overcome with the glory of God and confessed all by himself and Moses (remember he had killed an Egyptian) was just trying to convince God that He had to be wrong. The ONLY reason I mention it is because sometimes we delay in going to God because we think we have done something wrong. God tells us that He hasn't dealt with us according to our sins. KNOW that NO MATTER WHAT, Jesus is ready to fight on your behalf! It is ALWAYS about God's SPIRIT and not our strength. 
When I started this email, you were just a stranger. You are now my beloved brother in Christ. Isn't it amazing how God works. He has knit my heart to yours. I will be on my knees for you. Phillipians tells us to pray for E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G! What does everything mean? EVERYTHING! God's gonna do some amazing stuff so get ready!!!! His ways aren't our ways and remember too-He is able to do EXCEEDINGLY ABOVE what we can ask or think!

"HOLIDAY VENDOR CHOICE","Dr. Lay -

The decision to go with Planners Services Group versus Extraordinary Events, TBA Inc., or Ward & Ames was made by the ONE ENRON Holiday Party Planning Committee.  (Planners has an established relationship with Enron Field and coordinated ECT's Holiday party there last year.) Each vendor gave creative presentations and were very similar in capabilities.  While Ward & Ames provided sound ideas in their proposal, there were a few aspects that affected the final decision.  Ward and Ames' proposal was over budget when calibrated against other bids, holds an internal perception of being ""controlling"" vs flexible (i.e. logo launch & Portland adopted elephant event) and presentation was satisfactory but not outstanding when compared to others. Overall each of the vendors would have been capable of handling the event, but in the end Planners was unanimously selected by the Planning Committee.

"Enron Kids","
 
 
I previously sent you an email regarding Enron Kids.  What is the status?  I found a job starting after the first of the year, and I would like to put my son back in Enron Kids.  Is there any possibility that the rate will be reduced?  I was paying $560 before with a subsidy from Enron.  The job I accepted does not pay as much as I was making at Enron.  My son and I both loved Enron Kids and the teachers and I would really not have to start him over in another daycare, if possible.
 
Thank you for your consideration.

"Competitive Analysis Update #24- US Response to Terrorism","Updates below on Afghanistan campaign, key issues for energy/financial markets in ""phase two""of campaign, Federal Reserve activity, and nuclear plant security.  

RJ

Special Forces/Low Intensity Campaign Underway

Sources agree that the U.S. military operation in Afghanistan has begun.  Indications of special forces activity were strongly signaled when Taliban forces shot down a U.S. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on Monday.  The UAV that was shot down, a Predator, has a range of less than 400 miles, suggesting that U.S. special forces are closing in on Afghanistan.

Special forces units are concentrating on intelligence gathering and targeting key bin Ladin installations, as well as attempting to locate bin Ladin himself. As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld noted yesterday, ""there will not be a D-Day as such.""  The Afghanistan campaign at least initially will not be like Desert Storm, where CNN cameras in Baghdad hotels offered real-time imagery of U.S. air strikes.  The first phases of this war are being fought largely in secret, punctuated intermittently by what little coverage the media can provide. The action in phase one includes night raids, a lot of small-scale special operations reconnaissance and, when necessary, direct contact raids. A large military strike using airpower is also forthcoming, but is unlikely to be reported in real-time.

Operational Security is Tight 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said U.S. military officials will refuse to comment on anything that will endanger troops or operations.  ""And anyone that does talk to any of you about that is breaking federal criminal law and should be in jail,"" Rumsfeld said. When asked if he would lie to the press to disguise U.S. military operations, Rumsfeld said ""you never say never.""
Next Phases of U.S. Campaign More Important to Markets
If US military action is limited to Afghanistan, any immediate spike in oil prices is unlikely to endure because such a limited attack will not directly impact oil supply. However, US officials have said that the war on terrorism will go far beyond Afghanistan, so markets will continue to exhibit some degree of uncertainty until further developments take place. 

In the short term, oil supplies would be most directly affected by strikes against Iraq.  But any spike might be short lived as OPEC has enough spare capacity to cover an Iraqi outage.  In the medium term, oil markets might express fears over regional stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions as a result of US military strikes and possible subsequent terrorist attacks.  

It is expected that Iraqi biological-chemical weaponry will receive considerable attention in the days ahead and as has been widely reported, there is a split in the Bush Administration over whether to include Iraq.  The Iraqi weapons of mass destruction capability is likely to once again complicate the rollover of the UN oil-for-food program in December, which could lead to the Iraqis removing their oil from the market independently of what is happening in Afghanistan.  Another key issue is whether the expected refugee crisis and rising Islamic radicalism will destabilize the nuclear-armed Pakistani government. 
 
Saudis Showing Increased Cooperation in Oil Policy and in Military Planning
After a brief furor when the Saudi government announced that the U.S. would not be able to expand its operations at the Prince Sultan Airbase near Riyahd, US-Saudi cooperation has improved.  The public announcement of the airbase prohibition had been a PR move by the Saudis to head off domestic accusations of handing blank checks to the USA. CENTCOM has subsequently transferred its Ops Command to Saudi Arabia.  In addition, the Saudis have responded to U.S. pressure by officially severing relations with the Taliban.

In Vienna, all indications are that the Saudis are working toward an OPEC agreement to keep the market well supplied with oil and to not take advantage of the political uncertainty affecting the crude markets by cutting production.  The most likely outcome is that OPEC will officially hold production at current levels, but agree to limited cheating to ensure adequate supply. Another possibility is that OPEC will lower the target range for the OPEC basket price that would take lower demand forecasts into account.  Either step would allow OPEC to preserve cohesion at a time of political and economic uncertainty.  If prices continue a rapid decline after the Vienna meeting, Washington and Riyadh might come up with a ""politically correct"" way to ""spin"" an output reduction by blaming market volatility on speculators rather than on OPEC.  The cartel is likely to reconvene in early November to reassess market conditions.

Fed Shifts Its Model To Adapt to New Economic Reality

The Fed is still struggling to answers for what recent events will do to the economy but it's clear that three elements of their model have fundamentally changed:

1. The most important is a significant drop in all aspects of individuals' and companies' risk tolerance, which must be reversed quickly. The Fed has done its bit by stabilizing the financial system and Congress is stepping in with a total stimulus package of $100-150 billion (Greenspan supports $100
bln). On the diplomatic/military side, the balanced, multilateral approach of the administration together with discreet pressure on OPEC to reduce prices is all designed to stabilize expectations and boost sentiment. 

2. On rates, while the Fed is expected to keep cutting (they won't disappoint the market), sources report that Greenspan is actually quite comfortable using liquidity to alter actual Fed Funds rather than changing official rates. However, the Fed governors are increasingly convinced that sentiment really depends on military success and they are even more aware than that they are running out of ammunition on the rate cutting side.

3. Despite Greenspan's protests we are looking at a fiscal boost that will push the budget to at least a 1% of GDP deficit.

Nuclear Plants Under Increased Security Scrutiny
The Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute and the Los Angeles-based Committee to Bridge the Gap urged the government to immediately station 30 to 40 National Guard troops around nuclear plants to protect them from attacks.  The watchdog groups also said the government should be prepared to deploy anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down attack planes. Another needed measure is to carefully re-check the background of all nuclear plant employees and contractors to prevent internal sabotage.

"Thanks for the call yesterday!","Ken

Just wanted to thank you for the call yesterday and
for staying in touch during this tumultuous period.

My remaining time at Enron is limited but I wanted to personally
tell you what an honor it has to work with and
learn from you during my seven plus years with the firm.
You created something very special and most of us who were there
know that the benefits to the economy and to people's
lives will surely outweigh the negatives of recent times.

But the most important think I have learned from you is
""grace under fire"".  You always kept your calm; you always
were there to take problems on one at a time, and you never
stopped giving your best.  Thanks for the important lesson!
I am so pleased to have had the chance to be a part of it all.

"Half truths","Mr. Lay

We are getting blasted in the news and a lot of the information is false. There is NO one there to tell the complete truth.  Americans are getting the news that the media wants them to hear and it is not the full truth. Don't we need a spokesman to counter the lies? 

In the end even if there were no wrong doing, it won't matter because the media (and politicians) have said the same lies over and over and finally Americans believe it no matter if it is the truth or not. Day after day they have people on who say, ""I heard that Enron has fired 20,000 employees"".  They never have someone on that really knows.  And, ""Enron benefited from 17 provisions in this law"".  WELL - - so did Dynegy, and Williams and El Paso and on and on.  And, ""Enron only paid taxes one out of five years"".  WELL - - how many large companies did the same?  And, ""Ken Lay called O'Neil"".  WELL - - how many CEO's of large companies called him?  No one is there to represent Enron.  Enron has done things wrong, but it doesn't help if no one is there to stop the half truths and flat out lies. 

Please allow someone who has the knowledge and skills to go on TV and tell both sides. 
Thanks. Cecil

"MESSAGE FROM AMBASSADOR WISNER","October 18, 2001

Dear Ken,

Ratan Tata, who attended Hank Greenberg's October 18 International Advisory
Board meeting, and I talked on the margins about the Enron dispute.  Ratan
confirmed that Tata is interested in helping with a solution, provided that
Indian government and the banks step in, deal with the equity and hold the
investment while Tata works out acquisition details.

Tata also confirmed that he has been approached by the Prime Minister's
office and Tarun Das but the sticking points will include equity price,
costs, etc.  Ratan knows his negotiation is not with Enron.  He agreed with
me that you and he have shared interests in a settlement and that if you
wish an informal conversation with him to ensure he and Enron are on the
same page, he is open to a phone call or a meeting at a place and time
convenient.

In the event that such a conversation would not cross your wires, it seemed
to me that if Tata and Enron are driving for a settlement from different
directions, your interests would be served.  I am sensitive to the fact that
I am ""out of the loop"" and hope that my suggestion that you and Ratan talk
does not complicate matters.

Should you wish to speak with Ratan, his number in Bombay is 011 91 22 204
9131 or 3725.  He leaves New York for Boston today and from there, he
returns to India.

Regards,

Frank

"Prayer for you","Dear Ken and Linda,
I just want you to know William and I have been praying for you.  I know your hearts so I don't look at the circumstances and neither does God.  It doesn't depend on the circumstances, the strength of your arm or your voice.  I hope you find this encouraging and uplifting.  
I wanted to share some verses with you both and some things that Oswald Chambers says in his book His Utmost for His Highest.  ""My eager desire and hope being that I may never feel ashamed, but that now as ever I may do honour to Christ in my own person by fearless courage."" Phil. 1:20  
""We shall all feel ashamed if we do not yield to Jesus on the point He asked us to yield to Him.  To get there is a question of will, not of debate nor of reasoning, but a surrender of will, an absolute and irrevocable surrender on that point.  An over-weaning consideration for ourselves is the thing that keeps us from that decison, though we put it that we are considering others.  When we consider what it will cost others if we obey the call of Jesus, we tell God He does not know what our obedience will mean.  Keep to the point;  He does know.  Shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only- My Utmost for His Highest.  I am determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone. Whether that means life or death, no matter.  Paul is determined that nothing shall deter him from doing exactly what God wants.  God's order has to work up to a crisis in our lives because we will not ! heed the gentler way.   He brings us to the place where He askes us to be our utmost for Him, and we begin to debate; then He produces a providential crisis where we have to decide- for or against, and from that point the ""Great Divide"" begins.  If the crisis has come to you on any line, surrender your will to Him absolutely and irrevocably.  What do you expect to do?  You do not know what you are going to do; the only thing you know is that God knows what He is doing.  Trust Him entirely.  You may not know what He will do next, but you have to trust He does.  We need to come in close contact with the teachings of Jesus Christ.  If we have never had the experience of taking our commonplace religious shoes off our commonplace religious feet, and getting rid of all the undue familiarity with which we approach God it is questionable whether we have ever stood in His presence.""
God bless you during this time.  We will continue to pray for God's will in your lives.
Sincerely,
Barbara T. Collins.

I just wanted you to know that there are still many of us who believe that you are a man of integrity who deserves respect.  Many people gossip and publish terrible misinformation about you and this company.  That only serves to convince me that they are not to be believed.  I understand that you cannot share everything you may want to, or even defend yourself at this time, so please remember that the truth is always the truth and it will prevail.

"We do not want our baby to Die- What can we do to keep Enron Alive","Mr. Lay:

For most of Enron employees, November 9th will go down as one of the most tragic days of our lives. We are not ready to give up on Enron and have its name disappear from the world. On a personal level, I can handle the financial loss as I invested everything(including my 401k) into Enron because I believed in it. I will now be working till I die which I do not mind. What I mind the most is to have Enron's name diappear.  Please tell us if there is anything we can do to keep our baby alive. I am willing to sacrifice whatever I have for this.

Subject:	May God Bless you and your family- We are with you

Mr. Lay:

In view of the events of past weeks surrounding Enron's stock, I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you. I will try to keep this brief. First of all, I want to say that  you are doing a terrific job. With your leadership we will turn this around soon. May God bless you and your family so you can continue leading this great company out of this crisis. I have been with the company for almost 21 years. I remember the difficult days that we have been through during this time . Particularly I remember like yesterday when I used to be in Omaha and you came there and, talked to all of us and gave us hope and your commitment to turn things around in those uncertain and difficult days after the merger and promised to make this a great company. We all rallied behind you and we turned this company into one of the greatest company in the world. We are with you now, and with your leadership we will turn this around again. For most of us, Enron is not just a place to work. It is part of us.  It is our family. It is our life. In the current situation the pain we feel is the same as if one of our loved one was seriously sick and we did not know what to do except to follow the advise of the doctor. We will follow your advise and give you our 200% . On a personal level for me this a very emotional and painful time. I have grown with this company that has given me great opportunities.  Currently I am working in Bolivia as president of Gas TransBoliviano and feel perhaps there is something I should be doing to help in this situation. Mr. Lay, If there is anything I can do above and beyond my current job, please let me know. You have my commitment and I will not disappoint you. Please consider me like one of those guys in NY showing up with shovels to help after the WTC disaster. I am hoping that I will be called upon. Again, may God bless you and your family. Look forward to seeing you in San Antonio.

With Kind Regards,

Nasim Khan

CRM Talk Back Lessons Learned - Holiday Shopping on the Net 2001  This year I decided to purchase all of my Holiday gifts on the Internet - even down to the wrapping paper and tape.  By using sites that offered free shipping or deep discounts I was able to save over $100 dollars by not paying sales tax and I got to avoid the malls.  The following represents my Top Ten Observations:  Be prepared to turn your home into a warehouse! I ordered over 20 items from Amazon that resulted in 12 large boxes.  Why does Barbie need her own box that could easily hold a DVD player?   Consolidating orders could work for me, even if it meant a slight delay in arrival. Pet peeve number 1 - After many hours of ""browsing"" items and comparing prices, I settled on an item.   Three days later I received an email saying that the item was out of stock.   This reminded me of retail bait and switch tactics.  If you don't have the product, take it off your site! Pet peeve number 2 - Customer service representatives who don't have information about your online order.   If you are going to sell online you need to service your online customers.   The days of being able to say - ""I will research this and get back to you"" are over.  Companies need to empower their front line personnel with data.   It's too easy for me just to place my next order with the competition. Pet peeve number 3 - Let me track my package.  Those sites that do not allow tracking of orders cost company more money.  It means you had to place numerous calls to their service department to check on delivery status. Pet peeve number 4 - Shopping carts that ""lock up"".  When this happens I not only abandon my order, I abandon doing business with the company. Great stuff number 1 - After placing an order some companies sent me an email with a discount gift certificate to use on my next order.  This ""25%"" sent me rushing back to the site, which built customer loyalty. Great stuff number 2 - Payal.  When buying on eBay, this service allows you to email funds directly to the seller.  No money order, no checks, and the funds can come right out of your checking or saving accounts.  It's a great way to do business and it's free. Great stuff number 3 - There are a few things that really stand out on some sites.  Here they are:   Allowing the customer to ""search"" the site - seems so simple - but not everyone has the capability.  Pre-filled forms.  When I go back to a site to place another order it's great when my shipping and billing information is already there.   It saves me time and also increases my loyalty. Great stuff number 4 - Comparison-shopping for price.  Sites like mysimon.com and cnet.com allowed me to find the best deals.  The price and shipping rates differ in such a big way from company to company - a great tool especially for electronics. Internet shopping has come a long way.  Those companies that make it easy to do business with them have a great advantage.  However, that advantage is quickly lost when the user experience comes up short in the service area.  Companies that respond to emails, and can answer customer questions over the phone help to bridge the gap between the expectations of the customer and the experience the customer has.  As companies strive to create their brand and the need to ""arm"" their sites and customer service organization with best of breed technology becomes critical.  I will gladly spend my money with the company but they have to give me a reason to not spend it with their  competitor.  What was the last Internet customer service experience you had?  Did the company go out of its way to satisfy you? Or was it just the opposite? We want to hear from you.  Please emaileuffer@roundarch.com  with your story.   Did You Know?  [IMAGE]  In This Issue: Content Management and Its Importance to your Portal Strategy  What is Content Management?   Content Management is defined as the people, processes and the systems that organizations use to create, store, update and distribute its key information and intellectual assets.   Although this definition may vary, the key concepts do not change across organizations.  It has become very apparent in the marketplace that with the proliferation of portal and web sites the content management challenge is becoming an increasing focus in large organizations.  Clients are more and more driving technology decisions based on content management requirements as opposed to portal needs.   Forrester defines Enterprise Content Management as ""an integrated approach to managing documents, Web content and digital assets"".  This is the broadest sense of content management.  One way to gain a clear picture of the term ""content management"" is to consider the various segments of the content life cycle.  The most pertinent segments to content management are:  Content Creation - Includes creation/revision, collaboration, review and approval.  The review and approval process can utilize workflow built into content management applications.  Content Maintenance - Includes content storage, access control and version control.  Content that has been created and approved is stored in a repository or database.  This content can then be combined with other approved content items to create rich sets of information.  Additionally, previous versions of content items are maintained and can be accessed at any time to bring back a previous state of information without introducing rework.  Content Delivery/Distribution - Includes the deployment of approved content from repository to an information channel.  Stored content can be aggregated and deployed to any number of channels (web, print, call center, wireless device etc.) utilizing specifically defined formats.  This is called channelization and is one of the major benefits to content management.  Content Management streamlines the process of creating, managing and delivering content, and puts processes in place to manage and control information as it is moved across the enterprise and to customers through the various information channels.  Historically, content management systems have not addressed all segments but rather focused  specifically on one or two.  Some systems may focus more on content creation, format and delivery (Web Content Management) whereas others may be more focused on storage and maintenance of documents and other forms of unstructured content (Document Management Systems).   Fortunately, content management solutions are maturing and  these two worlds are starting to converge to better serve the entire enterprise.  Not everyone is there but the future is bright and therefore, consideration to the type of content that is to be managed is important input into making a decision on the system that will best serve an organization's needs.  As content management matures and addresses the enterprise in a more holistic manner, organizations must consider the change to the enterprise that must take place to realize the benefits of such systems.   Content creation is no longer limited to a few but can be distributed among many with little or no technical skills.  Content approval and distribution can be handled programmatically in addition to manually and will require careful consideration to future roles and processes.  With so much change it is important to leadership to embrace the idea of content management by recognizing the importance of managing that will most certainly take place.  This may include  conducting a change readiness assessment and a change management plan.  Additionally, it is also important for leadership to have clear buy-in so that the organization understands the importance of the many steps that will be required to take on the road to content management.  5 Challenges to Content Management Implementation  Enterprises have complex workflows to move information across departments, but limited control or collaboration on how that information is edited, managed, published or retired - resulting in inconsistencies across the enterprise and customers. Conversion is a major undertaking of any Content Management implementation and requires a solid understanding of existing content and how to best organize it to improve efficiencies.   This requires an assessment of structured vs. unstructured content to understand how content will be organized and if more structure is required. Globalization increases the complexity of the entire content lifecycle, as multiple versions of content assets must be managed in addition to translation.  Additionally, support of multiple languages requires applications that can handle the required character sets and becomes important when selecting software packages. Defining the appropriate content attributes (meta tags).  Attributes define the meaning of content and are integral to good organization and appropriate personalization. Integration with Enterprise Applications can present challenges to the development effort.  This is especially true if the Content Management does not have a pre-built interface.  10 Problems in Existing Enterprises that Content Management Applications Can Resolve  As content assets increase in number, it becomes more and more difficult for content authors and administrators to find a single piece of content they are looking for, compounding confusion and efficiency. Increasing number of authors can quickly cause version control and communication issues.  As an enterprise expands nationally or even globally, this issue can quickly be  compounded by access limitations. Abandoned protocol (manual approval processes being ignored). Authors with no technical skills depend on technical resources to get content published to the appropriate locations.  This can create a bottleneck at the development team and cause significant delays to getting current information out to customers. Changes to web content may be required daily, hourly or even every minute.  This can quickly become and impossible task for a web master or group of content managers who are manually making changes and deploying content to various media. Management of multiple types of content assets (texts, graphics, multimedia etc.) is almost impossible to organize and deploy efficiently without the programmatic organization of content management application. Where different media (print, web, wireless, etc.) are supported separately, it is often difficult to maintain consistency of content due to development time a resource availability. Departmental ownership of content. Client participation.   Ongoing ownership and support requires the client to be involved from beginning to end. Maintaining control of project scope is always challenging, especially when dealing with relatively new technology such as content management systems.  This is quickly compounded as applications to integrate with are added to the plan.  Scope control can be maintained and expectations can be managed with a thorough definition of the project up front.   5 Things To Ask Vendors When Selecting a Content Management Product  What enterprise applications do you integrate with/have partnerships with? What unique capabilities does your product provide over your competitor's? How customizable is your product? Does your product support standards based programming (Java, XML)? How long has this product been out and how many customers have implemented it to date?  Critical Steps to Developing Your Content Management Solution:  Conduct a 3-4 week project to confirm the content management and conversion requirements, assess the current capability, develop client specific value proposition and develop a project roadmap for a rollout of content management solution.  The activities in this discovery effort include:  Content inventory - content type, frequency of updates, formats, source Content management workflow - number of people/departments authoring content, business processes and roles for authoring, editing, approval and publishing content Content conversion requirements - amount of legacy content, types of formats, structured or unstructured content, technical approach (e.g. bulk conversion programs, manual conversion, etc.) Repurposing of content - publish to multiple media formats (e.g. web, wireless, pdf, paper) Integration to the portal - identify prototype data model and build estimate for integration to portal engine Develop client specific value proposition for the content management solution and identify tangible benefits   The Bottom Line: Content Management Value Propositions  Closes the gap to the goal of the 'extended enterprise', where organizations work closely together  Provides a single content repository to store content that can be repurposed, thus eliminating the duplication of effort for creating the same content for multiple channels (Websites, Portal, Extranets/Intranets, Wireless, Print)  Provides business user the power to manage content  Enables efficient communications across the enterprise  Presents dynamic and relevant content to the constituent user  Provides corporations with the ability to reach global audience with a localized message  An embedded workflow facilitates content creation and editorial process, which increases the business unit's commitment to quality and accountability  Provides content assurance - share proprietary content with partners and suppliers  Provides capabilities for authors in different geographies to create, update, and publish content  Separates the content from the application logic  Rapid development to keep pace with information updates on various mediums  Problem Solved: Content Management in Enterprise Portal Case Studies  The State of California needed a content management system that would allow its communications department to rapidly deploy new content and features without the intervention of technical staff, yet maintain control over the content creation and deployment processes through workflow.  Roundarch implemented and integrated a content management solution that answered this need, and put in place an infrastructure that empowered the State to quickly disseminate information to constituents on the My California portal.  For information, contact Paula Itagaki pitagaki@roundarch.com  or Dan Loos dloos@roundarch.com  or go to www.ca.gov .  A Blue Cross Blue Shield Company wanted a content management solution that demonstrated seamless integration with its portal solution, strong tagging capabilities to target public and secure content to specific constituents, and a simple content entry interface that put the power of content in the hands of business users.  Roundarch developed a single content management solution that provided centralized content creation and publishing processes to deliver personalized content for providers, members, and employers.  For more information, contact Paula Itagaki  pitagaki@roundarch.com  or Manish Bharadwaj  mbharadwaj@roundarch.com .  This company is a leading global supplier of cement, aggregate, and concrete.  Roundarch developed the global content management solution and commerce site that uses six languages, three currencies, and integrates to different ERP systems.  Business users rather than the IT department maintain site content.  With the new streamlined content management workflow established all the content is reviewed and approved before it is published.

Dear Friends,
This was shared throughout a group from our church and sounds like
worthwhile, simple info.  Can't hurt to try it if the need arises!
Love and Blessings, Margaret and JohnHEART ATTACK SELF HELPThis is NOT a chain letter.
If everyone who gets this sends it to 10 people, you can bet that we'll
save at least one life.
Let's say it's 6:15 p.m. and you're driving home (alone of course),
after an unusually hard day on the job. You're really tired, upset and
frustrated. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest
that starts to radiate out into your arm and up into your jaw. You are
only
about five miles from the hospital nearest your home; unfortunately
you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do?
You've been trained in CPR but the guy that taught the course neglected
to
tell you how to perform it on yourself.
HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this
article
seemed to be in order. Without help, the person whose heart stops
beating
properly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left
before losing consciousness.
However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and
very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and
the
cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep
inside the chest.
Deep breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without
let up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating
normally
again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements
squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.
The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm,
this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital.
Tell as many other people as possible about this, it could save their
lives!

ACCOUNTING IN CRISIS 
One Plus One Makes What? 
The accounting profession had a credibility problem before Enron. Now it has a crisis. 
FORTUNE
Monday, January 7, 2002 
Where were the auditors? People ask that question after every corporate collapse, and lately they've been asking it with disturbing frequency. At Waste Management, Sunbeam, Rite Aid, Xerox, and Lucent, major accounting firms either missed or ignored serious problems. The number of public companies that have corrected or restated earnings since 1998 has doubled to 233, according to a study by Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Now, following the stunning bankruptcy of Andersen's own client Enron, that question--where were the auditors?--has become a deafening refrain. ""I believe that there is a crisis of confidence in my profession,"" Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino told a congressional committee investigating Enron's collapse in mid-December. ""Real change will be required to regain the public trust."" 
The full story of the Enron debacle--and what Andersen did or did not do in its audit--will take months to emerge. In the meantime, no one disagrees with Berardino's diagnosis that there's a crisis in accounting--even if his sudden emphasis on industrywide reform springs from a desire to deflect attention from Andersen's own culpability. But the kind of ""real change"" required is a matter of substantial debate. The government gave the franchise of auditing public companies' financial statements to the accounting industry after the 1929 stock market crash. In the decades since, the accountants have adroitly avoided significant government regulation by arguing that they can police themselves. Now, post-Enron, they're doing it again. The Big Five CEOs issued a rare joint statement outlining how they intend to strengthen financial reporting and auditing standards. ""Self-regulation is right for investors, the profession, and the financial markets,"" the release concludes. 
But is it? Accounting's main self-regulatory body, the Public Oversight Board, is a monument to the profession's failures. The POB was created in the late 1970s, when Congress held hearings on a string of audit failures at public companies that had--much like the recent rash--shaken confidence in the major auditing firms. The POB, which has no enforcement power, investigates alleged audit failures and oversees a triennial review process in which the major accounting firms examine one another's procedures. And yet problems persist; arguably, they have grown more acute. ""Is accounting self-regulation working? On the face of it, it is not,"" says Representative John Dingell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who has long sparred with the accounting profession. 
In their defense, the auditors note that current accounting methods, many of which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today's complex financial transactions. And there is no way, they insist, to prevent sophisticated fraud. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they are accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of those few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 billion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements since 1995. 
Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been accountants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the years, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into ""professional services"" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profits from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelters, and evaluating their business strategies. In 1999, according to the SEC, half of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, vs. 13% in 1981. 
Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused of using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to sell more-profitable consulting contracts. ""Audit work is a marvelous marketing tool,"" says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at Columbia University. ""You are already there doing the audit. You say their internal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?"" But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management (consulting). ""You cannot serve them both,"" says former SEC commissioner Bevis Longstreth. 
This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 million in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid both as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as its internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its books and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone raised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting fees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. ""If you are auditing your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them,"" says Robert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accounting profession's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen has not revealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed consulting fees compromise their objectivity. ""They have militantly refused to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem,"" Longstreth says.

"World Economic Forum, Energy Governors Meeting","Dear Dr Lay,

Thank you very much for your prompt response concerning the Preparatory
Meeting for the Energy Governors Meeting in Davos. Of course, I am fully
aware what a long way it is to go for a one-day meeting from Houston to
Geneva.

However, in order to prepare a successful Governors Meeting, the issue
selection is primordial. I am pleased that among the first confirmations
for the Preparatory Meeting we received confirmations from ABB Ltd, ENI
SPA, Royal Dutch/Shell, Saudi Aramco, Statoil Group, Ruhrgas, some of which
will be represented by their top-executives. Nevertheless, in order to have
a representative overview on issue priorities I would very much appreciate
your feedback on the issue list that had been attached to the invitation
for the Preparatory Meeting. (I re-attach it to this email.)

(See attached file: issues.doc)

I will participate at this years World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires.
Should you be planning to be there, it would be a great pleasure for me to
meet with you on this occasion in order to get an in-depth feedback on your
specific interests concerning the Energy Governors Meeting. I will stay at
the Reconquista Plaza hotel (Tel.: 54 11 4311 4600 / Fax: 54 11 4311 3302).

Should you have any questions concerning the Governors Meeting, please do
not hesitate to contact me any time.

Yours sincerely,
Christoph Frei

"","Ken,

My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in
Midland, Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enron's
Gas Pipeline Group for almost 19 years.  I left the company is December
2000. I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron shares.

I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under
duress a major concern. by Jamie Lareau.  This article focused on how to
recognize CEO's and CEO candidates who were not up to the requirements
of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example.  I have agreed with
views of this journalist for some time, especially since Jeff called a
fund manager an ""asshole"".  Publically calling someone is simply Not
something any CEO should do and you and Enron's board should have done
something about Jeff then.

My point is as follows:  Where were you and the Enron Board during all
this?  Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton
virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally
concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base?  A lot of
people believed Jeff's hype and many people have suffered!  Has Jeff
suffered?.  I think not especially since he has left Enron with millions
of our dollars in his pocket.  Hopefully he will be able to afford the
time off to ""find himself"".

Did you see the movie ""Top Gun""?  Toward the end of the movie, Tom
Cruise, otherwise know as Maverick, blamed himself for the loss of his
friend and simply disengaged from combat flying.  However, when things
got really rough, Maverick re-engaged the enemy and did what he was
hired to do.

Do you know where this is going?

You are once again Enron's ""Top Gun""!  The enemy is Enron's depressed
stock price.  It is time for you to re-engage and live up to your title
of ""Top Gun"" and CEO!  I and the rest of Enron's stock holders need you
to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan
Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix.

I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job.  If you are
not, refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down.

Sincerely,

Neal Shaw

"Tillman Fertitta","Ken:

Thank you for speaking with Tillman.  As requested, I spoke with him yesterday (along with his CFO).  There was confusion on their part as to what Enron's offer is; related to a meeting some months back by our former bundled group.  I updated them as to our current offering and they expressed interest in receiving some pricing.  The ball is in their court to provide me some information to price their stores, but I hope to receive something from them soon.

I will let you know where we wind up.

Thanks again,

"This is a follow up to mail sent you Nov.30,2001from Sue D. Hester","Mr. Ken Lay,
To explain further , I put $25,000.00 in Enron Capital Limited Life
company 8%PFD cumulative guaranteed monthly income preferred shares.
CUSIP# P37307108 bought 11-04-1993 in name of Sue Diviney Hester through
A.G Edwards acct. # 42-323-160. In reading the prospectus dated Oct. 25,
1993 page S14 under General , second paragraph . The entire principal
amount of the loan will become due and payable upon the date which Enron
is dissolved , wound up or liquidated or the date upon whichEnron Capital
is dissolved or liquidated. There is more that I won`t refer to at this
time . I do hope you can find a way to repay this debt under some of
these provisions , please give it your attention . I know this is small
stuff and you are busy but I need your help Mr. Lay . Maybe I can count
on you to find a way out for me so I can continue to be able to support
myself.

What about our medical benefits, can it possibly continue ? I have had
cancer as well as an uncurable lung diesese . I can not see any way I
will be accepted in other plans .

I am holding 200 shares in Northern Borders Partners LP unit partnership
interest since 9-23-1993 CUSIP 664785102 at First Chicago Trust . Acct
#8124-27264. It looks like it maybe holding its value now but will it be
effected by what ever happens to Enron ?

Enron was a great company, I was so proud of it. You made it that and you
can do it again if given half a chance. I Pray someone will put enough
confidence in it so it can remain a company to build on and become a lot
better than it was with out the selfish greed that has brought this on
us.

Thank you for reading my letter,

"VANGUARD: The Necessity of Civil Defense","


Vanguard of the Revolution
http://www.theVanguard.org


THE NECESSITY OF CIVIL DEFENSE
by
Rod D. Martin, 16 January 2002



September 11th brought into sharp focus the defenselessness of America.  And
despite our astonishingly-effective offensive campaign in Afghanistan, here
at home we remain as we were.

The United States maintains armed forces in over a hundred countries around
the world; nevertheless, on the morning the World Trade Center was
destroyed, there was not one air defense battery to shoot down the hijacked
airliners, not one ""Star Wars"" system to destroy the atomic bombs which
might have come next; and not one American town had the ability to shelter
its people against nuclear, biological or chemical attack.

This unconscionable vulnerability remains, and the threats are only growing.
Even if no terrorist groups presently possess ballistic missiles, states do
arm terrorists, and practice terrorism themselves.  And the number of
wicked, unstable, and well-armed states grows by the day.

Much of this can and should be addressed by deploying air and missile
defenses, something Republicans have been trying to do since Goldwater.
This need is so obvious that even Russian President Putin barely whimpered
when George Bush withdrew America from the ABM Treaty.  Only the Loony Left
complained.

But strategic defense is only half the equation.  No defense is perfect, and
""something"" might always slip through, particularly if the ""something"" in
question is a terrorist bomb on a ship, on a plane, or in a truck.

This is why America needs a civil defense.

The president of Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, Dr. Jane Orient,
explains this need very simply: ""If that soot raining down in Brooklyn [from
the World Trade Center] had been radioactive, there would be many thousands,
maybe millions of people dying slow, agonizing deaths from radiation
sickness that could have been prevented had people had access to shelter.""

But there are no shelters.

After an early rush to protect Americans in the 1950s -- from the
construction of fallout shelters to the famous ""duck and cover"" drills in
schools -- civil defense was effectively gutted by JFK.  Shelters and such
didn't fit with the spirit of MAD (""Mutual Assured Destruction""); nor did
they have big-ticket defense contractors to lobby for them.  After a brief
revival under Reagan, the Cold War ended, and with it the program:  Bill
Clinton officially abolished the Office of Civil Defense, selling off the
few emergency supplies which remained.

During the Cold War, calls for even the most basic civil defense measures
were met by Leftists with retorts like ""why waste time on civil defense?
When you came out of the shelter, there'd be nothing left.""  The very idea
of protecting American families was ridiculed by peaceniks with slogans like
""after a nuclear attack the living will envy the dead.""

These were stupid comments even then; they ring imbecilic today.  After an
atomic September 11th there would have been an entire country left, waiting
desperately for the return of its loved ones:  men, women and children whose
lives could have been saved with just two week's shelter from the
radioactive rain.  Yet the legacy of this hippie foolishness remains.

Other countries were never so dumb.  The Soviet Union built and stocked
sufficient shelters to house over 90% of its population, and required
regular civil defense training for all.  China's system is so vast and so
thorough that an entire city such as Beijing can be evacuated in ten
minutes.  Switzerland's civil defense network is designed to handle its
entire population, as well as tens of thousands of refuges; and it's
equipped to handle biological and chemical attacks as well.

Why should Americans have less?  Why, in fact, do Americans have nothing at
all?

Civil defense is low-tech and low-budget:  starting from nothing, we could
protect every American for a one-time investment of about $500 per person,
or less than half of our so-called ""Defense"" budget for one year (and less
than 10% of one year's federal budget).  After that, it's all maintenance
and training.

A proper civil defense would give America -- and Americans -- the means to
survive:  survive terrorist attacks, survive the inevitable wars of the 21st
Century, survive even natural disasters like the tornadoes that pummel our
heartland every year.  And make no mistake:  a foreign enemy facing an
America which can shoot down its missiles and survive what get through will
think a lot more than twice before attacking.  Japan -- and now Afghanistan
-- have clearly demonstrated the cost of waking, but not killing, the
sleeping giant.

But above all else, civil defense is just the right thing to do, morally as
well as constitutionally.  What kind of leaders don't protect their own
people?  And what sort of nation spends billions on weapons but leaves its
cities -- its children -- undefended?  Earlier generations understood this
well; and the mark of real leadership in our brave new world will surely be
returning to those roots.

"PBS public relations opportunity","
Dear  Ken,
 
First, let me thank  you again for your continued support of Scenic Missouri and Scenic Texas through  your family foundation.  We are very grateful that you have embraced our  efforts to save ""America the Beautiful.""  
 
Second, I wanted to  make sure you were aware of what I think may be a great public relations  opportunity for Enron.  I think you may have already heard from Kathy  Whitmire about it.  While at a Scenic America board meeting at Harlan  Crow's Camp Topridge (you may have been there), I learned about Scenic America's  upcoming program on PBS.  This will consist of a series of six airings of a  30 minute documentary on Scenic America, its mission and the issues with which  it is involved.  Kathy Whitmire was at the meeting as was Carroll Shaddock,  founder and chairman of Scenic Texas.  A substantial advertising discount  is being made available to the corporation that sponsors this documentary.   This might be a perfect match for Enron, especially in light of your  demonstrated commitment to the missions of Scenic America and its  affiliates.  
 
At any rate, I hope  you will give this your consideration.  Thanks so much for your ongoing  help and support.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Karl  Kruse
Executive  Director

Current Policy Issues in Securities Regulation

Wednesday, May 30, 2001, 9:00 a.m.-3:30 p.m.
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI
1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

The basic structure for the public distribution of securities in the United States-which places limits on a company's communications before a final prospectus is available-was adopted almost seventy years ago, before the revolution in electronic communications and the advent of the Internet. The capital markets are globalized for institutions trading privately, but the access of U.S. residents to foreign securities is still restricted in various ways. The SEC's recent Regulation FD (""Fair Disclosure""), which requires companies to disseminate material information to the public at the same time the information is distributed to selected groups, may diminish the role of analysts as information intermediaries.
	Does the communications revolution require changes in the securities distribution process? Is there a responsible way to create truly globalized securities markets? Is Regulation FD soundly based in policy or academic work? This conference, sponsored jointly with the Securities Industry Association, will address these and other questions.

"RE: Fund raiser for Enron","Ken,

I greatly appreciate your reply, I also agree that the merger was the best alternative, given the circumstances. It saddens me to think that I will not be working for Enron, I had planned to retire from here.  I pray that you will be at peace with your decision and that you will have a happy retirement, put it all behind you and know that you did everything you could and we have a great amount of respect and appreciation for you.  We will definitely miss you and your leadership.  I hope that Dynegy appreciates the value that they are obtaining and the gift of the talented and innovative employees that they will be getting.  Everything will work out for the best.

Subject:	Fund raiser for Enron

Dear Mr. Lay,

My manager and I were discussing the possibility of doing a fund raiser for Enron.  We contributed an absorbant amount of money to charities this year and last, would it not be possible to raise money to help our company.  Do a little belt tightening.  We could do without the Christmas party, do without our bonuses and next year at this time, when we are back on top, it would be a sweeter glory knowing that the employees helped turn everything around.  I have spoken with my HR rep and several other employees about this possibility and we feel that we would be able to raise a substantial amount of money.  Please let me know what your view on this would be and we will work on what steps we need to take to make it happen.

Thank you for your time.

"VIP Message for My Warriors!!!!","""In quietness and confidence is your strength.""  --  Isaiah 30:15

	A missionary in India was kneeling at his bed praying one night when a
giant python snake uncoiled itself from the rafters and wrapped itself
around his body.  The python, which is not uncommon in India, kills its
victim by squeezing it to death.  The missionary told how a Bible verse
immediately came to mind as the meandering serpent enveloped his body.  ""In
quietness and confidence is your strength.""  And suddenly he was filled with
the calm assurance that God was in control!  He remained perfectly still,
praying and meditating like he never had before!

	Had he struggled, hesitated or tensed up, the coils of the mighty creature
would have constricted and crushed him!  Instead he waited, prayed, stayed
calm and didn't move a muscle.  Slowly, the snake uncoiled itself and
retreated back to the rafters.

	Most of us admire that kind of quiet COURAGE.  I don't believe there is a
value that is more recognizable and admirable in a human life than courage.
Claim the courage that is yours as a child of God.  God wants you to be
courageous!


I AM MADE FOR CONFIDENT, COURAGEOUS LIVING.  TODAY, I CAN FEEL MY FEARS
SLIPPING AWAY AS GOD FILLS ME WITH COURAGE!

I Love you.

>How does this relate to Enron? Enron Industrial Markets (EIM) is

>such as natural gas and electricity. Coincidentally EIM just made a
>presentation of its plans to enter as a market maker in the steel
>market, and the executives at the steel company that John and his
>co-author work with in Connecticut shared with John an impressive
>binder from a recent presentation by EIM. After
>discussing this presentation with the general manager and studying
>the presentation binder, John feels that Enron's business plan is
>much more likely to succeed than either esteel.com or metalsite.com.
>His analysis of the steel market suggests that there are considerable
>informational imperfections, and that there is ample room for
>successful, profitable entry by a leading company such as Enron that
>has an intelligent and aggressive business plan. John believes that
>Enron is in a strong position to succeed in the steel market using
>its experience in other markets, their successful enrononline.com
>trading site, and their huge financial resources that would enable
>them to conduct the marketing operations to get their market off the
>ground.
>
>The other area where John feel's that his research could connect to,
>and be useful for, Enron in steel and other commodities markets is
>his work on using dynamic programming methods to solve for and
>compute optimal speculative trading strategies. John is perhaps the
>world expert in calculating optimal policies with regard to managing
>inventory levels. These include the optimal timing of purchase
>decisions, the optimal quantities to purchase when purchases are
>optimal, and the optimal markups of retail prices over wholesale
>prices. John and his co-author have developed computer programs that
>can rapidly compute the optimal policies (in less than 2 minutes on

>New England. They plan to deliver a computerized version of their

>company. John and his co-author hope to compare how the trading
>profits generated by the computer program compare to the trading

 Teamwork Newsletter  NOVEMBER 2001 	
  Trust is the fuel that moves companies forward  Business is down. Layoffs loom. Employees are focusing on their family, and many fear losing their jobs. Yet, you need to move your company or your department forward. You need to move upward and onward. What does it take? Trust! We suggest that it is Trust that allows the balance between the opposing demands of work and quality of life.   As always, moving forward requires a balance of effectiveness vs. efficiency and short-term vs. long-term goals. A closely connected tenet of these four is trust and getting to trust is a process that can be worked on.  The ability to work  towards the future as a team requires trust because the future is pure promise, and has no reality in the here and now. Without trust, there can be no agreement concerning future events. After all, certain real, clashing interests will be sacrificed in the short term, for an unreal future built on promises. Trust is the factor that permits common goals to benefit both parties.  Thus, conflicts of interest are resolved through common goals pursed in an atmosphere of mutual trust. Those who understand capi (coalesced authority, power and influence) know that it naturally gives rise to conflicting interests. To get things done, a team must have common goals or interests to bind them together. Mutual suspicion must give way to mutual trust.  As we well know, the bearers of various implementation forces come into conflicts that simply do not get resolved. When fundamentally different interests are at issue, resolution often seems impossible. There are no obvious or immediate win-win solutions. In fact, Dr. Adizes makes the bold declaration that when conflict arises among people with different interests, the short-term outcomes can never satisfy both parties. In the short term, conflicting interests can only be addressed by a compromise, where both parties? interests suffer, or by a win-lose scenario that leaves one party seriously disgruntled.  Destructive conflict over different interests manifests itself as long, drawn out tensions between the different players. The conflict will not go away. The trick is to harness that conflict to achieve something, rather than trying to pretend that it does not exist. Avoiding conflict is not the secret. Encouraging constructive conflict is the way to move forward. Trust is the only path to constructive conflict in a situation of different interests.  However, trust can only be earned over time. To establish trust, one must establish a history of living up to promises. Since trust can be eroded in a split second, making the pursuit of common goals increasingly difficult, one must move slowly and carefully and in a non-threatening manner as one builds that history of trust.

"FW: Enron Management Conference","
Dear Ken,

I wanted to let you know that we've extended an invitation to speak at the Management Conference to your friend Irwin Stelzer.  In a meeting with Greg Whalley and Steve Kean a few weeks ago, we'd discussed the idea of having an economist speak at the management conference in light of recent world events and their impact on the national economy.  After running the names of several respected economists by Mr. Stelzer and reviewing their tapes, Steve Kean and I opted to invite Mr. Stelzer.  (He promised he is better than any of the others we were considering and he won't charge us.)

I sent a note inviting Mr. Stelzer on Friday afternoon.  This is his very prompt response.  (I have to say, your exceptional reputation and valued friendships make my job easy.)

I'll be in contact with Mr. Stelzer today to work through logistics.

"Your efforts are appreciated","Just wanted to let each of you know that I pray for you daily.  You've had an enormous amount of responsibility over the last few weeks and I believe you have probably given great personal sacrifice to try to get our business back on it's feet.  I think you have given it your best effort and are extremely disappointed in the outcome.
 
I will continue to pray for you and the rest of the Enron employees.  My team is still working extremely hard to do our part to help in this crisis.  Not one of us has given up  - although some people may think that is a little crazy given the circumstances.  If you ever want to feel a little appreciated, come down to our floor and visit.  
 
I'm the Director of Human Resources for ENW Technology groups.   I have a great Human Resources group that doesn't know the meaning of quit.   Heck, one of our group, Norma Yeverino, is nine months pregnant and is still here late every night just to make sure we support all our clients 100%.
 
Well, just wanted you to know that you're not in this alone.  Come on by the 36th floor and meet the team.

"Conflict of Interest","
Dear Mr. Lay,

Thank you for your email message. I imagine you are quite disenchanted with
India-specific issues, and in light of your staggering responsibilities, may
choose to spend little time on this email. I have enormous respect for you
as a leader. As such, I write to appeal to your finer sensibilities, and to
point out simple errors in the way the matter was probably explained to you,
and that which is evident in the email below. This explanation is important
to me for two reasons: (i) The size of the outstanding bonus is material to
me (ii) I do not wish for Enron to consider that there were any conflict of
interest issues during the course of my employment.

Conflict of Interest:
1. I had informed the entire senior management team of Enron India of the
investments I wanted to make in the internet companies, and of Global
Telesystems' role therein. I informed my CEO Sanjay Bhatnagar, my COO Wade
Cline, and my General Counsel Sandeep Katwala prior to my investments. From
time to time, my internet investment was joked about, talked about, and
discussed informally and openly  in senior management meetings, e.g. the PRC
meetings, strategy reviews etc. Furthermore, at the time I was starting the
companies, I had even sought the assistance of the GC in identifying outside
lawyers who could assist me in establishing complex cross-border legal
structures. I believe the three gentlemen I have mentioned will confirm this
point.

2. When Enron India's Broadband venture was merged with EBS Houston, the new
Houston based management did not know about my investment. This was quite
understandable, since there was little or no interaction between the two
groups prior to the merger. They asked for a full explanation, and I did so
through the process established by Kevin Hannon and Ken Rice: an inquiry by
Rob Walls. Furthermore, I offered to Rob Walls that if they felt there were
any perceived conflicts of interest, I would be willing to clear them in any
way as suggested by Houston. This would even include selling my investments
at a loss. My commitment to Enron was paramount.


At all times I maintained complete transparency on my investments. I
informed about them to everyone, from my administrative assistant to my CEO.
At the discretion of the management (Sanjay Bhatnagar was my manager for
2000, the year for which the bonus was to be paid), the amount decided was $
85,000. But when Sanjay Bhatnagar decided to leave Enron in early January
2001, Kevin Hannon terminated my employment on January 24. 2001. The
decision to not pay the bonus was made in retrospect by people who were not
my managers for the year in question, and was little else but punitive.
Indeed, Ken Rice and Rob Walls admitted in subsequent conversations to
Sanjay Bhatnagar that  there was no conflict of interest, but some action
had to be appear to be taken.

I sincerely hope the unpleasantness surrounding the Indian government's
dealings with Enron, as well as incomplete information that may have been
submitted to you by Kevin Hannon will not prejudice your decision in this
matter. May I request that the issue of the Bonus be reconsidered.

With warm regards and best wishes for your new role,

Annat Jain

Dear Mr. Jain:

Thank you for your email messages.  Prior to your termination, this
matter was reviewed by several members of Enron's Senior management
team, including Jeff Skilling and Kevin Hannon, two members of Enron's
Corporate Policy Committee.  I learned that although you were employed
at Enron India throughout calendar year 2000, there were significant
conflict of interest issues surrounding your involvement, while an Enron
employee, with two Internet companies and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Global Telecom.  As a result, Senior management determined that it would
be in the best interests of all parties to terminate the employment
relationship.

Upon your termination of employment, you were entitled to severance
under the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan.  However, the payment of
bonuses to employees is at the discretion of management and your
management team in place at the time of your termination determined, in
its discretion, not to pay a bonus to you.

During the course of your employment with Enron, your contributions were
recognized.  I wish you well in your future endeavors.

Very truly yours,


Kenneth L. Lay""

	Thank you for your presentation yesterday.  As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.  I was literally mortified when I heard the ""crack"" question-- but I think you handled that well too.  As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INCOMPETENCE

The American people justifiably feel sickened by the FBI's
mishandling of evidence in the Timothy McVeigh case, but they
shouldn't be surprised, according to economist Bruce Benson, senior
fellow at The Independent Institute.

""The FBI's failure to divulge reams of evidence to McVeigh's lawyers
is just the latest bungle in a history stretching back to when
President Theodore Roosevelt created its predecessor, the Bureau of
Investigation,"" writes Benson in a new op-ed.

""Regrettably, blunders and cover-ups are not confined to the FBI.
Despite cover-up attempts, similar scandals involving both state and
local prosecutors and police show that misrepresentation and even
falsification of forensic evidence occurs regularly.""

At the root of the systemic problems that plague public
law-enforcement, Benson argues, is poor accountability. Yet strong
accountability (and its offshoot, innovation) is the norm in the
private sector. This, according to Benson, explains why governments
are increasingly contracting with the private sector for police
dispatch, investigative services, fingerprinting, crime labs, traffic
control, data processing, prisoner transport and other traditional
police functions. Between 1964 and 1997, in fact, the number of
specialized security firms grew by more than 800 percent, while
employment by these firms grew by almost 925 percent.

This trend is explained by the simple fact that in police services,
as in other services, customers tend to get what they pay for. For
example:

* In 1992, the 2,565 private railroad police employed by major
railroads had a clearance rate (reported crimes cleared by arrest)
2.86 times greater than the clearance rate for public police.

* In the 1970s, a private investigation firm was contracted to look
into police corruption in small towns in Ohio and West Virginia.
Within months, the firm's efforts led to more than 150 arrests.

* After a drug scandal in 1993, the town of Sussex, New Jersey,
replaced its tiny four-officer police force with private policing
firm. Contracting out for policing is a common practice in
Switzerland and the Bahamas.

""Calls on Congress to once again investigate the FBI miss the mark,""
concludes Benson. ""Changing the political and bureaucratic delivery
of policing services requires fundamental reform, and the growth of
the private security industry strongly suggests how those reforms
ought to take shape.""

A Return to Privatized Police Services,"" at

INTEGRATING IMMIGRANTS

The best way for state governments to help integrate immigrants into
American life is to promote private schooling, according to Alex
Tabarrok, research director at The Independent Institute.

In his testimony before the State of California's Little Hoover
Commission, Tabarrok argued that private schooling is the most
effective way to foster proficiency in the English language -- the
single most important skill for immigrants to learn.

California's public high schools, Tabarrok noted, have appalling
student dropout rates: 32 percent overall and about 45 percent for
immigrants. Dropout rates for similar students are much lower in
private schools. California's public schools also have little room
for educational diversity, experimentation or competition. In the
heated debate over bilingual education, no one questioned why
politicians, bureaucrats and voters should decide a question best
left to parents and educators. Private education is much better at
matching students with teaching styles and curricula best suited to
their individual needs.

Private schools are a benefit to native students as well as
immigrants. Lower dropout rates and greater college attendance for
natives reduces potential conflicts in the labor market between
low-skilled natives and immigrants.

Tabarrok also called for repealing laws and regulations that impede
entrepreneurship among immigrants, such as city regulations that have
eroded jitney services often run by immigrants and other economic
outsiders.

Tabarrok also noted that immigrant integration is not always
desirable. Immigrants, for example, often have stronger families,
high rates of entrepreneurship, and lower crime rates than do
natives, especially for their education and income levels.

""If natives had the same institutionalization rate as immigrants,""
Tabarrok said, ""our jails and prisons would have one-third fewer
inmates.""

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PATRICK HENRY

""Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price
of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what
course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me
death!""
   --Patrick Henry (b. 5/29/1736, d. 6/6/1799)

Memorial Day may get more fanfare, but for lovers of liberty Patrick
Henry's birthday is even more significant. While there is no denying
the need for a day of remembrance for the Americans who have died in
battle, what made their sacrifices meaningful is the principle behind
the American Ideal -- the principle articulated most passionately in
Patrick Henry's immortal words, ""give me liberty, or give me death.""

Ironic though it may at first seem, Henry's fighting words are the
words of a peacemaker. For the only lasting peace is one that arises
from an embrace of the principle of liberty -- peace and liberty are
two sides of the coin of a voluntary society. And the sooner that the
United States and other governments learn this, the less likely that
they will add to the list of those we remember on Memorial Day.

Patrick Henry also reminds us that liberty is not secured overnight.
A decade after the American Revolution, Henry fought hard to secure
the Bill of Rights; he recognized that an unlimited federal
government could be just as tyrannical as the British monarchy.

Patrick Henry should thus be remembered for both his principles and
his realism. A heart and mind united, Henry was a patriot to whom
Americans will always remain in debt.

Happy Birthday, Patrick Henry!

"Thank You","Mr. Lay,

These are tough times for our company.  There is a lot of justified anger and deep disappointment among our employees and shareholders.  However, at this time I want to thank you for sticking with us and helping to get the best deal for Enron.  You could have washed your hands, walked away and left us holding the bag.  But, you did not. It is reassuring that you are a CEO who will take the heat and do what is best for the company.  It measures the true character of the man.

It is unfortunate that you placed so much faith in those who have brought our company down.  However, it shows that you like the rest of us are only human.  I've admired your work over the years and am honored I was able to be a part of your organization.  I pray that God will be with you during this turmoil and He will give you strength to see it through. 

I will always remember my days at Enron with pride.  I enjoyed the many great men and women I worked with.  Thank you again, Mr. Lay, for all you have done.

"Bush Economic Team ""Inept""","This is from a morning briefing that goes out to all of the Schwab clients:

So it's a near-certainty that more stimulus is coming from Washington. But
the details change
constantly, as trial balloons are floated and shot down day after day. Some
quick highlights:
? In stark contrast to its foreign policy/defense team, the Bush economic
brain trust looks inept, unable to
coordinate its plans and apparently unwilling to provide much direction to
Congress.
? Filling that vacuum are Republicans who want big tax cuts and Democrats
who want to spend much
more.
? This means the budget surplus in fiscal 2002 is in free fall. It's
possible that the budget could go into
deficit this year, but our guess is that it will be in the black by a
little, probably under $50 billion. But
these estimates aren't worth much right now - the big story is that the
surplus is melting fast.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

"greeting from missouri","
Hi Ken,
 
How is my famous fabulous cousin???  Our son  Eric was home last weekend and went to the bank with me.  The banker, Eddie  Smith, came out to see Eric and see how he was doing.  He was glad Eric was  working on his MBA.  I mentioned that Eric had applied at Associated  Electric in Springfield but had already committed to an internship at an  insurance company and had agreed to be a graduate assistant for the fall  semester by the time Associated called him.  He would still like to get on  there at the beginning of next year.  Eddie said Associated was a good  co-op and would be a good starting place but that Eric might want to contact  Kenneth Lay.  He went on to say that Kenneth was Dewayne Rees' cousin  and started telling about all of your fine attributes and what a fine  company Enron is!  He thinks you have done quiet well for yourself!   Anyway, when he finally let me say something I informed him that you was also my  mothers first cousin and the rest of us claimed you also!  He had to think  about that for a minute but finally put the connections together.  Eddie  has always been really good to my parents and to us.  I worked for him  several years ago and he takes credit for helping raise me!  
 
Erin graduated from high school last Friday  night.  She was one of the valedictorians and we are very proud of  her!  She accomplished this while working part-time at First National Bank  and she also completed 12 credit hours of college this year.   She is  planning on attending SMSU in Springfield in the fall.  In the more  immediate future, she plans to fly to Dallas the first of June to spend a week  with one of her friends families.  She did this last year and they took her  to San Antonio.  They really spoil her and she has decided that Texas is  the best place in the whole country!
 
So how is your family?  Any new  grandchildren?  We hope you and your family are having a  great year!  Keep in touch!
 
Your cousin, 
Janice Maxwell

"RE: Change of Control Provisions -An Apology","Ken,

I am writing this as an apology.  I have read about the heads of various companies and institutions, such as Railtrack here in the UK, taking large (huge) payments / payoffs / salaries while in charge of companies providing extremely poor levels of service and customer satisfaction.  After reading yesterday from various sources about the level of the provision in your contract I was extremely cynical.  After your voice mail / email this morning I am impressed and even uplifted.

Thank you.

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Subject: Illegal Action and Criminal Conduct / violation of human rights
Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2001 23:10:14 +0530

Enron Compliance officer

Re: Illegal Action:

I was working with Enron's offshore Power Operation CV at Dabhol Power
Plant, India since May 1998.  I was very honest, sincere and hardworking.
There was no allegations on me. My work was always appreciated including by
visiting audit teams from Houston.  However, I was very forthright when my
work was coming and even more whenever the interest of firm / Enron was at
stake including adherence to law. I also perused Enron's concept of "" Know
Why"". I was always ensuring the high dignity and value that was attached to
my job including of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

However, despite that, the officer in-charge at Dabhol Complex for reasons
best known to him developed vengeance against me and on 17th August 2001, my
services were illegally terminated by unilaterally and while acting out of
the capacity, imposing an alleged severance plan with effect from 17th
August 2001 itself which was never disclosed to me or accepted by me.
Subsequently, I was forced upon a cheque of severance amount on 27th August
2001 which I received under protest and the notice of such protest was
served by me on firm in the interest of justice. I submit such a termination
is illegal, bad in law and void ab-initio and accordingly and when such an
action was not corrected by firm, I constrained to approach the Court of
law. I, therefore, request your attention to the illegality of such an
action and suitable redressal / correction of such an action in the form of
my reinstatement in the job.

Re: Criminal Conduct / Violation to Human Rights:

On 27th August 2001, subsequent to my protest representation, I was
criminally man handled by officers of the firm / Enron namely Kenneth D.
Lambert, P R Krishna Murthy, Capt. Samuel Singh and Arvind Dabar. Besides
other criminal acts, I was criminally insulted, detained, physically hurted
by these persons inasmuch as, security was ordered to place a guard on me
and at my house. I was not allowed to go back to my house and my access was
blocked and I was thrown out of the colony premises in night without any aid
or consideration and out of no fault of me.I was constrained to approach
state police for my protection. Police also registered a criminal offence
under various sections of Indian Penal code at police station against these
four persons for atrocities and violation of human rights on me.

Prayer:

1.	As I have not even been given a hearing on the subject by any officer of
firm / Enron, I submit the case to your high office for giving me an
opportunity to place before you all the records and other relevant facts and
information.

2.	 I request the above complaint may be investigated by your high office
including an opportunity to me to plead my case as requested herein above
following the concept of natural justice.

3.	I request justice to me and deserving action against the culprits.

For this consideration of yours, I pray always duty bound.

Sincerely yours

Ravi Garg

It really hurts whatever is happening to us (ENRON).  Maybe you and the rest of the management group have thought of this already but I still want to give my suggestion just in case it is not being considered as an option.  Can Enron possibly ask Washington DC (our government) to rescue us.  When I was in Pennsylvania I used to work for a railroad company and that company was in trouble for a while and the government gave help.  Now that Railroad is a private sector and making money and is contributing to the state as well as the local communities.

Subject:	Daily Update


Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

We are very pleased to have you participate in our ""Markets in
Transition"" symposium on January 10, 2001.  I will be sending additional
information to you, but I wanted to give you some ""advance warning"" on a
couple items.

We will be putting together a symposium brochure in December.  As part
of that, we would like to get a biography of you (about 200-250 words in
length), and a photograph.  We will need this by around the first of
December, so I wanted to give you a little advance notice.

I will contact you after Thanksgiving to provide more details around
this event.  If you have any questions in the meanwhile, feel free to

I hope your family enjoys you as much as your extended family here at Enron does.  I've only contributed to Enron for two years but I've always been very proud of Enron and will continue to be proud regardless of what happens long term.

Subject: Change of Control Provisions




As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"Houston Endowment, Corporate Support and TFA-Colorado","Gentleman,
Thanks for your assistance and support at the recent TFA board meeting.

In the good news department we have several items....

1.	Houston Endowment commited $200,000 payable in two installments
(June 2001 and June 2002).  Thanks to Jack Trotter for asisting with this
grant request.

2.	Letters are going out to corporate leaders following the recent
breakfast.  We thank Ken Lay, John Duncan, Scott Yeager and Jack Clark for
their assistance on the letter.  We especially thank John Duncan and Jack
Trotter for their assistance with suggested contribution amounts.
Contributions will go to support TFA activities in Houston and beyond.

3.	I was in Colorado last week.  We have successfully negotiated the
support of the Jared Polis Foundation for Technology For All-Colorado.
Jared Polis  has made a three year commitment totaling approximately
$750,000 to support TFA-Colorado as a  project o the Foundation. Mr. Polis
is a 29 year old entrepreneur who sold the online business of Blue Mountain
cards to Hallmark for around $800 million.  He is very interested in
education and technology issues and has essentially agreed to fund the work
of TFA-Colorado for at least three years as additional community support is
developed.  We will ""co-brand"" the web presence of TFA-Colorado with the
Foundation.

THANKS TO EACH OF YOU....

"Buy Out?","Dear Mr. Lay,
As a former Enron employee who is suffering from the recent Enron stock
price drop I would like to respectfully request that if there's anything you
or anyone can do at Enron to keep Jessie Jackson's hands off of Enron,
please do it.  Jackson is nothing more than a extortionist and the less
anyone has to do with this man the better. I still have my 401 K plus
another 2100 stock options invested.  Maybe it's more than Jackson has, I
don't know, but from my point of view I trust your leadership and don't want
him involved.

If there is anything I can do as an Enron stockholder, please let me know.

As for the buy out, I feel that all of us who own Enron stock will be the
loser since the stock will more likely increase in value much quicker on
it's own...

I was an employee of Enrons for a number of years or until Enron started
bringing in New York Talent such as Phillippe Bibi and his best friend's
Arshak Sarkissian, Lenna Pearlman and the like.  We had an excellent
technology shop and while I was there I built the EDS later to be ETC
trading floor infrastructure.  It worked great but Bibi and Arshak treated
our technical support staff like a bunch of country bumpkins.  I'm
originally from Missouri and made Texas my home and it was just too much to
take the abuse from someone with just a green card.  I know it's too late to
say it now, but Enron lost a lot of great talent since the foreigners took
over.

Best regards,
Ken Booth

"Update on Intelligent Diagnostics","

Dear Shareholders,

Several months have passed since I last told you of the pending sale of
Intelligent Diagnostics Inc (formerly known as askRed.com or DrRedDuke
Inc) to Dynasty Technologies.  Unfortunately, the deal originally
contemplated appears unlikely due to adverse market conditions and
financing difficulties, which seem to be seriously impacting Dynasty's
business just like many other businesses. Dynasty has been shrinking its
operations and moving some of their operation overseas. We are currently
exploring a new business plan with Dynasty that would involve a newly
created company spun off from Dynasty as the principal vehicle for
development of the diagnostic software and related products. Such an
approach may be the best way to proceed.  However, a newly created
entity will face all of the usual problems as any other startup, plus it
will be doing so in a harsh economic environment.

If you have any suggestions, please advise.

I regret that we still have this business in a state of limbo and wish I
could offer some encouraging news based on signs in the marketplace.
I'm sure you are seeing the same bleak outlook that the WEDGE team, Dr.
Casscells and I are encountering as we continue to chase leads for new
sources of funds.

I will send more updates as the possibilities evolve.  Please feel free
to call me at any time....713 332 6856 (office)  713 667 5420 (home).


Sincerely,

Claire

I just wanted to make sure that you knew that someone still believes in what you created.
 
Thank you,
Virginia Cavazos

"Rescheduled -- Management Conference","Ken, Greg and Mark,

I wanted to provide you a suggested agenda for the rescheduled Management Conference.  After working with Joannie Williamson to coordinate open dates on your calendars with hotel availability, here is what we are proposing:

Location:   Westin La Cantera Resort, San Antonio (The Woodlands still will not have enough rooms to hold our group in February.  We are concerned that if we don't have people committed to stay over, especially on a weekend, we risk weak participation.  Also, by rebooking with the Starwood property, we hope to potentially recoup some of the loss incurred by canceling our November date and maintain a positive relationship with the company.)

Dates:   Friday, February 22 and Saturday, February 23 (We received feedback that employees may not appreciate being asked to sacrifice a weekend right now.  However, these are the dates that the hotel is available.  Available dates the previous week would interfere with Valentines Day and coincide with the peak of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.) 

Agenda:	

DAY 1		Friday, February 22

2pm - 5pm	Registration

6pm - 9pm	Reception and Chairman's Dinner
		Speaker:  General Norman Schwarzkopf  (The General is currently available on this date, but has not accepted the engagement.  I feel that, if we can 		reschedule him, he would be a significant draw to ensure people arrive in time for the evening activities.)

DAY 2		Saturday, February 23

8am - 2pm	Business Agenda  (I will keep Ken and the brief business unit presentations/panel on the agenda.  I also hope to reschedule Gary Hamel.  Otherwise, I will		remain flexible on the agenda.)

2pm		Meeting Adjourns

		No planned activities  (The activities are perceived as an unnecessary extravagance at this time.)

We'd like to issue a memo about postponing the Management Conference to invitees as soon as possible.  While details on the agenda can be resolved later, please let me know if you are comfortable with the dates and location so we can include that information in the memo.

Regards,
Terrie James

"Laura Bush","Dear Ken, 
I can understand Mrs. Bush's scheduling dilema.  We will move ahead and look into other speakers and or entertainers for the event with the ability to cancel in order to accomodate Mrs. Bush if she were able to attend.  We, as a committee would love to be able to announce that she is coming, but understand the need for security.  It is our hope and prayer that she would grace us with her presence, her wisdom, and her wealth of informatiom about education. 
I have emailed JHD and given him an idea I have to honor my dad in some way at the event because of his endless support in our school and his grandchildren.  I will let you know more about that as it develops.  My dad knows nothing about it so  I thought I could run it by John and he could give me sound advice.  I have big vision for our school and this community.  My dad taught me that.   
Thank you for everything you are trying to do for us.   
Sincerely, 
Barbara Collins

KEY POINTS: The Second Time Around Still Looks Good.

* ENE has cut another deal on Portland General Electric (PGE), this time with
  Northwest Natural Gas (NWN: $23.04: $1.26 Div-5.46% yield). The deal size is
  $2.955 billion. The original deal, in November 1999, was for $3.1 billion
  with Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP: $15.12: $0.80 Div: 5.29% yield). This was
  $300 mm better than we expected in our September 28 report, which upgraded
  ENE to a Strong Buy.

* This deal has very few externalities, and should close twelve months hence.
  Both companies are Oregon-based, and should get a better regulatory break
  than ENE did when it bought PGE in July 1997.

* The impact on ENE? (1) Very little gain or loss on sale of the assets; (2)
  Interest expense reductions should largely offset expected $140 mm (after
  tax) annual PGE earnings contribution; (3) A better balance sheet, with total
  leverage dropping from 61.9% to 57.3% if done today.

* This is a step in the right direction. PG&E will be in much better hands to
  pursue its Oregon agenda, and ENE will look better without PGE's presence. We
  continue to rate ENE a Strong Buy up to $36; it becomes a Buy from $36 to
  $40. Our 12-month price target is $42-$44.

Current Events:

The deal is straightforward. NWN will raise $1.55 billion in cash, $200 mm in
Feline Prides, and will issue $50 mm in NWN stock to Enron.  NWN will assume the
residual $75 mm obligation inflicted on ENE by the Oregon PUC as the price of
regulatory peace (i.e., ransom demands) at the time of the original acquisition.
This brings the total purchase price to $1.87 billion for PGE's $1.118 billion
of common equity. NWN will assume $1.05 billion of total debt and $29 mm of
straight preferreds. The price-to-book is 167%. PGE has been earning in the $125
mm-$140 mm after-tax area, although the numbers may work higher this year ($150
mm) because of FASB 133 (mark-to-market) profits on longer-dated power trading
of $16 mm being realized (so far). The approximate P/E is about 12.5x forecasts.
The electric group is now trading at 11.5x 01Es and 10.9x 02Es.

The regulatory due process should take about 12 months. There are no looming
rate cases, ROE or capital structure issues. The OPUC ranks very low among state
PUCs in terms of providing fair or competitive ROEs for investors. We were
pleased to learn that the OPUC has finally ditched the CAPM (capital asset
pricing model) as a worthless relic for determining costs of capital and has
embraced discounted cash flow methodology. The bad news was that this still
didn't prevent the OPUC from rolling over PGE in its August 1 rate case
settlement, dropping the allowed ROE from 11.6% to 10.5%. The annualized
earnings impact looks like $8-$9 mm after-tax.

Given the very parochial nature of the Oregon retail energy market, there is no
question in our mind that this should be a worthwhile deal for NWN and a win for
ENE, as well. If the deal were closed today, ENE would deleverage to the tune
of the $2.95 billion proceeds, or from 61.9% to 57.3% total leverage. It would
also trade up ENE's unnecessarily low composite ROE from the 12.5% area to
something better. PGE's secular growth rate is 3%-4% annually in rate base
terms, and its EBIT contribution would run only 8%-9% of ENE's totals in
2002-2003. There would be very little book gain or loss on the sale, and the
$1.4 billion of underlying goodwill on the PGE assets will disappear. ENE had to
reincorporate in Oregon at the time of the PGE purchase. Chances are that it
will be a Delaware corporation by this time next year.

On the other hand, NWN has seized a very good, but highly leveraged opportunity.
Both managements are largely in sync, covering much of the same ground already.
The synergies can be meaningful. NWN's asset base would more than triple, from
$1.29 billion to about $5.65 billion. In essence, NWN's $840 mm rate base will
be joined with PGE's rate base of $1.65 billion, and NWN would have tripled its
rate base to $2.49 billion. About $780 mm of goodwill will be created in the
process. NWN is funding the deal 98% with debt and a mandatory convertible
preferred, and 2% with common equity. It will set up a new upstream corporation,
and presumably do a Section 351 acquisition. The two subsidiaries will then be
merged into ""NewCo"", and that name will be changed back to NWN. NWN's total
capital structure at midyear ran 47.9%-3.6%-48.6% (total debt-preferreds-common
equity). The pro forma structure should run 79.7%-6.9%-13.4%. If short-term debt
is excluded, the structure becomes 77.9%-7.5%-14.6%. Each subsidiary of NewCo
will continue with about 48%-52% leverage, but the parent will look more like an
LBO. Is this bad? We don't think so, because: (1) NWN is buying $140+ mm of
earnings and may pay out about $85 mm-$90 mm in after-tax interest expense, and
thanks to FASB 140-142, there would be no goodwill amortization; (2) Newco will
have almost entirely regulated assets; and (3) the synergies in both G&A and O&M
expenses should be noticeable. The surplus CFFO/ Profitability of (say) $50-$70
mm can be used to pay down the acquisition debt. The good news is that NWN's
earnings should be ramped up significantly as a result of this deal. The
trade-off may be that this is a one-time event, and NewCO will still be subject
to the whims of the OPUC. This should not be underestimated. NWN's realized ROEs
have been about 10.0%-10.5% recently, and PGE's have been in the 12.0%-12.5%
realized range. NWN is expected to grow at 5%-6% annually, and PGE should do
3%-4% annually.

We like the deal fit, the people fit, and the collateral benefits to ENE.

Subject: Aspen
With the possibility of selling house #2, is house #1 off limits?  I  have talked to all of my friends about whether they have purchased their tickets  which they all have.  I have one group going on one trip and another group  going on another all in early 2002.  I will tell my friends to try to  get refunds on their tickets if possible.  I know that even though the  house is on the market there is a chance you will still own it then.
 
However, if number one is available it will solve my January 23- Feb 4  trip, which is three other couples and no kids.  However, the March 6-18 is  three couples and their kids.  I could fit all of them in House 3 as  were planning on doing anyway, but then my family doesn't have anywhere to  stay.  Jessica and Shawn are staying in #1.  If they are not using the  entire house do you think they would mind if only my family stayed with  them.  We would stay in the back house so they wouldn't even know we were  there.  If it imposes on them, by no means would we want to do that.   I could look into putting my family up into a hotel.
 
Anyway, if it doesn't work out it is no big deal, honestly.  I am  truly thankful for all that you and Ken do.  I don't want to inconvenience  anyone, especially you and Ken.  I just want to be fair to my  friends so they can do whatever they need to do to make other arrangements  or try for refunds.
 
Beau

"Please continue to push for additional severance","Dear Mr. Lay,

I went home yesterday along with the other 3,999 employees who lost
their jobs at Enron.  Even though we had weeks to prepare for the worst,
when the layoffs occurred, it really hit me hard.

I cried a great deal, not only about the uncertainty of my future, but
for the loss of relationships and friendships that I had established
over the last five years I spent at Enron.  The hardest aspect of
yesterday was saying ""goodbye"" to my friends and co-workers.

We've all made a resolution to stay in touch and hopefully we will all
pick up the pieces and carry on with our lives.

I appreciate the efforts that were made to get us some severance, but as
you are well aware, gave so much of ourselves to the company and lost so
much in return..

I'm sure I'm not alone in encouraging you and Enron management to
continue to push for additional severance for those of us who lost our
jobs.  This is a hard time to hit the street looking for a job, while
Continential, Compaq and now Enron have downsized and the holidays are
upon us.

I know you have probably received this kind of message  many times in
the last few weeks, but I hope you will continue to do the right thing
for the employees.  We need the additional severance to be able to
ensure food on the table and roofs over our heads until we can land on
our feet after this free fall.

I will never regret my 5 years at Enron.  They are an important part of
my past.

I appreciate your consideration of this request.

Sincerely,

"Invitation","Dear Board Members:

Lekha and I are hosting a Customer Appreciation Dinner at my house and
would like to invite you and your spouse.  The dinner is by special
invitation to our top 100 customers.  It is scheduled the evening of our
Board Meeting, Wed., 24 Oct at 7pm.  The next morning we will have our
Five.Two presentation.  You are invited to attend any of these functions.

Please let me know if you are able to attend.  We would be happy to arrange
any transportation/hotel that you may need.

Regards,
Sanjiv


Below is portion of a sample invitation sent to our customers:

These past few weeks have been an intense time filled with tragedy and
challenge, as well as an amazing spirit that has reminded us of how much we
all have to be thankful.

As you know, we postponed PLANET2001 after consulting with a number of our
customers and partners whose companies have imposed travel restrictions.
The decision to postpone PLANET2001 was an exceedingly difficult one to
make, because so many of us at i2 value the time to meet with our valued
customers. But as we made our plans to postpone PLANET to next spring, we
realized that we had an unprecedented opportunity in front of us right now
an opportunity to say ?thank you? to you -- the very people that have been
our long-term partners and customers.

I would like to personally invite you and your team to an exclusive
recognition event and celebration created for our best customers.  On
October 24th and 25th, if you are free to travel to Dallas, we?d like to
have you join us for i2 Customer Days. With current travel restrictions, I
understand if you cannot join us in person, but I hope you will be able to
join us for the live Webcast on October 25th.

We?ve designed this interactive forum to recognize the world?s best
practice leaders in the industry, to give you the first look at i2?s
exciting new upgrade, and for you to meet and give one-on-one feedback to
our executives and software developers to enhance and improve i2?s
solutions.  In addition, we will host breakout sessions where such
customers as Jacob Scherer, Executive Director of Telcordia Technologies,
and Shane Nicholson, Director of Tokyo Electron, will present their
pioneering work in value chain management.

Starting at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday the 24th, we?d like you to join us for
the official launch of our Ken Sharma Center of Excellence at One i2 Place
where you can hear presentations and meet with i2 product teams. At 4:00,
we?ll break for a special celebration, the Ken Sharma Best Practice Awards,
honoring many of you who have shown the world what it means to be the best
something i2?s late co-founder, Ken Sharma, believed in passionately. Later
that evening, you are invited to join our co-founder and Chairman Sanjiv
Sidhu and his wife Lekha Singh at their home for a private dinner.

The following morning on the 25th, we?d like to give you the opportunity to
preview i2?s breakthrough upgrade i2 Five.Two with an entirely new look and
feel designed for ease of use, as we launch it during the live Webcast
around the world.  We hope you can join us in the afternoon, where you will
have the chance to hear other customers and meet with i2 product teams and
executives.  We?ll finish with a reception later that afternoon.

I do hope you can join us for this special celebration. My assistant,
Corinne Neff, will be taking RSVPs from our guests.  She can be contacted
directly at 469-357-4880 or by email at corinne_neff@i2.com. I look forward
to the opportunity to say thank you for all that you?ve done for i2.

Sincerely,

A. Katrina Roche

I am Marilynne Haws one of your stockholders.  I am 70 years old and was
quite proud of my Enron stock..  Part of the stock I inherited and part I
bought.  I do not have a lot of money, so loosing money is very terrifying
for me.  The dishonesty  of Enron has been a disapointment to me.  I put the
blame entirely on you as you should have been watching the store instead of
politicking.  I still like to believe that in your case it was ego, not
dishonesty that caused you to allow this mess to happen.
I am ashamed of you as l leader of industry, as a Republican and I just hope
that you are not a Methodist.

I can not begin to imagine the weight of your burden, but please know that I and I am sure most employees are behind you 100% and appreciate all you have done and are doing.  I know you will see us through this and am delighted you are there to lead the endeavor.

Are you assuming more responsibility for our low stock price than you should?  Doesn't Ben Graham's Mister Market deserve most of the credit for our recent price swings?  I believe strongly in free markets.  However, for them to work there must be intelligent, well informed buyers and intelligent, well informed sellers operating in good faith.  I am not convinced the U.S stock market has seen many of either over the last three to five years!  My only hope is that the speculators, gamblers, short sellers, etc. all loose their shirts and that Mr. Market finally gets his courage screwed to the hitching post!

Just get us through the exposures we have at our current market cap. and we will be in great shape a few years from now.  

Thanks again and best wishes.

"ENRON - A Study in How So Few Could Screw So Many","Mr. Lay-

After reading the news of your $60,000,000 to $80,000,000 payout, I am disgusted and appalled all over again.  Unfortunately, that's a daily occurrence. 

I have been employed with Enron since May of 1993, when Enron purchased LRC.  I was very skeptical of Enron back then and was unsure of my future with the company.  As time went on, I got more comfortable with the Enron way and learned how to survive and even be a little successful here.  I became a believer in the things Enron could accomplish, a champion of our hard-nosed, driven executives (at least some of them).  I bought Enron stock and held on to those valuable options.

Over the last 18 months, my coworkers and I have viewed the weekly, sometimes daily, selling of Enron stock and exercising of options by our top executives (past and present and including you).  We came up with all kinds of reasons that the executives would be doing this -- they're so overly compensated that they have to cash out some every now and then, divorce settlements, mistress settlements, buying a new home in Aspen, buying an island in the Caribbean, etc., etc. etc....  We never wanted to admit that they knew something we didn't.  Things were great, weren't they?  Jeff Skilling told us that Enron was going to be the ""World's Leading Company.""  He even put the goofy acronyms on his car license plate.  He told us gas traders in February how the stock was going to $126 by the end of the year. Now, being the cynic that I am, I didn't believe the $126, although I have to admit I was hopeful; I figured that if Jeff had the audacity to throw out a number that high, then it was reasonable to expect the stock to be fairly stable, i.e., +/- 20%.  

Needless to say, I didn't sell my stock and didn't exercise any more options.  In fact, I bought more stock when it first started going down.  I'm afraid that there are many more just like me.  I'm fortunate in that I have many working years ahead of me (where, I don't know) to try to build up my savings again.  Many others are not that fortunate.  So many have spent their entire careers here, helping to build this company up.  They were looking forward to retiring soon and enjoying the fruits of their labor.  And let me remind you that their retirement accounts were in many cases a lot less than a month's compensation for you.  Now even that is essentially gone.  Other employees were just ready to cash in some of their options to pay for their children's college tuition.  The stories are too numerous to list, and the more I think about it, the more sickened I become.

It is painfully obvious to me and my coworkers, as well as the rest of the industry and Houston, that Enron's executives knew that there were skeletons in the closet and began cashing in ahead of this freefall.  The employees and the rest of the world were fed a bunch of half-truths and mystery mumbo-jumbo.  There should be an accounting for this behavior.  You and your cohorts have ruined so many lives.  Think about that while you're spending your millions.....

"Enron Prize","
Ken,

I wanted to let you know that I spoke with W.O. King at the Baker Institute earlier today.  Everything is ready for tomorrow's activities.

There will be a great deal of media coverage for the event.  Many media outlets will be accessing the live video feed of Chairman Greenspan's speech.  However, the media will not be able to interview any participants directly.  Chairman Greenspan will only answer written questions submitted by the audience (including media), and those questions will be vetted twice.  I will be receiving the media advisory that has been distributed and the most current media attendee list from the Baker Institute tomorrow.  I will provide that to you as early as possible. 

You probably know that, because of his position, Chairman Greenspan can not accept the prize itself, but only the ""honor"" of being named an Enron Prize recipient.  For that reason, the Enron Prize will not be present on stage during the ceremony.  

Karen Denne, Christie Patrick and I will be attending.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information prior to the event.

See you there,
Terrie

"Laura Bush","Dear Mr. Lay, 
      It was so wonderful to see you and Linda at the party on Sat. night.   
We had such a great time seeing so many friends.  My dad had a good time as  
well.  He said it was the latest he has stayed out in a long time, and for a  
good reason.  He has such wonderful friends.   
      I want to thank you for considering helping me in acheiving my goal  
which is to get Laura Bush to speak at a fund raiser for our school.  The  
event will be in April; of course depending on her schedule this can change,  
but we have reserved the Snowmass Conference Center for the 19th.  This is a  
great celebration for us and for education.  If you watch our video I am  
sending for your viewing you will understand what we have been through just  
to have the right to keep our doors open. We settled with Pitkin County  
several years ago on a Supreme Court ruling by Judge Madge in our favor.  We  
were able to use those funds to build our current building.  We will be  
making a new video for the gala that will include our high school.  The  
current video was made two years ago when we decided to embark upon high  
school.   
      I know you understand the draw Mrs. Bush would have at such an event.   
It would be very meaningful for us if she could attend the celebration.  I  
appreciate anything you could do that would encourage her to come.  I hope  
you and Linda will keep this time open on your busy schedules and attend.  We  
are hoping to set into place endowment and educational chairs that will  
secure the future of our school. I may have mentioned our next endeavor we  
see in our future would be to open the school up for others across the  
country to come and take advantage of the beautiful surroundings as well as  
the christian education.  We will have host families that will house the  
students at first until we can absorb them perhaps as boarders.  We know God  
is in charge and He will direct our path in this possibility. 
      I did not get the chance to also tell you how grateful we are as a  
school for Technology for All.  Our little school was the test pilot and the  
first out of state set up and delivery.  Of course, I told them that if I had  
to drive to Texas to get them I would and that is just what we did on one of  
our Spring Breaks.  We loaded up a UHaul and drove 15 computers back to  
Basalt for our state of the art computer lab.  We have a wonderful man who  
has networked them all  We are modem, cd rom and internet compatable now.  We  
have just received more for each of our high school classrooms from the   
office in Denver.  The fruit of your labor is prospering and we are so  
thankful.  We probably have one of the best computer labs in the valley. 
      Thank you again for your consideration.  Please share the video with  
Linda.  I know she will get a kick out of seeing William in action.  He truly  
has a gift at what he does.  We are proud to be a part of such wonderful  
work.  I will send the video today with some more info on the school.  Give  
our regards to Bo and David.  We think of them often and always glad to see  
them when we do in Aspen.  May God continue to bless all that you put your  
hand to, indeed!

"11 September","Dear Ken,

As an Enron employee in the UK I would like to say thank you for taking the trouble of writing personally to your employees.

The events of 11 September have shocked the world and forced our governments to take very difficult and far reaching decisions.  As somebody from the UK I would like to say how we support President Bush and admire his handling of the very difficult decisions which have had to be made.  We are pleased that Prime Minister Blair has totally backed these decisions and offered support.

On a personal note we have friends in Boston and our concern for them highlighted the close bond between our two countries.  The American citizens stranded in Britain at that time felt supported in their loss, grief and bewilderment.  Our Queen took the initiative of the Horse Guards playing 'The Star Spangled Banner' and a melody of American tunes which was very emotional.  The Archbishop of Canterbury said some inspired words regarding the Statue of Liberty and all that it stands for.

Your position at Enron is at the top, mine is miniscule but we both want to say God Bless America.

Regards

"RE:","Ken,

Thank you for your response to my email.  Whether you actually took the
time to respond or left it to one of your assistants, I hope you read my
comments/suggestions and truly understood them.

I have a few more comments and suggestions!

You are correct, overall stock values have declined and Enron has some
additional, unique issues related to its broadband and tele-com
business, payments from California and large investments in foreign
power plants, particularly India.  However, I cannot agree with your
comments (or Jeff's) about short sellers.

Short sellers, like jackals and vultures, exist for a reason and are an
important part of the whole financial community in which we live.  Short
sellers (and Jackals) are always looking for a deal(meal).  When they
find an unhealthy company (animal), they investigate, which oftens leads
to greater opportunities.  Enron, under Jeff's leadership, was not
healthy and the short sellers (jackals) found a wonderful opportunity.

Your current job, as was Jeff Skilling's, is to not provide the short
sellers (jackals) a reason or opportunity to focus on Enron's stock
price.

I applaud your recent commitment to the financial community to provde
better definition regarding Enron's profits.  Developing the necessary
internal mechanism for a largely transparent financial reporting system
will police itself and will ultimately reinforce confidence in Enron's
true value.

As an economist, you need to remember that the market value of any
company, in today's economy, is largely based on the market's perception
of its value. As you and I have so recently seen, the market very often
reacts on preception and only looks at intrinsic value as an
afterthought.  The financial community believes that if it quacks like a
duck and walks like a duck, then....just maybe it is a duck and not
really a racehorse

Enron executives need to be more cognizant of the negative impact their
excessive insider selling of shares has on market preception.  Using
stock options in lieu of salary is a very powerful incentive but it can
also backfire, especially if the proper safe guards are not in place.
Excessive insider trades can and should be limited.

Doing good things for the right reasons works! For some years now,
Northern's leadership has not done many good things for the right
reasons.  They are highly political and have developed a nasty habit of
not telling their upper management (Stan Horton) the truth, but what
Stan wants to hear.  They are doing many things, not because they
should, but becaue they can get away with them.  This activity works
only as long as their customers do not have a choice!  You want
examples-look at the non-Enron pipeline activity in Florida and the
upper midwest.

A solid domestic asset with a reasonable return is much better than the
possibility of much higher returns on assets in unstable, foreign
markets.  Enron is not smarter than the world and the world has
certainly demonstrated that it will not allow Enron to possess very much
control over world affairs.  Let's learn from our mistakes!

Selling difficult assets, such as in India, is good.  Selling profitable
assets, such as Portland General is bad just to make the bollom line
revenue. Warren Buffet, an Omaha native, does not look like such an old
fuddy-duddy as he once did, as recently as last year.  Strong, solid
fandamentals do count and ......

Short sellers will always be around and DOING GOOD THINGS FOR THE RIGHT
REASONS truly works!!!

Sincerely,

Neal Shaw

Neal:

I appreciate your recent e-mail concerning the decline in Enron's stock
price.  I share with you a very deep disappointment and frustration
about
this decline.

The decline has occurred for a number of reasons.  First, overall stock
values have declined significantly this year.  Enron's stock price has
declined more than averages primarily because of the total melt down in
the
broadband and tele-com business, difficulties with getting paid by the
California utilities and trouble with our large power plant and LNG
project
in India.  These problems have been further compounded by endless
misinformation and rumors, probably promulgated by short sellers.

In any event, I believe we our making progress in addressing these
various
problems.  I believe our stock price will increase over the short to
intermediate term.  With good success, we will be able to restore most
or
all of the value we lost this year over the not too distant future.

I appreciate your concerns and your suggestions and I will certainly do
everything I can to restore your confidence in Enron.

Sincerely,

Ken

   Ken,

   My name is Neal Shaw and I worked for Northern Natural Gas Company in
   Midland, Minneapolis and Omaha in the Marketing Department of Enron's
   Gas Pipeline Group for almost 19 years.  I left the company is
December
   2000. I have a major portion of my investment portfolio in Enron
shares.

   I just read an interesting article titled Sizing up CEO aplomb under
   duress a major concern. by Jamie Lareau.  This article focused on how
to
   recognize CEO's and CEO candidates who were not up to the
requirements
   of their job and used Jeff Skilling as an example.  I have agreed
with
   views of this journalist for some time, especially since Jeff called
a
   fund manager an ""asshole"".  Publically calling someone is simply Not
   something any CEO should do and you and Enron's board should have
done
   something about Jeff then.

   My point is as follows:  Where were you and the Enron Board during
all
   this?  Why have you let people like Jeff Skilling and Stan Horton
   virtually destroy all growth prospects for the pipelines and totally
   concentrate on trying to make money without an asset base?  A lot of
   people believed Jeff's hype and many people have suffered!  Has Jeff
   suffered?.  I think not especially since he has left Enron with
millions
   of our dollars in his pocket.  Hopefully he will be able to afford
the
   time off to ""find himself"".

   Did you see the movie ""Top Gun""?  Toward the end of the movie, Tom
   Cruise, otherwise know as Maverick, blamed himself for the loss of
his
   friend and simply disengaged from combat flying.  However, when
things
   got really rough, Maverick re-engaged the enemy and did what he was
   hired to do.

   Do you know where this is going?

   You are once again Enron's ""Top Gun""!  The enemy is Enron's depressed
   stock price.  It is time for you to re-engage and live up to your
title
   of ""Top Gun"" and CEO!  I and the rest of Enron's stock holders need
you
   to repair the damage Jeff did and STOP the damage people like Stan
   Horton are currently doing and get Enron back in the mix.

   I sincerely hope you are still capable of doing a good job.  If you
are
   not, refund your salary since Jeff took over and step down.

   Sincerely,

"Update on Retirement","Ken: 
I am writing to seek coming back to Enron.  I chose retirement in April this year at age 57 because we all thought the stock was going to $120 or thereabouts. We know what happened. 
I was your VP of Engineering for EE&CC under Larry Izzo. 
You might remember me, we last met at your Marco Polo awards dinner, my wife, Brenda, was the one in the Red wheelchair talking with Mr. Kissinger. 
I could help bring some intellectual capital back to Enron and help the company succeed.  My resume is attached. 
I appreciate any consideration you can make. 
Thanks,

"Heartfelt Appreciation - Biography","Ken, Enron Corp was a great empire that found itself vulnerable -- the same as the World Trade Center -- the same as our country's security.  The cost of exposure has been high but a cheap price to pay in the long run for our future generations.  I see Enron in the future.

I have known many great men personally, including Dr. Thomas D. Cronin, the inventor of breast implants (originally invented for breast reconstruction), and William Oldenburg, owner of the LA Express USFL football team, a self-made billionaire, who made and lost  and remade his billions three times.  Although I have yet to have the pleasure of personally knowing you, I have come to know your character.  I believe you will go down in history as one of the great leaders of our times.

Ken, I am a writer and would deeply appreciate if you would authorize me to write your biography (if not all, perhaps through this transition).  I promise that this biography will receive the same standard of excellence you expect from all your employees.  

Please let me know as soon as possible.  There is a lot of work to be done.

Sincerely yours,

"401k from DSG","
Mr. Lay,

A group of former DSG employees have tried to receive information about the status of our DSG 401k's.  We were promised that our accounts would be super-vested and then moved to Enron's 401k plan.  We expected this change to take at the most 6 months.  It has been two years...  We were told on several occasions that our accounts had been super-vested and we were waiting on Enron to move the accounts.  We are now being told that our AUL accounts can not be moved and in fact are frozen.  Marla Barnard was our HR representative at the time of the acquisition.  She has directed my questions to Mike Rath in Benefits, who has never responded.  Can someone please explain why the super-vesting and moving of the funds did not occur, the rules associated with the account freeze and why we are not receiving our statements from AUL?

I did not receive any info from Mikie Rath.  Does this mean that I can not borrow from my AUL 401k?  The majority of my money (11 years) came from Amoco not DSG.  Does that matter?

Debbie, I forwarded this message to Mikie Rath in benefits - did you get a response?  If not, I do have some info. I can provide, but she would need to assist you with any particular details.  Please see below - I just learned recently that it does not appear much of this info. was communicated to DSG employees after the acquisition.

1- The assets contained within the DSG 401(k) plan cannot be transferred to the Enron plan because the plan was never authorized by the IRS.
	
2- Prior DSG employees cannot transfer funds out of the AUL 401(k) into a self directed IRA, because Enron purchased the assets of DSG. Therefore termination applies to Enron employment, not employment by DSG in regards to transfer of said assets to a self directed account.
	
3- The DSG plan with AUL will remain intact and Enron will pay all associated administrative fees until all employees represented by the plan are no longer in employed by Enron

	4- Since the plan is frozen, vesting service should continue to accrue as long as the employee remains with Enron.  Only if the plan is terminated does ""super vesting"" occur.  The purchase agreement may have assumed that the plan was going to be terminated which could explain that language.

 Marla  ,

I am a former employee of DSG.  We were purchased by Enron, Dec. of  1999 .  We were promised that our 401K's would be moved to Enron's 401k plan.  This has never happened.  I no longer receive AUL (401k company) statements.  AUL claims that it sends the statements to the administrator of the plan at Enron.  I would really like to transfer my money to Enron's 401k or at least receive a statement of my account at AUL.


Thanks!

"Awesome Speech!","Ken,

Thanks for putting the issues in perspective for all of us - i.e., it is not the lack of adversity, but rather one's response to adversity, that makes one great and builds one's character.  From what you said, it sounds like Enron has faced (with integrity) some serious adversity in the past and rallied admirably - certainly no reason to think the same will not happen this tough time.  Keep steering the boat - we'll all get through this!!  

Thanks and God Bless You!

AIG's surety exposure is approximately $132 million.  It is all related to a tax exempt prepay done a couple of years ago.  Obviously, we will not be able to collateralize their exposure.

There appears to be only one bond provided by AIG,  APEA - Nebraska on which AIG holds 50%.  Chubb has the other 50%.  The exposure is one of Joe Deffner's and has a declining balance.  It was originally written for $300,000,000 and is now at approximately $264,000,000.  50% of that number is consistent with AIG's  November 21, 2001, demand for collateral of $131,537,271.

"""Outside the Box"" Employee Morale Idea","Although I realize it is likely too late, an alternative to forgoing the incentive clause under your employment agreement would be to instead accept the $60 million, and set up a lottery for Enron employees in which 30 winners would each win $2 million (or some variant, i.e. 10 winner for $6m, 120 for $500k etc.).  

This could be done for employees of record at the time of the merger.

The idea clearly has pros and cons, but on the whole I feel would create some positive news for people to focus on in this difficult time.  It would certainly be a non-traditional and positive way to close the Enron era.

AEI Conference
What Should the Government Do about the Transition to Digital Television?

Friday, October 26, 2001, 9:30 a.m.-Noon
Wohlstetter Conference Center, Twelfth Floor, AEI
1150 Seventeenth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

In 1997, the Federal Communications Commission determined that the deployment of digital television was in the public interest.  Since its official launch in November 1998, consumer demand has been slow to develop and numerous technical and practical problems have arisen, leading commentators to call it a ""transition in trouble.""  Despite all this, the issue has received limited attention in Washington, and there has been little public debate to frame the FCC's decisions throughout the transition period.  This conference brings together speakers of various backgrounds who are involved in the transition and aims to further an informed debate on the role of government in the transition to digital television.

Dr. Lay,
       
       I just wanted to communicate my disappointment with the events over the last couple weeks here at Enron.  After having graduated from 
University eight months ago I was elated to start work at the ""World's leading company"" and saw the opportunity to learn a great deal about the natural-gas industry and guaranteed entry into a top MBA program.  Yesterday, I was told that my employment had been terminated with Enron.  In hindsight I made the wrong decision to work here.  

  I find it unbelievable that a Fortune 500 company can collapse as rapidly as Enron did!  I sympathise with workers who have families to support and the many foreign nationals who will have to return home due to visa problems.  I find it unbelievable that a few executives at the top can enrich themselves( you included) with the exercising of hundreds of millions of dollars in options and yet the vast majority of people have suffered terrible financial pain through vanished stock options and 401 k plans.  However, I believe ultimately justice will come to fruition.  Reputations have been destroyed which in my opinion is more important to any amount of money or financial gain.  Without integrity a person has nothing!
 
On the bright side when I ultimately attend Business school I will have had first hand experience with the Enron case study.  Again, I am very disappointed with the handling of the situation and have lost much respect for the company and its management.  Nevertheless, it has been a great educational experience on how not to handle such a situation!

"SF Gate: Enron's secret bid to save deregulation/PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians","FYI, the only people who knew who we invited to the meeting (but did not attend) were Dick Riordan and Kevin Sharer...


Saturday, May 26, 2001 (SF Chronicle)
Enron's secret bid to save deregulation/PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers


   Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly
courted Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other
luminaries this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution
to California's energy crisis.
   His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and
federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.
   Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign
contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at
the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.
   Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham
Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in
1990 and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star
Schwarzenegger;
   and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have
been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.
   One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be
identified, said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting
participants to support Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who
are trying to solve the state's energy mess.
   PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
   The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is
concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with
power markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government
authority to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last
week to create and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and
run power plants in California.
   ""They're trying to rescue deregulation,"" the source said of Enron
executives. ""They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.""
   At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position
paper titled ""Comprehensive Solution for California,"" which was obtained
by The Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the
billions in debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that
investigations of power price manipulation and political rhetoric are
making matters worse.
   The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway
electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power
generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by
regulators and economists.
   One of the talking points read: ""Get deregulation right this time --
California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers.""
Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving
electricity.
   INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
   Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and
was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment
with a competitive power market system.
   Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially
produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from
generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this
year, Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.
   Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for
Enron, said she would ""look into that"" and then did not return repeated
telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at
the meeting.
   D.C. CONNECTIONS
   Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached
unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times,
Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs
regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story
also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not
support Lay's desire to further deregulate the nation's electricity
system. Lay denied the allegation.
   Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief
executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of
Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant
Amgen.
   Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles
Lakers star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton
supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's
first civilian space trip.
   Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but
declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for
comment through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday
afternoon.
   A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor
attended,
   but was ""not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this
issue.
   His intent is to listen to all sides.""
   Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to
Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support
Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source
who participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal
and asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his
agenda.

review the activities and Building needs of the College of Biblical Studies.
I think you got a good picture of an organization with tremendous impact on
our City and our society, yet is relatively unknown in the business

contribution and the potential Honorary Chair we discussed could be pivotal
in bringing this unique Houston Institution into public view.  I can't think
of another way to bring disparate cultures together more meaningfully, than
to share a common belief in Christ.  We look forward to your prayerful
consideration of our requests.

On another topic, I can't tell you how pleased I was to meet your son.  He
is a wonderful man that you should be quite proud of.  Bonnie and I have  14

-------------------------------------------------------------

NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS LIKELY TO FEED GOVERNMENT GROWTH

Military and economic crises have been the twin engines propelling
the growth of American government, as politicians have rushed through
new spending programs and regulations to show the public that they
were ""doing something."" When the crises passed, however, government
didn't revert to its pre-crisis size. Instead, the expansions created
new baselines for further government growth, according to Independent
Institute senior fellow Robert Higgs in his book CRISIS AND LEVIATHAN.

This ""ratchet effect"" is of special concern in the aftermath of the
Sept. 11th attacks, as Congress gave the executive branch broad
powers intended to fight terrorism and prop up a faltering economy,
according to Higgs in an interview with REASON Magazine.

""When the government takes large-scale, unprecedented actions of this
sort, unanticipated consequences always occur,"" says Higgs. ""Then the
government has to expand even further to deal with those
consequences.""

""The ultimate result will be an enlargement of the Big Brother state.
We were moving that way already. This will accelerate it,"" Higgs
concludes.

http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink3-38-1.html.

-------------------------------------------------------------

HOW THE FEDS MISREPRESENTED ANTI-PRIVACY PROVISIONS OF 1994 LAW

Congress is now contemplating passage of the Mobilization Against
Terrorism Act, which would (among other things) expand government
wiretapping and eavesdropping powers.

Unknown to most Americans, however, is that Congress had already
given law enforcement authorities broad powers to expand electronic
surveillance in the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act (CALEA), according to political economist Charlotte
Twight in the fall 2001 issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.

Among other powers, the CALEA gave the Federal Bureau of
Investigation authority to track the physical location of cell phone
users and to obtain the content of private communications in a
variety of circumstances without a probable-cause warrant. Yet when
testifying to Congress about the proposed CALEA, the FBI's
then-director Louis Freeh repeatedly claimed that CALEA would confer
no new authority on law enforcement officials, provide no information
about the physical location of cellular phone calls, and not weaken
existing privacy protections.

The CALEA episode, argues Twight, demonstrates that Congress is no
match for crafty machinations of bureaucrats expert in masking their
true intentions by hamstringing Congress's ability to understand the
meaning of new legislation -- what Twight calls an example of the
manipulation of ""political transaction costs,"" such as the cost of
understanding the details of legislation.

""The confluence of CALEA, federally mandated electronic databases of
personal information, Carnivore, Digital Storm, Echelon, and the like
have established a web of federal surveillance never before known in
the United States,"" writes Twight.

""One way or another, we will soon learn that the
resistance-inhibiting power of broad-based government surveillance is
potentially the most liberty-endangering form of political
transaction-cost manipulation confronting Americans -- and
freedom-loving people everywhere -- in the new millennium.""

for Law Enforcement Act"" by Charlotte Twight (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW,

THE DRUG WAR ON TRIAL: Independent Policy Forum Transcript Now Available

Many public officials fear political reprisals if they speak out
against the ""War on Drugs,"" but judges James Gray (Orange County,
Calif., Superior Court) and Vaughn Walker (U. S. District Court, San
Francisco, Calif.), not only testified against it at the recent
Independent Policy Forum, ""The Drug War on Trial: Two Judges Speak
Out,"" they also explained why an increasing number of judges are
joining them.

Judge Gray began by explaining how his years as a criminal prosecutor
led him to write his recent book, WHY OUR DRUG LAWS HAVE FAILED AND
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. Despite the vast sums poured into drug
interdiction and prosecution, Judge Gray explained, he observes that
drugs are no harder to obtain today than when he was prosecuting drug
cases. Further, drugs today are often more dangerous because
anti-smuggling efforts and anti-marijuana laws have led drug dealers
to supply drug users with more potent drugs.

Judge Walker explained that the growing number of judges opposing the
Drug War are diverse in their political orientation and career
experience. But, he said, the judges cannot be the sole advocates of
sensible drug-law reform -- citizens in every walk of life must
become better informed about the Drug War's tremendous economic,
social and health costs, and voice their objections in public.

Is serious reform possible on so emotional a topic? Yes, measured
optimism is warranted, according to the judges. Just as communism in
Eastern European collapsed quickly and unexpectedly, so may the War
on Drugs, as Americans learn of better approaches to dealing with
drug abuse, such as those practiced in Switzerland, Judge Gray
concluded.

"Probably too late... but Why not.","Why not get more into the Alternative Energy Program.   I know we have the Enron Wind <http://www.wind.enron.com/> website..... Maybe we should promote it more.  

The world in my opinion, is ready for alternative energy on a BIG scale.  If we make some sort of announcement ""press release""  supporting the WIND POWERING AMERICA <http://www.eren.doe.gov/windpoweringamerica/> project, the news would be a positive and ""new and different"" businessmen would sit up and listen.  

I think we should have platforms in the oceans that support windmills.  I know saltwater erodes pipeline but we move oil thru it, why not electricity.  Surely we have a better conductor cable that will hold the power and carry it to longer distances now.  I know that is a problem because the further electricity is moved, the weaker it gets.  I think people would be more open to platforms holding turbines instead of pumpers.

Moving more in the direction of Alternative Energy will give us tax credits and ""favor"" (which we need) with the government.

The government says they will finance projects, so hold them to it.  Put them on the spot by making an announcement of moving forward in that direction.

Enron should be listed on the websites below, but I didn't see us.  Why?

<http://www.crest.org/cgi-bin/gem/gem.pl>
<http://www.webdirectory.com/Science/Energy/>
<http://www.webdirectory.com/Science/Energy/Alternative_Energy/Wind_Energy/>

We should be linked to all alternative energy websites.

HEADLINE OF THE FUTURE

ENRON turning the world around to cleaner air!

NOTE:  If you deside to start something new and you need any help, let me know.  Donna Muniz  <mailto:silvermoon@wcnet.net>I think you built a wonderful company.... I just think the ""times"" hurt us.

God Bless

"PERSONAL -- What Enron has meant for me.","Dear Dr. Lay: I have worked for 4 years in Enron and wanted to share what working at your company has meant to me.

Enron has been a life changing experience.  A positive life changing experience!  I wish that it wasn't all ending this way (as I am sure you are) but even knowing what I know now, I would still have joined Enron.  I like many people in Enron have come from much smaller, provincial companies that had a more traditional culture.  While they may been more stable, they never would have presented the high quality work opportunities that Enron did.  I have become a more employable and confident person because of Enron.  While there were some aspects of the company's culture and practices that I found questionable, there's no question that my life will be better because I joined your company.  Enron gave me a chance to escape a mediocre professional life and allowed me to realize what I am capable of -- and many companies can't lay claim to that.  I don't know what my immediate future holds-- but I'm sure it will be better than if I had stayed with my old employer.   Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

I'm sure these are trying days for you and I sense that the work you are doing now is more of a labor of love than any type of obligation.  Good luck in the future.  

Best Regards,
VV Rao,
Director, Origination,
Global LNG Group

"Rebuild","Dear Ken:

I am very sad to see what has happened to such a big icon in Houston.  I am very sorry to see you struggle through this and try to remain at a high level.  I am very pleased to see you chose to stay with the company and work at what I hope is its new birth and positive rise in society and business community.

I had a chance to meet with you a little over a year ago at a charity function.  While I am no expert in the energy business and I'm but a college student at the present time, I would like to share a view from the other side of the inner loop your used to.   Before I met you everyone I spoke with had nothing but wonderful things to say about you and what a genious you are.  After the news came out about the misfortune of Enron, some of those same people started bad mouthing some of the same people they praised.   It made me sick and made me think very little of those individuals.  I was concerned because I could not believe that you would intentionally and knowingly do something that would jeopardize the very company you helped build.  The day I saw you make the decision to not leave or step down as CEO I knew then that you must not have been directly involved in the coverup done by your previous COO and a couple of other top executives you had entrusted.   Those few people,!
 one of which you had recently hired, all quit just before the news came out about Enron bookkeeping.

I feel safe in saying you must have been misadvised by those few people or you did not know what they were doing behind your back.  It is obvious they were not working for Enron like you, but rather ""at"" Enron to try to steal as much money and benefites they could and then head for the hills, which is what they did.   The mere act of having several top executives quit working at Enron after a short stay at the company and then cashing out on their holdings tells me it was intentional and I consider them thieves.  It would be a different story had they stayed like you and really cared about the company and what it represents and does for society as a whole.

I feel very sorry for those investors and employees who have been devestated by what has happened. BUT, it makes me very angry to hear people and writers casting stones on you and a company that has done so much over the past several years for so many.   Enron has funded more charity events and backed more functions and elections than most.  Now when the tide has turned and (due to a few greedy top executive decisions) Enron is in the position of needing help, everyone is out for blood and looking to end a company that still represent the same work it did before, but whose value has decreased because of word of mouth and the stupid greed of your previous employees.

Some people I have talked with say Enron is finished and is only a matter of time before it is gone.  That makes me angry too.  From what I see you have not given up on the company nor have you abandoned ship.  That tells me you may be trying to rebuild the company and its reputation.   That would be the greatest thing to do and show those who are out for Enrons demise (and who can do nothing but bad mouth) just what your really made of and put them in their place.  I have been reading nothing but negative articles about the company.   I feel like it is not the company, because that would mean every single employee would be to blame.  Rather the writers should focus on the few individuals who cashed out and split.

I would hope you could remember back 4 or 5 years ago when the company was really thriving and doing well.  I hope you can remember the good things about the company and the fact that it can still (and does) make money from its businesses.  It can turn around if you want it to.   I would hope you can make the trading business and other companies held by Enron what it once was without having to sell off too many of the future profitable ones and make use of the two beutiful buildings now towering over Houston's skyline.  I call those Houston's twin towers.

Other large companies in the past have turned around after similar set backs as horrible as this with Enron.  Your turn around would be record setting.  I heard about others (like the teachers retirement fund) making noise about wanting to take Enron to court because they invested millions.   That is stupid because it is their choice to invest and their risk to take, especially making it after the news broke about the company.  Sure they trusted that Dynegy would merge, so perhaps their frustration should be aimed at Dynegy or perhaps use their collective educated minds together to help find a way to turn Enron around and make their investment purposful rather than throwing stones.

I think Dynegy is a wonderful company as well, but it ""was mean"" for them to come out and say ""yes they would merge"" and then not.  I realize it's all business and people like to make money, but it's another thing to flat steal and lie (like your executives you trusted did) rather than profit from hard work and honesty.

I personally know of many large corporations and politicians who have things to hide that would cause problems like yours.  Your company is not alone, which is why I am so angry at others throwing stones at you and Enron.  This would not happen if there were'nt executives in corporate industries like the ones you entrusted your company to who try to take rather than give and earn from it.   Perhaps many should learn from Colleen Barrett, COO of Southwest Airlines.  Do you know that they are the only airlines to refuse federal aid recently and they are doing better then most airlines.

Good luck and thank you for hanging in there and making me believe there are still some good top CEO's out there.

"Message from Commissioner Tony Garza","TO: Friends of Tony Garza 
FROM: Tony Garza 
RE: Houston Mayor's Race - The Home Stretch 
Orlando Sanchez is locked in a tough run-off election, and he needs your help now to cross the finish line strong and become Houston's next mayor. 
In case you haven't heard, both Presidents Bush have endorsed Orlando for Mayor, and HUD Secretary Mel Martinez and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao will be in Houston to help campaign for Orlando.  That's all great news for the Sanchez Campaign, but what will matter most is that Houstonians turn out at the polls this Saturday and help Orlando finish strong and finish first! 
If you're a Houstonian, your vote, your financial support and your volunteer efforts are needed most.  Remember, the election is THIS SATURDAY (12/1/01). 
The rest of us can lend a hand to Orlando Sanchez by making a contribution to his campaign today and by encouraging our friends, family and business associates in Houston to go to the poll and cast a vote for real leadership for America's fourth largest city! 
Please take a moment right now and make a contribution to Orlando's campaign online at https://www.campaigncontribution.com/donors_info.asp?id=1932&db=1 .  Or, mail your contribution to Orlando Sanchez Campaign, 3100 Timmons Lane, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77027. 
Or, equally important, volunteer to help Orlando turn out the vote.  Jump to the ""Get Involved"" 
section of his web site at http://www.orlandosanchez.com/get_involved.htm . 
Please forward this message along to as many of your friends, family and co-workers as possible.  The run-off election is just a few short days away.  Please do what you can to help ensure Orlando finishes strong and finishes first on December 1.

"RE: Houston Christian Business Group--January Notice","Gentlemen,

In keeping with our tradition, please come to tomorrow's breakfast meeting
prepared to write down some of your New Year's resolutions, seal them in an
envelope (which will be provided) so that they can be mailed to you
mid-year.  I suggest dividing resolutions into categories that are
spiritual, mental, physical and social.

Under ""spiritual"" examples of resolutions could be daily prayer time and
Bible reading or attending certain classes or reading certain books to gain
in Christian maturity.  You may even want to set a goal of mentoring a
younger Christian as they develop in the faith.

I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

"Thank You","Last night when I left the Enron Building, once again I was so very depressed thinking that another executive was taking millions of dollars away from Enron and leaving the employees to fend for ourselves.   

On the way home I heard your announcement on the radio that you were not going to exercise that part of your contract.   Thank you for restoring my faith in Enron.   I truly appreciate the sacrifice you are making and thank you for thinking about the employees.

I have been with Enron for 23 years and I would never have believed this could happen.   I have always given 100% to this company and I'm crushed that I will not be here much longer.  My first choice would be to stay with Enron but at this time I think that is unrealistic and I am searching outside.  Enron has been my home and my family for these 23 years.   

I just wanted to say thank you again for all that you have done for us.

"Quick update:  status of the Xcelerator","Ken,

As you'll recall, during the September 10th advisory board meeting, we discussed the need for strong, senior-level support to ensure an opportunity for Xcelerator's success.  At the conclusion of the meeting, we agreed you and Greg Whalley would discuss the support level with the Management Committee on the 13th.  Of course, the sad events of the 11th understandably delayed that timeline.

Since September 10th, I've revisited the Xcelerator with several members of the Management Committee including Louise Kitchen, John Lovorato, Jim Fallon, John Sheriff, and Andy Fastow.  In summary, they are supportive contingent on support from you and Greg.  Additionally, other Xcelerator board members are supportive - specifically Jeff Donahue and Kevin Garland - but all agree the sincere support from you and Greg will be necessary for success.

Greg Whalley and I have also discussed the Xcelerator on two occasions.  Greg is concerned that I will be unable to attract good talent from within Enron to this ""risky"" initiative, especially given the trajectory of the economy and scarcity of new jobs within the company.  I agree with him.  Greg asked if I would try the Xcelerator understanding that most if not all of the full-time team members would need to be hired from the outside.  Although not optimal, I think it is doable and told him I'd be willing to proceed under those circumstances.  While Greg was quite supportive, he was appropriately distracted by the upcoming board meeting and close of the quarter.  As a result, he and I are planning on discussing the future of the Xcelerator this Tuesday.  (Of course, the earnings announcement may delay that discussion to next week.)

As I mentioned in the Xcelerator's board meeting, I am excited about this opportunity and am committed to giving it my all, with the support of the senior team.  This effort could create tremendous value for Enron.  However, I have no delusions about how difficult it will be and the patience it will require.  If we are successful over '02, we will definitely create value for our shareholders, but are almost certain to be a drag on earnings -- albeit a small one.  If you and Greg are not able to be supportive, then let's acknowledge that and discontinue the Xcelerator's operations.  As we discussed on the 10th, lukewarm senior support will not be sufficient for success.

I do hope to have the opportunity to make this a success for Enron.  Alternatively, if you choose not to proceed with this effort, I would be excited to consider other opportunities to grow a business within Enron.  If no such opportunity exists, then I am happy to have had this opportunity.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this matter further.

Sincerely,

Heath

Theatre Under the Stars so we can produce the world class productions you
have become accustom to here in Houston from Theatre Under the Stars.

Please don't hesitate to call your friends and tell them to save the date

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

10/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.

The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 

On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management.""

BARRON'S: REVIEW & PREVIEW

Turning Up the Heat: 

Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO, Andrew S. Fastow. Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence. Enron shares have plunged 50% recently, after it announced the probe and reported a $618 million loss.

Bulls Look To Recovery, As Techs Lead The Surge 
By Andrew Barry 


-- In what undoubtedly will become a business-school case study, Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a full-blown financial crisis last week. 

Enron's stock plunged 10.60 to 15.45, following a 10-point drop in the prior week, and the company's bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around 10%. By week's end, Enron had drawn down $3 billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly $2 billion in maturing commercial paper, leaving it only about $1 billion of net liquidity. 

Enron's big energy trading operation, which accounts for the bulk of the company's profits and most of its equity valuation, now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties. Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies, but the company is likely to remain an investment-grade credit. Moody's Investors Service now rates its debt Baa1, three notches above junk. 

One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades, concerned about Enron's viability, push for settlement of the trades, precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 

Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation, Enron has resisted, refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enron-created partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron. 

Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air, but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership, leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly $1 billion loss on that deal. 

Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the company's credit ratings. There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets, including its money-losing broadband business. 

Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its second-quarter book value of $13 a share, but it's worth noting that tangible book, excluding goodwill, was only $9 a share. Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enron's $1 billion asset writedown and its still-mysterious $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships. The third-quarter book value won't be known until Enron releases its balance sheet, which may not occur until its quarterly 10-Q is released. 

The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research. The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth. Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didn't demand it. The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the company's leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts' confidence in management. The Street really didn't provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a $75 billion valuation. That value has since shrunk to $14 billion. 

Enron's woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets. Until last week, Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enron's financial health. 

Enron had about $15 billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed off-balance-sheet debt. Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet, allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years. Judging from the company's rather meager credit lines, Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

10/27/2001
The Daily Telegraph 
P31
(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001 


LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 

Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.

Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 

Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to ""dispel uncertainty in the financial community"" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: ""We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."" 

The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 

Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 

Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called ""failed investments"".

ENRON STOCK SINKS TO 5-YEAR LOW 

Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its stocks hammered by a potential credit crunch and its chief financial officer's ouster, fell to its lowest close in more than five years on Friday. The fall was sparked by word of a big quarterly loss and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the ousted CFO's links to some of Enron's partnerships. Enron stock closed at $15.50, off 85 cents or 5.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 

Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 

Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships, details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected, but The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

In drawing down the $3.3 billion line of revolving credit this week, the company put about $1.1 billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper. 

Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 

Investors in commercial paper -- who are actually more like lenders, since it's actually a form of debt -- are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of short-term investments. 

The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit. 

""To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively,"" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 

""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin said. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."" 

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 

""Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues,"" Dietert wrote in a report Friday. ""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off."" 

Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 

For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 

Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. 

""Frankly, that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity,"" Feygin said. ""Until now, everything that's come out I've at least heard of or had some idea of what they were from the company's filings or discussions. This is something I had never heard of before.""

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company 

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 

An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.

The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 

The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 

Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 

Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 

The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

Enron Decline Continues

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 

The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 

""Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,"" said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. ""People are questioning the credibility of management."" 

The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 

The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 

Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 

Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ""a smart financial move,"" said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. ""It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital.""

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading giant, continued to pay the price for financial opacity as its stock slumped to its lowest level since 1995 and its five-year bonds traded at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. Page 10.

"Note from Nihon Keizai Shimbun","Ken

I just got a note that you sent me regarding a letter from Tadaaki Hashida at NHS requesting that you speak
at their conference (unfortunately it took almost two weeks to get from your desk to mine).  Mike McConnel has the Global Markets lead there (with Joe Hirl reporting to Mike and Joe serves as country manager).  The business that I have is a small metals team and the power development company of 16 employees working 
under the joint venture company ePower.  Nick O'Day runs this company for me.

Mike is the key guy to determine if your time would be well spent from his business perspective but relative to my businesses,
I doubt if it would be the best use of your time.  You may be aware that Mike's team is in the midst of negotiating a larger deal
with Nisho Iwai.  The success of this negotiation is likely to shed a great deal of light on our broader business prospects in Japan.

"FW: Silicon Valley Bank","Ken:

I called your office today and they informed me that the best way to get
this matter to you was to send you an email.  The negotiations between
Silicon Valley Bank and eVelocity have pretty much come to a decision point.
At bottom, Silicon Valley Bank will agree to renew the loan for six months
in exchange for a $250k paydown and monthly interest payments for the next 6
months.  The eVelocity folks tell me that this is slightly better (from a
total cash outlay) than they had proposed, but it does require additional
cash upfront.  In addition to the funds that you indicated that you would be
willing to provide, they have secured an additional $200k from other
investors.

The eVelocity management tells me that the proposed plan gives them the
liquidity they need.

I told them to proceed on that basis until I can get a response from you and
that I would recommend the bank's terms to you.

May I have your agreement?

If you have any questions, you can reach me at 713-515-5686 throughout
Friday and at 970-748-1643 throughout the weekend.

David:

Below is the latest from the Silicon Valley Bank, $250K up front and no
principal payments to January 31, 2002. The deal we proposed to the SVB
last week was $125K up front, $15K for September, October, November,
December, $100K December 31, 2001, and $55K January 31,2002. Total payments
by eVelocity to January 31, 2002 were $340K, $90K less than the $250K up
front.. Also they are not asking for warrants. We have for bridge
financing, pending approval of SVB position, the following: $500K from K.
Lay, $100K from Trillium, $50K from A. Bruce, and $50K from T. Nigrelli. I
am hoping to get another $100K from Ruben Jeffery (runs Goldman Europe).
Assuming we get only $700K for bridge, the Bank's proposed arrangement
leaves us $450K to January 31, 2002 which will keep us cash positive.

Getting the $1 mil loan down to $750K appears to satisfy the Santa Clara,
CA home office that this is a performing loan. We are anxious to move
forward as the Company is close to profitability which will posture it for
a long term fund raising.

Please let us know how Ken Lay feels about this.

Regards, Albert

I would like to note that Bryan, in error, has said that we would suspend
interest payments.  Interest would continue to be due monthly during the
period between now and 1/31/02.  Sorry for the confusion here.

"Robert Buzzanco","Hi, Ken:

I'm a former ECT VP who is just down the street, back at Ryder Scott Company
which was my home before my six-years with Enron.  A great six-ears, in
fact, I learned much and enjoyed the Company and the company, but it does
feel better to be back in the ""oil patch"".  I still have stock and will
continue to be a stockholder as I know the company will continue to be
innovative and dynamic.

My reason for this email is a recent op-ed piece in the Houston Chronicle by
Robert Buzzanco decrying the current campaign against terrorism.  His
editorial was at best silly, fraught with inaccuracies (as a geological
engineer I rely on facts - minorities make up 34.4% of the combined arm
forces - not the opposite as suggested in Buzzanco's piece) and intended
only to protract his personal agenda which has nothing to do with peace.
This may be more about selling his anti-American books than current events.
I could really care less about this person, he certainly has the right to
conduct his protest, many have fought and died for his right and more may
die in the coming days.  I do object to this guy using the University of
Houston to lend credibility to his cause.  That's like an Enron employee
(purely an example) marching in protests wearing the logo and identifying
him or herself with Enron.  He is a private citizen when he writes an
editorial or marches in protest.  He used his position at UofH  to get his
piece in the paper.  I know you are an alumnus, and I ask you to read his
editorial (10/8) and respond according to your hear.

Keep the ship on course, Ken.

Respectfully

Thomas M. Talley

"Wolf Blitzer Reports Wednesday","============================================================
Wolf Blitzer Reports at 5 p.m. & 7 p.m. ET
on Wednesday, January 9, 2002
============================================================
From Wolf Blitzer Reports
============================================================
Wolf Blitzer Reports Wednesday
============================================================
Today, on both editions of Wolf Blitzer Reports, we will
have the latest developments in the war in Afghanistan.
As you may have heard, a United States Marine Corps
aerial refueling plane crashed today in Pakistan. We
will have all the latest details from our reporters on
the scene and at the Pentagon.

   During our 5 PM (EST) program, I will get analysis
from retired U.S. Air Force Major General Don Shepperd
and the former Clinton national security adviser,
Samuel Berger. I will also speak with Congressman
Darrell Issa of California. It was in his district
where authorities discovered an employee at a nuclear
facility had lots of guns and ammunition in his home.
How vulnerable are America's nuclear facilities?
I will ask Issa.

   On our 7 PM (EST) War Room program, we will assess the
state of the military campaign with three guests:
Rep. Porter Goss, chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee; Paul Bremer, the former U.S. ambassador at
large for counter-terrorism; and Robert Oakley, the
former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.

And just click on http://www.CNN.com/Wolf to read my
column: ""Bush and Kennedy: The Ultimate Odd Couple.""

   Please join me today and every weekday at both 5 and
7 PM (EST).

   Thanks.

"Analyst & Associate Program - Summer Interns","
I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

"Safety Advisory:  Campus Mailrooms Closed for Cleaning (11/12/01)","CAMPUS MAILROOMS CLOSED FOR CLEANING
Officials Continue Precautionary Measures to Ensure Campus Safety

D.C. Department of Health Director Dr. Ivan Walks today confirmed that one
(1) of a total of 54 environmental samples from Howard
University's Main Mailroom on the ground floor of the Administration
Building tested positive for evidence of Anthrax spores.  Howard
University officials immediately closed the site and, after contacting CDC
(D.C.) Team Leader John Brooks, have already initiated the
clean-up process, which is expected to be completed within the next 12
hours.

The University has hired IT Corp., the same company contracted to clean the
Brentwood (U.S.) Postal Station in Washington, D.C., to
clean the mailroom.  In resolving the situation, the University also
contacted the FBI, CDC and the EPA and has affirmed that the
measures being exacted at Howard are in line with established, recommended
protocols.

In maintaining its proactive stance, the University hired a CDC-approved
contractor, Nichols Environmental Associates, which began
testing the mailrooms on Nov. 8.  As a precautionary measure, mailrooms in
Carver, Slowe, Meridian, Howard Plaza Towers, and the
schools of Divinity and Law will be closed until testing has been completed.
Each of these sites receives mail directly from the Brentwood
facility, including Howard University Hospital's mailroom which will be
tested on Tuesday, Nov. 13.  Results from the tests are expected
within the next 72 hours.

All employees of these mailrooms have been notified about the clean-up
process and each will report to the University's Employee Health
Center at Howard University Hospital on the morning of Nov. 13 for
additional, precautionary evaluation as well as instructions for reporting
to alternative work sites. As a precautionary  measure, the University had
already placed more than 300 mail-handling employees
on prophylactic medications in line with D.C. Department of Health and CDC
protocols, beginning the week of Oct 21.  Of the individuals
identified, none have shown signs of illness from the Anthrax bacteria.

Incoming mail will be stored at a secured campus site until completion of
work at the main campus mailroom.

As stated previously, employees with medical inquiries or health concerns
are encouraged to contact their personal or family physicians.
Students with medical inquiries or health concerns are encouraged to contact
their family physician or the Student Health Center.

"(Urgent:Dabhol Project and other India matters.)","Dear Ken,

I am writing to you today RE: The proposed sale of Enron's India assets
(non-core)-

FYI:
I am currently an Associate/Manager in the Research Group at Enron. I have
degrees in Mech. Engg & Finance, and will be graduating from Rice with my
MBA in March of 2002.
I have been following developments in the Dabhol matter since the summer of
2001, when I was asked to help put together a briefing/presentation for Ben
Glisan, former Treasurer, Enron Corp.

I recently read with great interest the proposed Enron re-organization plan.
I strongly believe given the opportunity, I can help achieve a successful
resolution of the company's various issues in India.  In my humble opinion,
our current India project negotiation team is unlikely to get the best price
for Enron's shareholders.

My background includes:

1) The Solicitor General of India is my brother's Father-in-Law.

2) Father currently holds the rank of Secretary, Govt. of India in New
Delhi. He is a close friend/advisor to both Mr. Vajpayee(P.M.)and Mr. Advani
(Home Minister)
Mother was on the faculty of Univ. of Michigan,& best friend of Mrs. Indira
Gandi, P.M. of India.- she is currently Professor Emeritus (Intl. Law) Univ.
of Delhi, UN expert & Member, Foreign Relations Committee.

3) My parents both earned Ph.Ds from the Univ. of Michigan,and have lived &
worked in the U.S. for several years-

4) I have substantial, successful experience in Asia.- India & I am
extremely familiar with the laws/regulations in India.

5) Born & raised in the U.S., I am a U.S. citizen. But I am fluent in Hindi
and other local Indian dialects.

6) My previous assignments have included a successful stint as Country
Manager in India(New Delhi) for Hyundai Corp. I successfully led a
multi-national/cross-functional project team in addition to my executive
responsibilities during this assignment.

7) Over 12 years of operating management experience with United Parcel
Service.  I have extensive experience in logistics and other transportation
issues.

Given the current financial situation of the company and your efforts to
marshall all the company's resources efficiently, I will stand-by to hear
back from you.

Hope you and your family have a very Happy Holiday Season!

U.S. CLIMATE POLICY: WHAT'S NEXT?

In a move that stunned the world, the Bush administration withdrew U.S. support for the Kyoto Protocol that addresses climate change. The protocol, which was never submitted for Senate approval, would have limited greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries. The question is what to put in its place.  As the Bush administration grapples with this complicated problem, we have assembled a team of experts to share their views on sensible climate policies for the U.S. in a post-Kyoto world.

"Moving Expenses!!!!","Mr. Lay,

I was relocated from Dallas to Houston around the 22 of October of this
year.  Now, less than a week from being laid off, I am receiving
correspondences from Roadrunner moving, stating that I am on the hook for
the $21,000 move!  Talk about adding insult to injury.

If this proceeds, and I am SOMEHOW found to be held responsible for Enron's
obligations to me, you will force me into personal bankruptcy - as I do not
have that kind of money lying around.

While I am hopeful that the agreement will be bound only between Enron and
this moving company, I would strongly encourage you to do the right thing
and honor this obligation!  We both know it is the right thing to do.

I would greatly appreciate a response and an understanding where you stand
on this particular matter.

Regards,

Paul Condit
Former Enron Net Works - EIM IT Manager

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

"Believing the Unbelievable by Samuel L. Blumenfeld","Believing the Unbelievable

by Samuel L. Blumenfeld

from the _Chalcedon Report_, Sept. 25, 2001

Emphasis Key: _italics_
-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

The reason why Americans were so psychologically
unprepared for the horrors of September 11th is because
they simply could not conceive of normal human beings
carrying out a plan of such diabolical destruction.
We've been led by progressive education, Unitarian and
liberal theology, and our left-leaning media to believe
that human beings are basically good and that when they
do terrible things like hijacking planes, they are
simply responding justifiably to American or Israeli
aggression. And even after the events of September
11th, there are American students and peaceniks who
have learned nothing from the experience.

Ordinary Americans could not understand that there were
human beings who would live among us, enjoy the
hospitality and pleasures of our free society, and yet
painstakingly plan to murder thousands of innocent
people in the name of religion. A good many Americans
are indifferent to religion. They enjoy Christmas and
Easter, but mainly as cultural events of the yearly
calendar, extravagantly boosted for commercial gain.
Religious fanaticism is something they cannot even
begin to deal with.

Nor could Americans understand how anyone, particularly
those who profess to believe in God, could be driven by
such consummate hatred that they would gladly inflict
on fellow human beings such extreme pain and cruelty.
Nothing in our American idea of religion, toleration,
sense of decency, and love for one's neighbor prepared
us for this kind of suicidal insanity. All of the
preaching in liberal churches, all of the humanism in
the public schools have left us psychologically
unprepared for a real encounter with evil.

And we are now being told that it could have been
worse, and that these Islamic fanatics are planning
bigger and better attacks against us. How does one
understand such evil? Back in the days after World War
II, our family in New York made contact with the
family's sole survivor of the holocaust in Europe. My
parents' extended families, living in Poland, had all
been killed. That sole survivor, my parents' niece, had
migrated to Canada with her husband whom she had met in
a displaced persons camp in Germany. My mother and I
took the train to Montreal where we had a very
emotional meeting with my cousin. In the course of our
conversations during our stay, I asked my cousin what
went through their minds when the Germans invaded
Poland. She said they all knew that things would be
bad, ""but we didn't know it would be that bad.""

They had assumed that the Germans were a civilized,
Christian people, from a highly cultivated society, and
were simply incapable of doing what they eventually
did. In fact, the Germans had been very friendly to the
Jews of Poland in World War I. What that, in time,
taught me is that the most civilized people in the
world were capable of the worst barbarism if the
circumstances made it possible. The pagan Hitlerian
regime is what made it all possible.

Of course, even if my relatives had known it would be
that bad, what could they have done? It wasn't until
most of the Jews of Warsaw had been taken to the death
camps that the remaining remnant decided to stage an
uprising. They felt it was better to die by fighting a
last-ditch battle and taking some of the enemy with
them, than merely dying as victims. In that regard, I
thought of those passengers in the hijacked plane over
Pennsylvania who decided it was better dying preventing
the hijackers from killing more Americans than to die
as passive victims smashing into the Capitol or White
House.

It wasn't until I became a Calvinist that I began to
understand how the Germans could do what they did. John
Calvin had no illusions about human nature, and he
found more than enough in the Bible to characterize man
as ""innately depraved."" And it is this innate depravity
that is the cause of evil in man. The only way that
innate depravity can be controlled is by belief in the
God of the Bible and His laws that tell us how to live.
Since America was founded for the most part by
Calvinists who believed in man's innate depravity, they
conceived of a form of government that would prevent
any one man from gaining so much power as to become a
dictator. They believed that it wasn't power that
corrupts man, but man who corrupts power.

That Calvinist distrust of man is at the basis of our
Constitutional system. But it is the liberals who have
tried to convince us otherwise. ""Trust us,"" they keep
saying. ""Give us your guns. Give us your children to
educate. Give us your earnings. Trust us.""

But there is enough of a residual distrust of
government among Americans that make them resist the
liberal siren song of seduction. And so, all it takes
to understand what happened on September 11th is to
understand human depravity in all of its horrendous
capabilities.

Back in colonial days, children were taught to read
with the New England Primer. Each letter of the
alphabet was taught in reference to a lesson from the
Bible. In teaching the letter A, the lesson was: ""In
Adam's fall, we sinned all."" Powerful stuff for the
children of early America. Today they are taught, ""See
Spot run,"" or its Mickey Mouse equivalent. We must do
better than that if we are to survive as the nation our
Founding Fathers gave us.

Dear Ken,
 
At a prayer meeting this morning I prayed for you, the Company, and all those affected by the circumstances you face.
 
I know that you are doing all that you can to help the Company and its people survive.  
 
The way we face great difficulty is the measure of our lives.  You have not run.  God will give you the strength to get thru this.
 
I know that Enron is not just a business for you, it is a dream .. a dream you have seen almost fulfilled.  I believe 'others' were sent to you to do harm .. and that they corrupted your dream.  It's a story as old as life itself.  
 
Ask God for His wisdom, His help, Hisbenediction. 
 
You are not alone Ken.  
 
God bless and keep you and your family safe.
 
John

"RE: Sheila and the Trade Promotion Authority","We have been working closely with the Trade Promotion outreach effort the White House established, and have regularly attended whip meetings with White House staff and others.  In that role, we are ""working"" a number of Texas Democrats.  I will talk again with the Congresswoman, and will call on Steve Kean to work her if needed.  No need for Ken's involvement with her at this point.

I asked Jim Kollaer if he had talked to our Washington office and he said they have been working on it, but this is going to take a call from Ken to Sheila.  Given the complexities of his schedule, if there is any other way, it would be good.  What do you think?

Subject:	Sheila and the Trade Promotion Authority


Ken, I am writing to ask Enron's assistance with a pro-Trade Promotion
Authority message to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee.

The position of the Partnership and Enron are well known to Sheila.  She
consistently has voiced doubts about her ability to vote for trade
issues such as China PNTR and fast track/TPA, but in the end joins her
pro-business and trade colleagues in supporting these measures. You have
always been a very effective lobbyist on this issue.

Most recently, on October 10, 2001, Rep. Lee told Rep. Norman Dicks
(D-WA) (he was the first D to be a supporter of this new compromise leg
(HR 3005) and is whipping the issue for the Ds) that she is a no vote on
TPA (HR 3005).

Rep. Lee's reasons for not supporting this issue are as follows:

1. The process has been too partisan, Ds like Rep. Charles Rangel were
not consulted and brought to the table to develop compromise language in
the beginning.

2. Since only 25 - 30 Ds will be voting for this (and we need her to be
one of those) she will feel alone as a D.

ACTION REQUESTED:  Ken, could you or someone senior at Enron place a
call to Rep. Jackson Lee to voice strong support for TPA?

An appropriate message is that we want her to focus on good public
policy.  We are not defending the process.  This is about good
economics.  TPA benefits her consituents.

We have attached a study that highlights the benefits of trade in her
district.  This may be useful information.  It has employment numbers
and more.

The TPA vote could come next week, as early as Tuesday.  A call to her
here in Houston at 713-655-0050 would be appropriate, as the House is
recessed until Tuesday.

Thanks in advance for your positive response to this request.

"ACT: conversion rate","Dear CEO Kenneth Lay:

The conversion rate of .15 is not acceptable to shareholders. It should be
at least .2 or above. We need to get bidders and more banks to back up Enron
while talking to Dynergy. .15 ratio was proposed by some analysts who short
the ENE stocks when the price was at above $9. The number .15 was published
in media again last week or so. ENE should not take this outrage number.
These hedge fund and short sellers will be happy if the ratio is .15. I
think .2 ratio is our bottom line.

May god gives you wisdom.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

"Interview request for Up Magazine","Dear Mr Lay,

Up Magazine, the leading magazine for British entrepreneurs,
(www.up-mag.com <http://www.up-mag.com>) would like to request an
interview with yourself for the September edition. Recent issues have
featured exclusive interviews with Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun
Microsystems, Kevin Ryan, CEO of DoubleClick, and Carly Fiorina, CEO of
Hewlett Packard.

As the magazine's 35,000 readership comprises ambitious business people
and budding entrepreneurs an in-depth feature on the lessons of
entrepreneurship from the oil industry would be of immense value.

Writer: The feature will be written by myself or my deputy, Adrian
Murdoch, formerly deputy editor of World Link, the magazine of the World
Economic Forum.

Photography. We would like to take our own original shots of yourself
and can travel wherever required.

Timeframe: We would require to speak to you before the end of July. If
your schedule does not permit a face-to-face interview then telephone
would be fine. We have also conducted several excellent e-mail
interviews in the recent past.

Thank you for your time. Should you have any questions do not hesitate
to give me call. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

"FW: A word of thanks","

Mr. Lay,

I realize that during these particularly tough times that you probably will not have the time to read this. In addition, I presume that you have received a high volume of notes from your employees regarding the issues of the day. I do hope, however, that you will take a moment to consider my thoughts and to step back from today's headlines and consider all of the tremendous opportunities that you have given all of your employees over the past 16 years. Your vision and hard work has accomplished more than just a business; it has provided many thousands of families support and structure. 

I moved to Houston last year to continue my EBS career. I am over 52 years old with a career in telecommunications sales and sales management. I continue to be excited about EBS opportunities; even though the rumors have us eliminated. The industry will improve. Our time should be spent cultivating future business relationships and becoming a fixture at the prospective counter parties' decision table. Anyway, my decision to move to Houston rather than to accept an ATT Natl Accounts Mngr continues to be the correct move in my opinion. I must admit that if EBS goes down; I will be in a very difficult position (at my age) to find another position; but the point is this...I do not want to work for any other company other than Enron. I made a commitment to EBS two years ago; and I have not swayed. I want to continue to work as a midmarketer for Enron and I thank you for your commitment to me and your other employees at Enron.

Dear  Ken,
 
Thank you for  returning my call.  Sorry I was out of the office.
 
I had called you  about two things:
 
Firstly, I would  like to ask your support of Enron Foundation's consideration of a grant to the  Bush Library endowment campaign and to give you an update on the campaign;  
 
and
 
Secondly, I would  like to talk to you about setting up a meeting with our CEO, Tom Casey.  I  have recommended Tom Casey for membership for the Business Council.   Several key CEOs have written letters of support, but Tom needs to get to know  some of the members of the Council's Executive Committee, and I believe you are  one of them.  Perhaps he and I can swing by Houston in the next few months to see  you?  
 
I am taking the  liberty of sending you a copy of our new Annual Report .
 
Hope to see you  soon,

"where to test suspecious letters in Houston?","
Dear Advisory Committee Members:
Please see the email below. The Secretary of Sri Meenakshi Temple (Hindu temple) received a suspecious letter. He was trying to get it tested. But he was not successful. If you know any specific agency in Houston who will test the letters, please email back phone number to call other than 911 or City Police Dept.. In Woodlands, the Hospital announced to call the police rather than taking the letter to Hospital emergency room (the lady's action closed ER).

Dear Kannappan 
I talked to you about that letter received; I tried to have it tested for Anthrax; 
I tried our SE Memorial Lab for a nasal swab from me: No; We don't accept specoimens; try city Health 
I spoke to City Health Epidemiologist: No We dont accept raw speicmens; Haz Mat is supposed to handle all that; Or try some private labs 
I spoke to Memorial sytems chief Pathologist; He reassured me that it is very unlikely and no need to do anything 
I called Houstin Fire department Head Quaters to test that letter; After several trials got a voice mail and left message few days ago; No reply 
It seems that Houston is nothing but ready; They are talking about Home kids to test suspicious letters, but in Houston there is no clear direction; Bayshore ER got directions to get nasal swab and start Cipro; Memorial Pathologist saays NO nasal swab 
If you know how I can test that letter let me know 
Thanks

We will elect a new President prior to my departure.  If you show him/her as much enthusiasm and support as you have shown me, the group will flourish to new heights.   Always remember, it is you that makes this group successful!!!  With over 600 of you employed by this company, you make a difference.  It shows in everything we do from one of the (if not the) most successful first year constituent golf tournament in HAO history/ to the inspiring of Texas A&M to form Aggies@Enron in our image/ to being the envy of other organized groups.  I am incredibly proud to be a Cougar, not just because of the university but the quality of our graduates.  Please keep the faith!  With your support we will achieve new heights!  Again, THANK YOU and let's keep in contact. Like I said we are Cougars whether we are employed here or else where.  My email address in jeffreymcclellan@zcougars.com.


Jeff

PS:  There will be a happy hour on the 8th. If you would like to come, please let me know and we will send details.

Subject: Take it to them
Last night, I opened up my Bible and found myself reading about  King
Hezekiah.  The bullet points are these:
1.  Hezekiah was  the most Godly man,
5 He trusted in Jehovah, the God of Israel; so that after  him was none like
him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were  before him.
  2 Kings 18:5 (ASV)
2.  The Assyrians surrounded  his city with a great army.
3.  He went to God with great faith and  honored God.
4.  God sent an angel
35 And it came to pass that night,  that the angel of Jehovah went forth, and
smote in the camp of the Assyrians  a hundred fourscore and five thousand:
and when men arose early in the  morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
  2 Kings 19:35  (ASV)
I don't know if he intervenes like this in corporate affairs, but  if we seek
His guidance, how can we lose.  Take care of  yourselves.
Love,
Mark

"Today's Article","Dear Ms. Smith and Mr. Calme,

I am sorry you could not reach me for comment on today's article.  I did not
receive any messages from you on my home phone, cell phone, office phone or
via email or fax, so I am not certain how you actually tried to reach me.
Nonetheless, since you seem to have run out of stories to report and have
decided to focus on transactions for 1997, I thought it would be helpful to
address some of the facts that you did not present in your story.

Three other partners, David Cox, Edward Ondarza and Sean Shaub, started
Paper & Print Management to develop a derivatives market for pulp and paper
products.  Mr. Cox and Mr. Ondarza were also brought into Enron when Enron
purchased the rights to the company and gave me the contract you described.
Mr. Cox received the same compensation terms as I did and Mr. Ondarza
received slightly lower compensation.  Both Mr. Cox and Mr. Ondarza are
still with Enron.  You may be familiar with Mr. Cox as he was featured in an
article that Fortune ran on Enron a couple of years ago.

The $1 million payment was used to purchase rights to the business from the
Southern Company, who had funded our startup costs.  With the acquisition,
and to this date, Enron is the leading market maker in pulp and paper
derivatives.  I believe they have transacted over $15 billion notional since
they acquired our company.  I do not have access to the specific P/L because
I am no longer with Enron, but the pulp and paper trading organization at
Enron generated enough profit to fully repay the cost of purchase, including
the contracts provided to myself, Mr. Cox and Mr. Ondarza, inside of two
years.

If I can answer any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.
Email is best.

Take care,
Mark

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

John -- I agree, and empathize, with all you say.  It is my fervent hope
that the lawyers give your group and other Enron entities the go ahead to
speak publicly before more hearings and other public forums are scheduled.
Otherwise, it makes it so hard on you and other innocents to be painted with
a broad brush and thus continue to get villified with ""the bad apples"" by
the media.  However, you have an impeccable reputation of honesty,
integrity, intelligence, sound judgement, so it's merely a matter of time
before you and the innocents can set the record straight.  But keep telling
them the time for message management is NOW!  Last week, NBC assigned one of
their veteran political reporters to the Enron story, and she displayed a
woeful paucity of understanding about the world of finance.  The resulting
story was detrimental to the innocents and wouldn't have happened, were the
various E groups permitted to manage their stories.  I hope your meetings
today and tomorrow are productive for your team!  Keep the faith!  (And yes,
I'm reading everything I can get my hands on.)

Thanks for the input of the article.  I had read it along with many others.

These read awful but how else could they read when one considers the final
result.  It is all so sad.  Believe me, we, Enron, had some bad apples in
the
financial department and they were there long enough to do the damage for
all
but themselves.  So, now we simply wait for ""time to tell"" the full story.
I
met all day yesterday with ""the lawyers"" working with the independent

hundreds of articles like the one you E-mailed to me.

Keep thinking and reading for me as you may soon become my PR agent.  And,

Enron Is History, Says History
By HOLMAN W. JENKINS JR.

November 28, 2001
Business World

Back in the mid-1980s, a pipeline executive called Ken Lay was fishing
around for a name for his company, produced by a merger of Houston Natural
Gas and Omaha-based InterNorth. He consulted with consultants, politicked
with politicians, and came up with a moniker. The company would be called
""Enteron.""

Three weeks later, fed up with the wisecracks from a press that had looked
up the dictionary definition of ""enteron"" (n. the intestine), he changed the
company's name again. Henceforth it would be known as Enron.

A columnist less devoted to high standards of decorum might be tempted to
extend the metaphor of the company's misbegotten name. In recent weeks,
after all, we've seen Enron's stock collapse over indigestible accounting
and the emergence of dealings between the company and its senior officers
that exude an odor of genuine malfeasance. The evidence is far from clear,
but for the sake of Mr. Lay's reputation one hopes these missteps will prove
one more case of a company fooling itself rather than setting out
deliberately to defraud the markets.

Enron grew to be much more than a pipeline hauler of natural gas, becoming
the pre-eminent trader and marketer of all kinds of energy contracts and a
vocal proponent of deregulation. Now, all but overnight, it's kaput, just
waiting to find out if its fate will be bankruptcy or absorption by an
erstwhile rival.

We cannot help be put in mind of another commodity wunderkind in the 1970s,
Phibro (short for Philipp Brothers). Hard to believe, but Phibro was once a
name that made grown men quiver on Wall Street. Fattened by trading profits
from the great commodity inflation of the 1970s, which some mistook for a
permanent new age of scarcity, it scooped up the Street's oldest
partnership, Salomon Brothers, tucking it into its back pocket and renaming
the combined firm Phibro-Salomon. Here was a powerhouse of unlimited
potential, investors told themselves.

Flash ahead to California's electricity meltdown earlier this year. Enron
saw its revenues quadruple partly as a result of the inflated prices being
quoted in the California market. Many foresaw a new scarcity megatrend, but
there was no true energy shortage. Posted prices on the California power
exchange may have skyrocketed, but the effective price was zero dollars and
zero cents, because the utilities had no cash to pay and politicians were
thumbing their noses at piles of IOUs.

When prices are zero, suppliers take a hike -- that's what economics
teaches. But once the state government started pumping its own cash into the
market, the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentiful
again. Now California is swimming in power and nobody talks about an ""energy
crisis"" anymore.

You can date the loss of investor confidence in Enron almost exactly to the
moment when the California fiasco began to repair itself. Fortune Magazine
put the inaugural nail in Enron's coffin in March, noting that the company's
growing dependence on trading had turned it into an oil-patch version of
Goldman Sachs. Goldman's stock sells at a price-earnings multiple of 17,
reflecting investors' well-founded distrust of trading earnings to be
reproduced reliably year after year. So why, the magazine asked, was Enron
awarded a multiple of 60-plus? Mmm...

Enron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation. Boss Ken Lay, a
believer in technology and the power of markets, was a true visionary, to
the point of annoying people who didn't care for his air of being a man on
the right side of history. The moldering pipeline he took over would
certainly have been an also-ran if he had not thrown Enron headlong into
trading and marketing.

But deregulation doesn't confer permanent advantage on anybody. A
deregulated environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsetting
of plans and strategies.

Add the fact that, despite the California bubble, there is no reason to
believe energy prices won't continue their long-term relative decline as
technology advances more quickly than the depletion of conventional
resources. Add also the likelihood that information technology will continue
to lower the barriers to entry to Enron's trading business, which means more
competition and shrinking margins. Enron begins to look a lot like Phibro.

The great commodity-trading machine was already running down by 1981, when
it bought Salomon and Wall Street was swooning. Inflation was being quelled
by Paul Volcker. The products that Phibro traders bought and sold were
increasingly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges. ""Four or
five years ago, they used to be able to take other companies to the
cleaners, because they knew where the market was and others didn't,"" a
trader explained. ""With everyone knowing, within a few cents, where the
price of any product was, Phibro's ability to make a profit off its superior
knowledge disappeared.""

Not only is this true of Enron, but of its would-be bottom fisher, Dynegy,
run by Mr. Lay's Houston homeboy, Chuck Watson. Dynegy's proposed takeover
of its former nemesis was hanging by a negotiation yesterday.

While Enron in recent years was selling hard assets and concentrating on
electronic market-making, Mr. Watson was doing the opposite. His big play in
the Enron deal is to get his hands on the original HNG-InterNorth pipeline,
now known as Northern Natural Gas. By having both feet planted in the real
business, he claims his firm will be able to make a profitable sideline out
of trading despite growing competition and transparency.

We'll see. Dynegy and Enron were born at the same time, and of the same
motive. Dynegy was originally created by six pipeline companies, a
Washington law firm and Morgan Stanley to take advantage of new
opportunities in deregulated natural gas. But the gnats are already
circling.

Gas producers who have claimed for years that the duo control too much of
their fate now insist they shouldn't be allowed to merge. Don't listen to
the fussbudgets. If this was a business in need of trustbusting, Enron
wouldn't have been resorting to funny accounting to make its earnings. As
Merrill Lynch's Donato Eassey has pointed out, wholesale margins have been
steadily thinning as trading becomes more transparent and competitive.

Wishful accounting has time and again proved the last refuge of companies
whose dearly held ""visions"" were not panning out. Enron prided itself on
being realistic and adaptive, but it failed to see that its own beliefs
about the world needed overhauling.

Osmar Abib
Managing Director
Kenneth Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Enron
Dear Kenneth:
On behalf of Credit Suisse First Boston, I would like to invite you to join
us for the PGA Tour Championship which will be held at Champions Golf Club
in Houston from Thursday, November 1st  through Sunday November 4th.
The Tour Championship is an annual event which showcases the top 30 money
winners and features one of the largest purses of the year on the PGA Tour.
Champions Golf Club, which has also hosted the Ryder Cup, the PGA
Championship, the United States Open and the United States Amateur, will
once again host the Tour Championship, following up on the extremely
successful 1999 and 1997 Tour Championships.  The field this year should be
very exciting, as it is likely to include Tiger Wood, David Duval, Phil
Mickelson, Sergio Garcia and Davis Love III.
We would like you and a guest to join us for the  3rd and 4th rounds of the
Tour Championship on Saturday and Sunday.  We will be hosting a private
hospitality chalet adjacent to the 9th green, from which you will be able to
watch the tournament or take a break from following your favorite players on
the course.  We sponsored the same chalet for the 1997 and 1999 Tour
Championships, and it provided a wonderful setting to view the players
up-close on the 9th hole, as well as provide a cool environment to enjoy
some food and drinks.
In order to assist us in our planning, we ask that you take a moment to
respond via e-mail indicating your interest by Friday, October 26th.  We
will provide additional details upon your acceptance.
We hope you will join us for this exciting event and we look forward to
seeing you there.
Sincerely,


Karen A. White on behalf of Osmar Abib

"RE: FW: HoustonChronicle.com (2)","With all due respect ""Judge"" that is not the issue in this case.  Calling
911 because some chick tries to use a fake ID???  Does Chuy's call 911 every
time a minor tries to buy a drink?  Of course not.

By the way, I live in Austin and have eaten at Chuy's many times and can
testify first hand to the fact that I have seen many people drinking their
who were obviously not yet 21.  The manager of Chuy's took a stand on the
issue?  Jesus, give me a break!!

Maybe I don't know enough about the role of Chuy's in this incident, but
exactly why are we mad about a bar stopping underage girls from drinking?  I

would think everyone would be applauding the fact that somebody would take a

stand on this important issue.

"Thank You","Hi Ken,

	I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you're trying to do for us during this horrible situation.  It would have been easy to stay at home (many people would have) and watch events unfold but you had the guts and the heart to come back and take this thing head on. Being a 21+ year Enron/NNG employee, this situation has been heartbreaking... I know you're there too.  Many employees are sitting around in a daze over everything we've lost; I've lost everything too, BUT there are SO many things I have in my life that I would never have achieved had it not been for you and your leadership.  I am eternally grateful for everything you've done for Enron and for me personally. Hang in there, we still believe in you and this company.

God Bless You,

Craig Buehler

"2001 1205","Dear Ken,

I am writing as a former London employee whose last day in the office was
Friday 30th November.
I don't know if you are aware but this time of year is the tightest time of
year for recruitment in London both in the temporary and permanent market
place.
I am confident in the skill-sets that I can bring to the current market
place but the average job search takes 2-3 months and unfortunately I do not
have the financial security to enable me to live through that time. That is
why I am asking for a small donation of ?1000 to help me pay my mortgage and
to see me through Christmas.

This e-mail is cheeky but I felt that I had nothing to lose and I hope that
you will respond positively to it.
Regards
Jane

"Bank meetings in New York","Ken,

I am responsible for managing Enron's banking relationships, and have been speaking to Rosalee about reserving time on your calendar for meetings with our top 4 banks.  Given the uncertainty and tightness in the credit markets,  Andy, Ben and I have discussed the importance of getting you and Andy in front the senior members of management at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, CSFB, and Deutsche Bank.  We are expecting all of these institutions to play an important role in achieving our year-end financing plan. 

Rosalee has indicated that you may have time available on Tuesday, November 6th to meet in New York.

Please let me know if you can make your calendar available for these meetings.

Thank you,

Kelly

"Media Reports","
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

"WEF Council Meeting -- Follow -Up","Ladies and Gentleman:

As a follow up to our last Council meeting, we agreed to elaborate and
clarify our thoughts on the Global Business Council.  Some of those who
attended the meeting have already shared thoughts and ideas with us.  Now I
would like to get input from others on the Council.  We intend to complete
this process as quickly as possible, as Klaus has requested that we present
a reframed charter at the next council meeting in early November.   We had
intended to launch this project sooner, but events of last two weeks
prevented this.

I have asked Sunny Misser, US leader of PwC's Sustainability services to
assist me in this effort.  Sunny will be contacting you in the next few
days to understand your thinking and incorporate your perspective in this
charter.

Additionally, I am including an overview of the process and timetable for
your review.  As we proceed with this exercise, it would be helpful to
understand your thoughts in the following areas:

- What are some of the key pressures confronting the WEF
- What is the value of creating a Global Business Council
- What will the GBC do (i.e. role/function)
- How should the GBC be positioned within the WEF
- How will we practically implement the GBC

Thank you once again for taking the time from your busy schedules to
develop this thinking. We will keep you apprised of our progress.

Sincerely,

Jim

Mr. Lay:

Thank you again for lunch yesterday.  I really did enjoy spending time with you are your family.  

As I mentioned yesterday, I have some internal public relations suggestions for your review.   Please feel free to contact me if you wish to discuss this further.  I would welcome the opportunity to expand on these suggestions and help in any way you deem necessary.  

I am off to GA to make you some money and will be back on Wednesday.  You are in my thoughts and prayers.

Yours sincerely,

"Italian Prime Minister's Remarks","Dear Ken,

I hardly ever had to write about the issue of the current affairs that I
feel myself obliged to circulate the attached International Herald Tribune
Article (http://www.iht.com/articles/33780.html) to my close friends.  I
found, however, that the statement made on Wednesday by Premier Berlusconi
in Berlin, to be so damaging to the ideals to which I am sure we all aspire,
that I felt it imperative to share my reaction with you.

To my mind it is self-evident that we all naturally work towards achieving
harmony and co-existence with all believers in the one God to whom we pray.
Mr. Berlusconi's remarks can only serve to divide fellow believers and
nations.  Such statements, in all their divisive and corrosive impact, must
not be allowed to remain unchallenged by society at large.

If you feel as I do, regarding the instinct of a supposed world leader, I
would implore you to write to him to express your condemnation.  It would
obviously be helpful if you would ask your friends to do the same.

At this difficult juncture in world affairs, we should accentuate our common
goals rather than the reverse as Prime Minister Berlusconi's remarks have
done.  Those of influence, must, I believe, make sure that their strongly
held opinions against such ill-judged words are perfectly clear.

Warm regards,
Khalid A. Alireza
Executive Director

"Earnings Media Schedule","Ken -- As you can see from the attached schedule, the level of media interest in Enron's earnings has grown considerably in the past 18 months.  As a result, we have developed a fairly rigorous schedule to provide interviews with the main broadcast, wire and print media.   

This quarter, we will do the broadcast interviews with CNBC, CNNfn and Bloomberg TV from an office on the 32nd floor trading floor, rather than in the Board room.  We think that this is an optimal location because we want the backdrop to show that you're back in the midst of the action.

Given the recent events, you are likely to get questions about security, energy infrastructure and impact of Sept. 11 on Enron.  We have compiled a Q&A/messaging document, which covers these issues and other earnings-related topics.  I will send the Q&A later today.

Mark Palmer or I will meet you following the analyst call, and we will go to EB3241 for the broadcast interviews, then come back to your office to place the calls to the wire and print reporters.

Also, Vijay Vaitheeswaran of the Economist is in town this week, and he would like to interview you about where Enron is headed under your direction.  He is scheduled to meet with you for 45 minutes at 1 p.m.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you.
Karen

"U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray - Survey Results","Thought you might be interested in this survey.














Did you know that more Monopoly money is printed in a year than real money
printed throughout the world? Did you also know that we would greatly
appreciate your participation in our survey (see below)?






This report is available in PDF format (55.4k) at

 II. Survey Says







Thanks again to everyone that took the time to respond to our survey. We
will conduct similar surveys in the future in order to keep our fingers
ever closer to the pulse of e-business activity. We greatly appreciate your
input.


This survey's results were interesting, and provided us with quite a bit of
insight. At the same time, the responses to many questions were
conflicting, reflecting the current state of uncertainty within the sector
and the overall economy. The survey's participants came from a wide variety
of professions, though more than 50% came from consulting firms and
software companies. Please find an overview of the responses we received
for each of the questions, grouped by category, along with commentary
below.


Recovery?
Have we reached a ""bottom"" in terms of the decline of corporate spending on
e-business initiatives? Unsurprisingly, there was wide disagreement on this
topic, with 45% of respondents replying ""probably,"" yet 43% countering with
""probably not.""


45% Probably
43% Probably not
4% Definitely not
8% Not even close


When will we see a meaningful uptick in corporate spending on e-business
initiatives? There was also disagreement on this topic, though 90% expect
an uptick at some point during 2002. True bulls (the 8% who answered
""Q401"") and true bears (the 2% that selected ""2003 or later"") were few in
number.


8% Q4 2001
47% Early 2002
43% Late 2002
2% 2003 or later


In our view, we may have reached a bottom during the September quarter, as
this quarter is seasonally weak in any year, and this year witnessed one of
the most challenging and paralyzing times that the United States has
encountered in years. However, we do not necessarily expect to see a
significant uptick during the next few quarters, as we expect the economy
and corporate earnings (which ultimately drive capital expenditure and IT
budgets) to weaken further during that time. The key question is when
corporate executives will sense a stabilization in their businesses, and
thus begin to feel more confident about investing.


IT Spending Priorities And Architecture
Please rank the following application categories, in terms of strategic
importance to the organization and likelihood of receiving IT budget
approval over the next 12 months. Of the categories available for
selection, supply-chain management ranked No. 1, closely followed by
customer relations management (CRM), e-procurement, and application
integration. Human capital management, product life cycle management, and
application server software were at the bottom of the list.


1 Supply-chain management
2 CRM
3 e-Procurement
4 Application integration
5 BI/Analytics
6 ERP
7 Application server software
8 Product life cycle management
9 Human capital management


How important a consideration is 100% Internet architecture when evaluating
e-business software products? The soft economy does not appear to have
tempered enthusiasm for new technology, as 45% answered ""critical,"" with
another 45% responding ""somewhat important."" This was summed up by one
participant, who wrote, ""the traditional software model is dead; the
importance of pure, Web-native architecture is critical to unleashing the
full potential of interenterprise e-business initiatives."" Only 10%
responded ""not very important"" or ""does not matter."" In light of these
responses, it should come as no surprise that the vast majority of vendors
are now moving at breakneck speed to bring truly Web-based products to
market.


45% Critical
45% Somewhat important
9% Not very important
1% Does not matter


Marketplaces And Portals
Despite the spectacular rise and fall of public marketplaces, many
participants remain bullish on marketplace technology. Additionally, most
respondents envision portals emerging as a central part of the IT
ecosystem, though response here was less positive than for marketplaces.


Will the use of e-marketplaces (private, public, or other) eventually be an
important piece of a corporation's e-business initiatives?
More than 90% answered positively, with 50% saying ""without a doubt;"" 41%
responding ""probably;"" and only 1% saying ""definitely not."" As our readers
have seen us comment many times, we believe that the bulk of future
marketplace activity will be centered around private marketplaces.


50% Without a doubt
41% Probably
8% Probably not
1% Definitely not


Will corporate portals eventually constitute the main ""window"" through
which users are able to access multiple, heterogeneous software
applications, along with relevant content, analytic analysis? Slightly less
than 90% responded in the affirmative, with 34% saying ""without a doubt;""
and 53% responding ""probably."" While we agree that portal technology is
important, we believe that the jury is still out on whether or not this
will prove to be a profitable, stand-alone product offering.


34% Without a doubt
53% Probably
12% Probably not
1% Definitely not


Suite Versus Best-Of-Breed
Respondents were by and large not in the suite camp, though they drew a
clear distinction between emerging and mature technologies.


Which approach will win over the long run, a best-of-breed approach or
buying an entire suite from a single vendor? Only 13% voted in favor of the
suite approach, though only 30% voted for best-of-breed. The majority (57%)
opted for the more neutral answer that ""best-of-breed will win when dealing
with emerging technologies and the suite approach will win when dealing
with more mature technologies."" The comments of one participant stressed
the difference between mission-critical and less-important functionality,
and offered hope for smaller vendors, particularly those with vertical
focus. He wrote, ""corporations will opt for best-of-breed software where it
addresses part of their mission critical activities, but will opt for a
suite activities that are not central to their core business. As a result,
many niche vendors will emerge as very important, particularly those that
correctly and deeply solve specific problems in a given vertical.""


30% Best of breed
13% Suite
57% Best-of-breed will win when dealing with emerging technologies and the
suite approach will win when dealing with more mature technologies


Obstacles To Adoption
Regarding obstacles to adoption there was little consensus among
respondents, though it was clear that many obstacles remain, and remain
challenging.


With respect to obstacles that inhibit broader adoption of e-business
software solutions, please rank the obstacles below. All obstacles listed
came in neck-and-neck for the lead, with ""user adoption: challenges of
changing business process and behavior"" topping the list. One person
commented, ""success of implementation resides in a company's ability to
manage change and understand that this is not a system added or a plug-in,
but a new approach to the existing way their businesses is conducted.""


Regarding ""integration challenges with existing, internal applications,""
one participant wrote, ""integration of applications in a timely and
cost-effective manner continues to be the single most important challenge
facing e-business adoption."" The challenges involved with data mapping was
also cited as another key obstacle by one respondent.


1 User adoption: challenges of changing business process and behavior
2 Integration challenges with existing, internal applications
3 High cost and lengthy time of implementation
4 Questionable or insufficient ROI
5 Integration challenges with external business partners


Market leadership
Who will be the most important e-business software vendor in five years? On
this front participants ranked Microsoft No. 1, followed closely by Oracle,
SAP, and IBM. Sun also appeared as a write-in candidate. However, stressing
the ever-entrepreneurial nature of the e-business software sector, one
respondent commented, ""it is very possible that the most important
e-business software vendor will be a start up who is not on anybody's radar
screen yet.""


1 Microsoft
2 Oracle (#)
3 SAP
4 IBM
5 Siebel (#)
6 PeopleSoft (#)
7 i2 (#)
8 BEA Systems (#)


As always, we welcome your thoughts and feedback. Regarding this survey
specifically, we would be particularly interested to hear your opinions on
the results, along with your thoughts on additional topics that are worth
exploring in future surveys.

"GBC - Strawman Charter","Ladies and Gentlemen:


Thank you for the constructive dialogue and feedback you have provided to
the process of developing a charter for a Global Business Council at the
WEF.

As part of the process, we have solicited Council member feedback on the
proposed role, structure, governance, activities and performance of the
Global Business Council.  A large number of members have responded through
interviews, e-mail and faxes with their thoughts and perspectives.

You have clearly communicated to us that in order to be a successful and
high performing group, the Global Business Council needs to:

-    Have a clear and articulate purpose
-    Primarily serve as an advisory body
-    Work in a flexible and informal manner
-    Develop a balanced agenda of globally relevant business issues
-    Provide a forum to review these core issues in depth
-    Have meetings that provide substantive discussion to progress the core
agenda.

We have incorporated this thinking into a strawman charter for your review
and feedback.  We will include your comments on this strawman and develop
the next iteration of the draft charter by November 2nd.

As discussed, all responses and comments will be recorded without
attribution to the member source.

Thank you, again, for taking the time to support this exercise.

Sincerely,

Sunny

"WEF Draft","Ladies and Gentlemen:

As a follow up to Jim Schiro's note, I would like to solicit your views and
understand your thinking as it relates to the Global Business Council.

It would be helpful to get your thoughts and ideas to develop the framework
of the Global Business Council in the following areas.  I am aware of the
pressures on your time.  Brief points, or the first thoughts that come to
mind will suffice.

ROLE

   What are the primary objectives/activities of the GBC?
   What are the specific activities that the GBC will undertake and those
   it will not undertake?

STRUCTURE

   Who should be members of the GBC
   How many members should be on the GBC?
   What are your recommendations for the 1) membership selection process,
   2)  membership period, 3) membership orientation

GOVERNANCE

   What should the leadership structure look like?
   How should leaders be selected, and the length of terms?
   How often should the GBC meet (keeping in mind the objectives of the
   group)?
   What are your recommended location (s) and/or format of meetings (e.g.,
   face-to-face in various locations, video conferences, etc.)

PROCESS

   How should the GBC operate in order to accomplish its goals (working
   groups, special projects, interaction)?
   Who should attend the meetings (WEF members, only GBC)?
   How should the GBC interact with the other councils (WEF consultative
   groups, etc.)?

PERFORMANCE

   How will the performance of the GBC be monitored (groups and
   individuals)?

     -    Performing the key responsibilities of the charter
     -    Council dynamics:  communication, discussion and consensus
     -    Interaction with the WEF and other councils
     -    Appropriateness of focus areas
     -    Attendance, preparation and participation

We will incorporate your feedback into a strawman charter and circulate it
for your review next week.

Thank you once again for taking the time to shape this thinking.


Sincerely,


Sunny

(P.S. - Many thanks to those who have already responded to Jim's initial
note).

"Enron","
Mr. Lay, as an employee and a stock holder of  Enron, I'm very concerned with what's going on within our company.  I have  always been very positive about Enron and very supportive of the management,  however I truly believe that when Mr. Skillings was made CEO of the company the  investment community lost interest in our company.
 
I know you can't tell me where the stock will be in  12 to 18 months but it would be some re-assurance to hear from you.

Sent:	Monday, November 05, 2001 10:09 AM
To:	VP's and Above- Enron Management Conference List@ENRON
Subject:	2001 Management Conference


During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

"I am praying for you.","
Mr. Lay, 
I just want you to know that I am praying for you constantly. Keep your eyes on Jesus and don't listen to what everyone is saying! He will say whatever He wants to say to you as you read the Word. He does not ""point the finger"" and accuse. In fact He doesn't even like that. (Isaiah 58:9  ""Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;"") That word vanity in the Hebrew means trouble, wickedness, sorrow. I guess that verse means you can't do it either even when they hurt you with their words. God will defend you. 
You said something about being old fashioned that the truth will prevail. That is not old fashioned .... that is God. You have that in your heart because you have Jesus in your heart. Believe God! He says ""if God is for us then who can be against us?"" 
What a WONDERFUL Word of Testimony you will have when this is finished. Remember, He brings us out of ALL our afflictions! (Psalm 34:19  ""Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all."")
I listened to a teaching one time about Rev 12:11 ""And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.""  They said that the devil can't take the blood away from us and that he wants to destroy our testimony. Mr. Lay, you turned to Jesus in time of trouble. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You continually pray for guidance. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust in Him. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You trust that He will bring you through this. That is part of this Word of Testimony. You will tell the truth. That is part of this Word of Testimony. 
When all is said and done. God is going to show you and others (2 Chron 16:9  ""For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him."")
I am telling you. That is what God showed me in the 16 Days readings. God testified of a perfect heart towards him. Yours. Not that you have done ""perfectly""  but that you had a ""perfect heart towards him"". It is clearly shown in how you conduct yourself. 
I ran across these verses and thought you might like them to encourage you. 
2 Sam 22:33  God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 
1 Chron 29:12  Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
Psalm 62:11  God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. 
Isaiah 40:29  He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. 
If your secretary could send me the dates you are to testify before Congress, it is on my heart to pray specifically for you while you testify.
Thank you, Jesus, for your Word. Thank you for your servant, Mr. Lay. Thank you that you ARE going to get him THROUGH all of this. In Jesus name.

It looks like both of you have pocketed
millions of $ selling your positions
whereas small investors like me are

Where are the sales wins, where are
the press releases ? What are you
waiting for ? For people like me to

"Security Idea","Dear Ken,

	With everything that has happened in the past few weeks, I think we all realize how dangerous this world truly can be.  As an employee, I appreciate the security measures that Enron has implemented over the years; however, I think the events of September 11th show that maybe we haven't gone far enough.  Although we could do little about a suicide attack from the air, there are many other types of attack we could prevent or minimize.  The Houston Police Officers, around the buildings and on regular patrol, provide good basic protection.  However, in the event of a city-wide attack, the Police  would be unavailable and we would have to take some type of action ourselves.  The Security firm contracted for the building lacks the training to respond to life and death situations.  I would recommend, and volunteer for, a security team comprised of Enron employees with prior military or police service.  There may come a time, God forbid, when we just have a few moments to act and the police may not be available.  If we can't defend ourselves in the first few minutes of an act, it could be too late.  I served in an anti-terrorist unit in the U.S. Army and have a few ideas that I think could help.  If this is in the realm of possibility, I would be happy to discuss this with whomever you designate.  I do feel safe here at work but planning for the worst, before it happens, seems very prudent in these times.  Thanks!

I received a copy of the agenda for your October 3 & 4 conference on
Alternative Futures for the Current Energy Crisis.  I applaude you for your
continued leadership in the public policy arena for energy.

The absence of representatives from the coal industry is obvious.  Since
coal is America's largest domestic energy resource and it fuels 52% of
America's electricity, it should be represented.

Thank you for your consideration and best wishes.

"re: Jeff McMahon named CFO","Mr. Lay-

It was galling of you to blame employee rumors for Enron's falling share
price, as you did in your last eSpeak.

Most of us ""employees"" have never met an analyst. Most of us have not
left Enron, and continue to work hard here, unlike the large number of
Senior Management who have bailed ship. Most of us continue to buy Enron
stock, unlike Senior Management who remain brutal sellers of the stock.
And, most of us are compelled to be profitable on an almost daily basis
in our tasks, unlike Senior Management and its pet projects.

We are entitled to contrition from you, not spin. You made $140 million
last year as CEO of Enron, and none of us complained. We simply followed
you and your self-annointed protege' Jeff.

We didn't cause these recent events, Mr. Lay, in any way. You and Jeff
are almost solely responsible for the drop in Enron's share price. So
far, it's tragic for Enron that you choose to spin. Contrition would
have been accepted by most of us without question. And it probably still
would be.

Why don't you send out another email and accept personal responsibility
for the share price decline? As Joe Sutton would say, ""step up and be a
leader.""

PS Before you dismiss me as a troublemaker, you might know my PEP's are
for unquestioned loyalty to Enron. When I make a promise to my superiors
I deliver, even if that means working nights, weekends, or from home.

"Rob Quartel and ENW All Employee Meeting Video","I received the FreightDesk Technologies packet from you that was sent to you by Rob Quartel.
 
Since they are asking for Enron to be a strategic investor, I will run it by Kevin Garland's Investment group.  I will also run it by Dan Reck's Freight group, which sits within EGM.  We will get back with Rob.
 
Also, we had an Enron Net Works all employee meeting recently at the Hyatt (October 5th).  Over 1000 employees attended.  The goal was to communicate to my employees what is Enron Net Works and our vision going forward.  I believe it went very well.  Mary Clark, Internal Communications attended as well.  If you would like, we have a 13 minute video that you may want to see.  It is 3 minutes of funny stuff that we ran up front while people were coming in and 10 minutes of what ENW is with the message being we are a service company.  Let me know if you would like a copy or if you want to arrange 15 minutes of your time for me to show it to you.
 
Thanks.

"Empathy","
Hi Ken:
 
I know these are tough times for you and your  team.  As a friend (and former stockholder who did well), I just want to  add a note of empathy and wish you well.
 
You did a brilliant job in building the  company.  While I'm not sure about where it went wrong, I'm confident that  you tried to do the right things at all times.
 
I hope it will resolve itself soon, but my guess is  that it will be a long haul (especially with the partisan overtones).   Those guys never built anything, and you did.  Something to keep in mind as  the media piles on.
 
All the best wishes,
Ken

"RE: Media Reports","Sir,
I read your note with great deal of interest and care.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this email was devoid of any stereotypical remarks that are so prevalent in the mass media today.

Unfortunately, such is not the case with other communications being sent out on behalf of Enron Corp.  A case in point is the corporate security email, titled 'Travel Security Update', that was send out yesterday.  In this email, reaction to possible U.S. military retaliation has been tied to extremist Islamic violence.  Truth of the matter is that any reaction to the U.S. military action could be because of extreme nationalism, most likely to the be the case, or even extreme regionalism.  References to Islam, extremism, and violence, in the manner used in the security communication only perpetuates the stereotypes.

I would like for you and my co-workers at Enron to know that MUSLIMS DO NOT HATE AMERICANS (regardless of what Frank Graham wants to believe).  Muslims do have deep-rooted disagreements and distrusts of the American foreign policy but that in no way translates to what the mass media  would have us believe.

thanks

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

"GO ENRON !!","

    Dear Mr. Lay ,

                   I was employed as an EGLI employee twelve years ago and currently I am a contractor with EES power company . My wife has been

                   with ENRON for fifteen years eversince she came out of U of H . Our hearts bleed ENRON blood and they were wounded deeply last

                   Friday night when we saw you on TV announcing the sale of ENRON to Dynergy . We are and still very grateful to all the good things 

                   that ENRON has provided to our family ( we have three children) and feel so blessed to be associated with such a caring and generous

                   company . 

                    Mr Lay , we love you , respect you and most of all we trust you to do everything in your power to help to save ENRON and in process

                    all of its employees . Our hearts were broken when we saw your face in that Friday announcement . The stress of giving up ""your child""

                    away can be devastated and I think you have aged greatly the last three weeks or so . The stress impact was almost the same as that

                     which I saw on Mr . Michael Cappellas as he announced the sale of Compaq to HP sometimes ago . Please beleive us we felt this way

                     whether you gave back the 60 millions or not . ( I felt you deserve the money because under your leadership ENRON has growthed

                      tremendously the last fifteen years or so and hence all the people here including the critics have the jobs that they currently have and 

                      99.99 % of them would have taken the money anyway besides that what are the reasonable compensation to a leader that have tripled

                      or quadrupled shareholders values ?. Look at Michael Eisner , Larry Orvitz and dozen other Fortune 500 CEO 's compensation including 

                      those that have not added any values to their respective companies during their tenure and they will see your compensation are justified .  
    

                     Throughout the years we saw so many changes at ENRON and most disturbing fact is the expenses ( G & A ,outside contractors ,consultant ...)

                      go up thru the roof . Since I am a contractor  I knew how much ENRON paid for such services , me and my wife were trying to do our parts by she

                      wrote and sent an e-mail to Mr Rick Causey suggesting ways to cut down outside contractor 's cost because whatever the savings will be

                      reflected directly to the bottom lines .

                       
                       Mr Lay , whatever happened we will allways trust you to steer ENRON into the right path and we truly wish you Health ,Prosperity and

                       Happiness to you and your family . Thank you for reading this e-mail . Sincerely , Joseph Nguyen .

"Potential solution","Dr. Lay,

Sir, I am almost positive that all avenues have been pursued to get Enron out of the hole we are in.  However, I wanted to inquire if a reverse stock split (perhaps a 12 to 1 or 15 to 1) was a possible option.  My knoweledge in terms of Enron's debt and who we are indebted to is limited to what I have heard through the media, but as I see it, many creditors are at a great risk to lose billions of dollars.  Would banks such as JP Morgan or Citigroup or others potentially affected such as Janus Funds or Lehman Brothers be willing to invest in equity rather than pump in more debt?  From my understanding, we need an immediate $4 billion, and I think this may be a potential solution to get instant cash, and then we can turn our interests to building customer and investor confidence.

I hope I am not wasting your time with this, but this is not the time for any of us involved with this company to remain silent.  Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely,
Suketu Patel

ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
January 2002, Number 25

REJECTING THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE
Sidney Weintraub

The turmoil that Argentina is now going through is so costly for the majority of the Argentinean population that it demands some answers to the question, ""Did it have to happen?"" The same question arose when the Mexican financial structure imploded in 1994. My single word answer in both cases is ""No."" In each case, the disaster followed a similar-although not identical-trajectory; and in each case the political and technical authorities made a bet that they could manage discredited practices. And, in each case, they failed, thereby visiting great suffering on their populations.

The precipitating event of the Argentine debacle was an overvalued and, ultimately, untenable exchange rate. The convertibility scheme adopted in 1991 was brilliant in its simplicity. By assuring the public that enough dollars were to be held in official reserves to cover the monetary base and thereby guarantee that pesos could be exchanged for dollars, on demand, even a skeptical public found the approach credible. Runaway inflation was stopped in its tracks. Overall economic growth rates soared, at least for a while. The technique was a variant of the Mexican experiment that began in 1987: using the exchange rate as the anchor to defeat inflation.

What ""did in"" the Argentine experiment was the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. This led, inevitably under one-to-one convertibility, to the appreciation of the Argentine peso, and despite the preaching of ideologues that it is immoral to alter an exchange rate, the price of a country's money-its exchange rate-does affect its exports and imports. On top of this, Brazil devalued its currency, the real, in 1999, and what Argentina faced was the appreciation of its currency while that of the country that took one-third of its exports depreciated. Argentina nevertheless retained the overvalued exchange rate and, in the process, further destroyed the country's competitive position. Inflation was kept in check, but the country has suffered economic downturn ever since.

This description omits other aspects of Argentina's economic, political, and social situation. These include relatively modest fiscal deficits (the public sector borrowing requirement averaged about 2 percent of GDP between 1991 and 1998, at the national and provincial levels combined); growing social inequality and poverty; too many feckless politicians who looked at government service as a source of enrichment; and reckless borrowing, public and private, domestic and foreign. Argentina met its debt obligations by more borrowing, but this was a large Ponzi scheme because the inability to earn enough foreign exchange from exports meant that the rigid one-to-one structure had to collapse, sooner or later.

Mexico, in 1987, adopted a form of price controls, under what was called a pacto de solidaridad, to lower its inflation. The pacto, or agreement, called for the private sector to limit price increases, labor to limit wage demands, and the government to control its expenditures. When the pacto started, Mexico devalued its currency sharply to leave room for appreciation of the peso in order to prevent devaluation from raising inflation. The pactos were kept in place, with annual modifications, from 1987 through 1994. The anchor for Mexico's anti-inflation policy was an increasingly overvalued peso. Inflation declined gradually, year after year, rather than abruptly as it did in Argentina after convertibility, but economic growth in Mexico in these years was modest.

As in Argentina, the Mexican political authorities (the president) and the technicians (the finance minister, with the cooperation of the head of the central bank) were unwilling to change the exchange-rate structure, a form of crawling peg. Instead, they took the risk that they could delay devaluation until some time in the future. There was general agreement that the Mexican peso was overvalued, and the way the authorities dealt with this in foreign borrowing was to issue short-term notes that had a dollar guarantee-the so-called tesobonos. This house of cards collapsed in December 1994, about three weeks after the previous president left office. The Mexican authorities gambled, and the population lost.

As in Argentina, there were other elements in the Mexican collapse. There were assassinations of political leaders during 1994; the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate six times during the year, seriously affecting Mexico; the government budget was kept in balance, but development banks were allowed to provide uncollected credit that amounted to some 3 percent of GDP; political corruption continued much as before; and foreign borrowing, on short terms and at dollar equivalents, rose sharply even as official reserves declined from capital flight and efforts to support the exchange rate. In the end, however, what did Mexico in was an overvalued exchange rate that was kept in place far too long.

In the case of Brazil, the scenario unfolded differently. The real plan was put in place in mid-1994 in an effort to reduce inflation without burdening economic growth. As in Mexico, in Brazil the stable exchange rate worked and inflation was reduced. Brazil weathered the tequila effect of December 1994, when the Mexican peso depreciated, without any sharp change in the real plan. However, Brazil was hit sharply by the aftereffects of the Russian debt default in 1998 because investors either had to cover positions or became nervous about keeping capital in Brazil given its precarious situation. In January 1999, Brazil devalued the real and took other corrective measures. Brazil did not have the turmoil that either Mexico or Argentina faced when they were forced to devalue under the most adverse circumstances. Brazil acted more quickly, before a deepening crisis made action exceedingly costly.

The currencies of Brazil and Mexico are both floating, and thus far, the mechanism is working. Argentina has announced that it will allow its currency to float for domestic transactions but that it will be controlled for foreign trade. That is, Argentina will have a dual exchange- rate system, justified by the assertion that because the one-to-one structure was in effect for so long, the country needed six months for moving to a single, floating currency. Argentina's new president, Eduardo Duhalde, has also stated that the country's opening to imports has been a disaster and that trade policy will become more nationalistic (protectionist).

At this point, two comments. Dual exchange rates have a history of failure, especially by abetting corruption. Argentina has tried protectionism before, especially under Juan Per?n, and it did little other than to increasingly impoverish the country. In the interest of Argentina's future, one can only hope that the dual exchange-rate system does not last very long and that the economic nationalism will not be too severe.

The deeper issue is to ask why government leaders pursue policies that have a history of failures. This is a task for psychologists, not economists, but I will give it a try.

		?	It is politically unpopular to devalue a currency; therefore, why not push off the unpleasantness for as long as possible? The suffering for doing this will come later, perhaps on someone else's watch.
?	Memories are short-those of the politicians and technicians who repeat past mistakes, and of the general public. In addition, memories often gild the past, forgetting that Latin America's poverty and inequality were created during periods of past protectionism.
?	Intelligent leaders become wedded to policies they put in place and are often emotionally unable to change what they have been doing. Domingo Cavallo was fabulously successful as economics minister in Argentina in the early part of the 1990s and dismally incorrect in his actions when he returned in the De la R?a government in the same position. In Mexico, in 1994, both President Salinas and Finance Minister Pedro Aspe were so adamant about not devaluing the peso that they excluded technicians from policy deliberations when they did not agree with this position.

It is understandable that many analysts and business leaders prefer fixed exchange rates. When things are going well, this provides a degree of certainty. However, the time to judge the effectiveness of an exchange-rate mechanism is when the system is under pressure. This explains the attractiveness of floating exchange rates for countries prone to economic shocks. It is clear from what is happening in Argentina and what took place in Mexico in 1994 that fixed rates-even a relatively hard fix of the type that Argentina had-can spell disaster when a country is under economic pressure. Perhaps this lesson will stick-at least for a time.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Cooler Houston Project/ Follow-Up to Denver Discussion","May 29, 2001

Dear Ken:

It was great to see you in Denver.  The group of  leaders from the Western
Governors' Association and major businesses  were energized to take control
of their destiny, and your ideas contributed enormously.  I think that you
and I are very much on the same page regarding the President's Energy Report
and the opportunities that it presents.  In addition, Joe Romm and I have
worked  a bit with the Enron Energy Services team on some initial ways to
highlight and quantify the ""green"" aspects of the EES product.  You are well
positioned to prove what initiatives bring both business and
energy/environmental benefits.

Per our discussion, I have attached below a copy of a confidential
preliminary report on the potential for a ""Cooler Houston"" initiative.  The
scientific models relating to ""urban heat island effects"" indicate that
planting trees, lightening the color of roofs and resurfacing pavement with
lighter material can reduce ambient high temperatures in Houston and thus
potentially lead to ozone reductions far cheaper than the cost of the ""last
mile"" tons indicated in current SIP efforts.  Success requires developing
some technical agreement and common cause among U.S. EPA, TNRCC, the City of
Houston, and business and civic leaders in the City.  Bill White and the
leadership of the Greater Houston Partnership have been spearheading early
work on this.  Our team is working with U.S. EPA and TNRCC to see if they
can agree on the models.

 We would be very interested in your ideas on this.  Moreover, if the
technical people can agree in concept, we would value your support of an
achievable Cooler Houston plan going forward.  Naturally, the plan is
exciting because it offers economic, air quality and broader quality-of-life
benefits to the Houston community.  Ever since we developed the acid rain
trading program, I have enjoyed promoting such ideas!

Please let me know anything else that you need.  I hope to see you soon.  In
the meantime, best wishes to you and the family.

Sincerely,

Hank Habicht

> EMEA CS Channels Marketing and Sales
> In terms of dollars, these marketing activities in some of our smaller
> EMEA countries may not have the largest impact, but they do provide a
> tremendous boost to the business locally. They also highlight excellent
> examples of best practices that can be leveraged by other countries.
> *	Portugal - CarePaq Outbound Telemarketing Campaign - A trial program
> involving a dedicated local Call Centre agent contacting 800 pre-screened
> warranty-only customers approaching the end of the first year of warranty
> resulted in the sale of 129 new CarePaqs (17% conversion). Plans are to
> roll out this program in other EMEA countries.
> *	Finland - Electronic CarePaq Growth - Three-fourths of all CarePaq
> sales in Finland are now in the form of electronic CarePaq sales. A May
> Day advertising campaign in national press featuring eCarePaq alongside
> hardware resulted in 600 new eCarePaq sales equating to an incremental
> CarePaq attachment rate increase of 5%. As other EMEA Countries mirror
> Finland's leadership position on eCarePaq penetration, similar campaigns
> are planned.
> *	South Africa - iPAQ CarePaq Bundle - To provide further competitive
> differentiation and to improve customer satisfaction, CS Channels
> Management in South Africa has agreed to bundle a one-year Advance
> Exchange CarePaq on iPAQ handhelds, which is forecast to improve CarePaq
> revenue by $270K or 25% for the year.
> *	Spain - Presario Bundle - To drive customer satisfaction and loyalty
> and to provide a unique differentiator in the marketplace, Spain will
> bundle a 2-year, pick-up and return, five-business-day CarePaq on all
> Presario portable sales. Initially, 6,500 are planned to ship in May, with

"FW: Change of Control Provisions","There is no denying that these are difficult times, and it is all to easy in this day and age to overlook the  accomplishments that this Company has acheived in both business and the greater communities that it has served over the years.  Yes, the financial impact has affected us all, but as I look back over my thirteen years of employment and the multiple moves that my family has sacrificed for me, I would no doubt do it all again because of the wealth that I have gained in the area of friends, knowledge and work experience of being an ENRON EMPLOYEE. I look foward to the future and in no way ever look down upon the past.
 
Always remember that great leader are defined in trying times, and therefore I wanted to thank you for your Leadership.

Subject: Change of Control Provisions




As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

RELEVANT TO THE NEWS

On January 10, the U.S. began transferring Al Qaeda prisoners from Afghanistan to a U.S. base in Cuba. Soon officials must decide how to try detainees who are suspected terrorists. A presidential order signed November 13 allows for the use of military tribunals, and a number of AEI scholars have argued in favor of the decision:

The message boards look really good today. There are
one or two bad guys, but they are the shorts and
everyone else is betting on stock back in the 20's
before the weekend and a turnaround. The general
consensus is Enron is still a good company with good
earnings and this is a great time to buy.
Love You Dad,

3. ""Will Encryption Protect Privacy and Make Government Obsolete?"" --

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE PEARL HARBOR DECEPTION

The creators of ""Pearl Harbor"" -- the new movie debuting Friday that
Hollywood insiders are calling ""'Titanic' with fighter planes"" --
have missed a vital aspect of Pearl Harbor history.

Although the movie's emphasis is on entertainment, not historical
enlightenment, during the film's production Jerry Bruckheimer, the
producer, made sure to consult Pearl Harbor survivors, historians,
and government officials. But one perspective he never took seriously
is one based on secret U.S. documents recently declassified under the
Freedom of Information Act.

""Overwhelming evidence contained in the May 2000 Freedom of
Information Act release,"" writes Robert B. Stinnett in the new
paperback edition of his book DAY OF DECEIT: The Truth About FDR and
Pearl Harbor, ""reveals that by mid-November 1941, as Japanese naval
forces headed for Hawaii, America's radio cryptographers had solved
the principal Japanese naval codes and that Japan's top admirals went
on the Japanese naval airwaves and in a series of radio messages
disclosed that Pearl Harbor was the target of their raid.""

""Based on these transmissions, President Roosevelt and General George
Marshall predicted war with Japan would begin the first week of
December. We would know even more about what FDR and his chief
advisors thought, but the Japanese radio messages remain incomplete,
still cloaked in American censorship.... By continuing to classify
Japanese naval intercepts and their communication decoding data as
'national defense secrets,' the National Security Agency (NSA) has
done a disservice to the excellent cryptographers and the radio
intelligence obtained by monitor stations operated by the United
States and her allies in 1941, as well as to history itself.""

""Nevertheless,"" concludes Stinnett, ""the major secrets of Pearl
Harbor are at last out in the open. After years of denial, the truth
is clear: we knew.""

Unfortunately, this truth will not be coming soon to a theater near you.

See Robert B. Stinnett's op-ed, ""December 7, 1941: A Setup from the Beginning""

CHALLENGING THE FTC's HOSTILITY TO MERGERS

Although the Microsoft antitrust trial loomed largest in the public
consciousness, it was not the only important antitrust trial in
recent years. Another antitrust case -- the Federal Trade
Commission's successful challenge to the merger of two office-supply
""superstores"" -- will have far-reaching effects, even if the
Microsoft case is ultimately thrown out on appeal.

The FTC prevented a proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot by
arguing that a merger would raise the price of office supplies,
citing evidence that office-supply prices were significantly higher
in cities with only one company operating office-supply superstores.

The defense accepted this evidence as true, but argued that higher
prices were explained by higher costs in one-firm markets. What they
didn't do, according to the judge, was to offer a unifying theory to
explain why one-firm markets might have higher costs. Economist Craig
M. Newmark offers such a theory, based on what economists call
""indivisibility rents,"" in a new Independent Institute working paper.

In essence, Newmark argues that the whole point of superstores is to
have a store large enough to minimize the costs of transportation,
advertising, and the like. In markets that can only support one
store, the market is often too small to minimize these costs. Hence,
the higher prices in these markets.

This theory, presented above in the sketchiest fashion, is consistent
with other evidence presented by the FTC. Markets having only two
office supply superstore chains were notably smaller than those with
three firms, suggesting that indivisibility was a factor.
Unfortunately, the FTC apparently didn't consider indivisibility in
its analysis.

""The indivisibility theory implies that the higher prices in one-firm
markets are not due to lack of competition; the merger should not
raise prices.""

Consumers and their representatives, then, should let the FTC know
that a knee-jerk hostility to mergers isn't in the public interest.
Checking for indivisibility should be a staple of FTC analysis.

See ""The Positive Correlation of Price and Concentration in Staples:
Market Power or Indivisibility?"" by Craig M. Newmark, Independent
Institute Working Paper #31, at
http://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink3-20-4.html.

""WILL ENCRYPTION PROTECT PRIVACY AND MAKE GOVERNMENT OBSOLETE?"" --
David Friedman Transcript Now Online

Someone once said that the move toward civilization coincided with
the move toward privacy.

New advances in information technology allow the possibility of
greater privacy, but they also make it easier for government
bureaucrats, criminals, and other unwanted intruders to snoop into
your private life. Will privacy-enhancing technology outpace
privacy-threatening technology? Will freedom and civilization thereby
advance? Or will the new technology strengthen the rule of Big
Brother?

Economist and legal scholar David D. Friedman addressed these and
related issues in his recent Independent Policy Forum talk, ""Will
Encryption Protect Privacy and Make Government Obsolete?"" -- a
transcription of which is now available on the Independent Institute
website.

Leery of predicting the future, Prof. Friedman said that he would not
forecast beyond 30 years -- after that, all bets are off. For the
coming three decades, however, he predicts that ""public key
encryption,"" a young technology increasingly used in e-commerce, is
likely to promote privacy -- unless the government acts immediately
to control its use.

Rather than control what people do with personal information about
you, public key encryption lets you decide with whom you want to
share that information. With it, we can better ensure that financial
information, health records, and other information will only go to
those we deem are on a need-to-know basis.

Further, public key encryption -- along with e-mail re-mailers -- can
promote anonymity, making it increasingly possible for you to buy and
sell over the Internet without the taxman knowing about it. And
""anonymous"" companies in cyberspace can easily build a solid
reputation needed to gain a loyal customer base. Thus we may soon
have an underground cyber-economy that rivals the size of underground
economy in the real world.

Public key encryption also acts as a virtual Second Amendment,
according to Friedman. Just as the Second Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution institutionalized the self-defense of the citizenry
against a federal tyranny, so public key encryption will
institutionalize the self-defense of the citizenry against government
propaganda. Americans (and citizens of other countries) will be
better armed with the truth. Information about government
encroachment will be easier to spread and thereby help keep it in
check.

For a transcript of David Friedman's talk, ""Will Encryption Protect
Privacy and Make Government Obsolete?"" see

"A Reflection on Memorial Day","
 
 
 We approach  another 'Holiday Weekend' and far too many will  forget the reason for ""Memorial Day"".
A comrade from years ago, now living in Bangkok, sends  this address, really a prayer, that puts the day we honor our heroes in perspective. It was  delivered at the close of World War II , on an island that saw some of the fiercest fighting of that terrible war. The message is timeless.
 
Jack Rains
Houston
***************************************************************************************************************************************************
14 March 1945 
 
U.S. Marine Corps, 5th Division, Cemetery, Iwo Jima Composed and delivered by Rabbi R. B. Gittlesohn, Chaplain, U.S.M.C. 
 
This is perhaps the grimmest, and surely the holiest, task we have faced since D-Day.  Before us lie the bodies of comrades and friends.  Men, who until yesterday or last week, laughed with us, trained with us, men who were on the same ships with us, and went over the sides with us as we prepared to hit the beaches on this island, men who fought with us and feared with us. 
 
Somewhere in this plot of ground there may lie the man who could have discovered the cure for cancer.  Under one of these Christian Crosses, or beneath a Jewish Star of David, there may rest now a man who was destined to be a great prophet ... to find the way, perhaps, for all to live in plenty. 
Now they lie here silently in this sacred soil, and we gather to consecrate this earth in their memory. 
 
To speak in memory of such men as these is not easy.  Of them, too, can it be said with utter truth: ""The world will little note nor long remember what we say here.  It can never forget what they did here.""  These men have done their job well.  They have paid the ghastly price of freedom.  If that freedom be once again lost, as it was after the last war, the unforgivable blame will be our, not theirs.  So it is we, the living, who are here to be dedicated and consecrated. 
 
We dedicate ourselves, first, to live together in peace the way they fought and are buried in this war.  Here lie men who loved America because their ancestors generations ago helped in her founding, and other men who loved her with equal passion, because they themselves or their fathers escaped from oppression to her blessed shores.  Here lie officer and men, Blacks and Whites, Protestants and Catholics and Jews, together.  Here no man prefers another because of his faith or despises him because of his color. 
 
Any man among us, the living, who fails to understand that, will thereby betray those who lie here dead.  To this, then, as our solemn, sacred duty, do we the living now dedicate ourselves: To the right of Protestants, Catholics and Jews, of White and Black men alike, to enjoy the democracy for which all of them have here paid the price. 
 
To one thing more do we consecrate ourselves in memory of those who sleep beneath these crosses and stars.  This war, with all its frightful heartache and suffering, is but the beginning of our generation's struggle for democracy.  When the last battle has been won, there will those at home, as there were last time, who will want us to turn our backs in selfish isolation on the rest of organized humanity, and thus to sabotage the very peace for which we fight.  We promise to you who lie here: We will not do that! 
 
When the last shot has been fired, there will still be those whose eyes are turned backward, not forward, who will be satisfied with those wide extremes of poverty and wealth in which the seeds of another war can be sown.  We promise you, our departed comrades: This, too, we will not permit.  This war has been fought by the common man!  We promise, by all that is sacred and holy, that your sons, the sons of miners and millers, the sons of farmers and workers, will inherit from your death the right to a living that is decent and secure. 
 
Thus do we memorialize those who, having ceased living with us, now live within us.  Thus do we consecrate ourselves, the living, to carry on the struggle they began.  Too much blood has gone into this soil for us to let it lie barren.  Too much pain and heartache have fertilized the earth on which we stand.  We here solemnly swear: This shall not be in vain!  Out of this, and from the suffering and sorrow of those we mourn, this will come, we promise, the birth of a new freedom for the sons of men everywhere. 
 
Amen

"Pipeline problem","
Dear Ken,
I apologize for bothering you with this kind of a nuisance, however I hope  you can help my friend. I called you a year ago about  problems dealing with the Houston Pipeline group. I am appealing to you again.  
 
I was contacted to provide nitrogen gas for a  pipeline pigging project last year on a 20"" line that goes south from Corpus  Christi. Rusty Bellflower told me I was  going to provide the nitrogen and then after my group was mobilized on short  notice over a weekend, they cancelled - did not even call us, just never called  back. I spent a week on the project and my subcontractor was out his  mobilization cost, and after more than a year, they finally paid a part of our  cost.
 
During the negotiation for the nitrogen set up, I  visited the pipeline site, and saw some oil on the ground. I mentioned to the  HPL rep Rusty Bellflower, that I had a biological product that is excellent for  eliminating oil. He called in a big rush on a Friday afternoon and said for me  to hot shot 10 or so drums of the stuff to a site on the beach (10 pigs or  something) where they would put the chemical into the 20"" pipeline. He even gave  me a PO number (X000496) A week later he called and said they decided not to use  the chemical. I told him we were going to charge for restocking and the cost for  hot shot services. 
 
Rusty said that if we charged them anything we  could be sure that we would never work for HPL or Enron again.
 
That is my experience with HPL. 
 
Now my friend Jay Pope with Coastline Resources is  also having trouble on his part of the pipeline work. Nick Cocavessis of HPL  contacted Jay and asked Jay to bid the pigging job. A few things went wrong, but  most of them were a result of bad decisions on the part of the HPL personnel.  Why did they call a small outfit like Coastline in the first place? It looks  like they called them so they could muscle them around at the end of the job.  Jay Pope has been able to reduce the balance due to the subcontractors to  $2,780,000.  Enron is offering $2,550,000. Enron attorney (Andy  Edison) said ""Tell Jay he'll just have to chiselanother $ 230,000.00 out  of the sub's""
 
I am a stockholder in Enron, but I do not see the  sense in beating up contractors. Is there anything you can do to get the old HPL  group to settle with Jay?
 
Thank you for looking at this.

"Some Quick Fixes for the Economy","Senator Gramm,

I expect you have already considered these:
1.  Rebate surpluses out of the Airline trust fund that is a collection of
taxes on airline tickets.  This in addition to stopping the taxes would
provide needed liquidity to the airlines.

2.  Accelerate depreciation, perhaps to two or three years, on all capital
goods purchased before March 31, 2001.  This would provide a very strong
incentive for capital investment immediately.

3.  Defer all corporate taxes due for the next six months and make them
payable, with interest equal to AFR, over the next two years.  This would
effectively put the government in the position of lending to corporations at
the federal government's borrowing rate.  The net effect over two years is
neutral, except for potential defaults, but the fiscal impact is
significant.

Good Luck, we need more public officials of your ilk up there.  Sorry that
you won't be there much longer.

Regards,
Mark

Hello family and  friends.  I just received this message from, Youri, a friend of mine in  Europe.  He explains that this photo was apparently taken by a tourist  moments before the terrorist airline crash into the World Trade Center and that  the film/camera was found in the ruble and obviously developed.  If this is  real... can you imagine!!!!!!!!!  Totally disturbing, totally  unreal.

relatively young man. (At least in spirit). Please take care of yourself
during the challenging time. Get your checkups and take your vitamins.
As I said during Thanksgiving, you have excellent genes but I am sure
you're being required to stretch even your limits right now.

We are just fine.  We enjoyed seeing you and being with the family so
much over Thanksgiving.  I am certainly glad you ordered such good
weather. We seemed to have brought it back here this week as we are
really having spring weather. I have just returned from my run to the
University gym where I worked out on the weight machines, talked to a
few friends, and ran home. My knees are a little creaky, but they still
work. John is supervising a new septic tank at the farm this week and
will return to Columbia tomorrow. I will facilitate a planning retreat
at the University next week so I must spend some of my time working on
that and also managing rental property.

I think it is good for us to get together when we can. When you get out
of this crisis, give us a call and maybe we can come to Houston for a
weekend, (Probably after the first of the year). In the meantime, our
thoughts and prayers are with you. Always love, Sister Bonnie

"Hope you got my ""Earnest Seed"" 2 Cor 5:5","
Interesting what God had me read this morning in my walk. Malachi (the whole book), Genesis 1, and 1 Cor 13. 
The Malachi reading was a hard reading but as always God shows His mercy. Oh and also, He had me read Exodus 33:7-23. I just LOVE that passage!
Yesterday's reading was Hosea 10 through the end of the book. It was a hard reading too but God has me seeing so much about His salvation. 
Probably the biggest thing He has in my heart towards ya'll is really how David felt about God in that when things looked the darkest for him and He had sinned before the Lord, he went before God to cry out for God's mercy. I see how Moses ALWAYS cried out for the people. God wants us to know how merciful He is. If he counted our wrongs against us we would ALL perish!! 
As I was reading Hosea yesterday, it occurred to me how much we worship or look to the ""idols we make with our hands"". Then I could see how God wants us to tear those down and turn to Him but it occurred to me that the idol of ""self"" is always with us. How do we really realize that He alone is our source. We say it but to never even whisper in our hearts that ""I did this. This is the work of MY hands."" How can we tear that idol down? Then it hit me - God tears down that idol for us. It takes God to bring things into our life to deliver us from this idol. 
I just pray that God will show you His heart towards you in what is being said. That His still small voice will minister the passionate desire and love He has for you. That He is with you. That He will work all of this together for good in your life because you are called according to His purpose.  Even the ""hard sayings"" will minister an affection that will bring from you a,  ""Yes, Lord, You alone are my God. I will have no other Gods before You. I am the sheep of Your pasture. It is You that has made me and not me myself. I love you too, Lord. I am counting on your mercy and compassion and I need to hear the ""abundance of rain"" so that I know what you want me to do.""
Remember, you are Your Beloved's and He is yours...(Song of Solomon 2:16).""

"KUDLOW'S TAKE -- National Review Online Financial -- October 1, 2001","
KUDLOW'S TAKE
by Lawrence Kudlow


DECLARING WAR ON RECESSION
Why isn't the administration endorsing bold measures?

October 1, 2001 8:00 a.m.


Crucial to winning the global war against terrorism is a bold plan to wage
war on the domestic recession. But Washington has no such plan. Respected
policymakers look timid, cautious, and out of touch with the reality of a
declining economy. Veteran graybeards advise Congress to do nothing,
seemingly deaf to an economic call to arms.

The latest unemployment claims report ratcheted up nearly 60,000 to
450,000 - a nine-year high. This implies a huge drop in jobs and a big jump
in unemployment is on the way. A just published and miserable durable-goods
report says the technology sector is evaporating in cyberspace. Over the
three months ending in August, a composite high-tech index for shipments
dropped 50.1% at an annual rate. Technology was the biggest contributor to
the economic boom of the 1990s. Now it is the biggest drag. Even consumers
are suffering from terrorist aftershock as weekly chain-store sales are
turning negative.

Something has got to be done, but Washington isn't doing it. The Bush
administration's economic officials have been ineffectual. There is no
action-plan script, no talking points, no communication strategy. In short,
there's no leadership on the domestic economic front. The administration is
performing brilliantly in the early stages of the war against terrorism. But
thus far, it has shown no similar instincts in the war against domestic
recession.

If the domestic slump is left unattended, the nation will eventually become
demoralized. Without economic vitality at home, it will be all the more
difficult to maintain our edge overseas. Rising unemployment drains the
spirit, but we need exactly that spirit to conquer our enemies.

The economy needs a jolt. It needs risk-taking. But policymakers seem
unwilling to take risks. Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan - who keep telling
us that too much stimulus will cause inflation - are providing more
status-quo thinking at the very moment we need leaders who can size up the
current situation and then think outside the box to provide solutions.

Mr. Rubin's arguments about budget surpluses and long-term bond rates are
red herrings at best. Actually, as the recession-driven federal budget moves
into deficit, Treasury market interest rates are dropping to 40-year lows,
undercutting Rubin's entire argument on the need to maintain budget
surpluses at any economic cost. He has never understood that growth produces
surpluses, rather than the other way around. The former Clinton Treasury man
tells us that demand-side consumer tax rebates are okay while supply-side
tax cuts on successful high-end earners and capital investments are not. Go
figure. This is not economic analysis. It's a plain vanilla,
liberal-redistribution agenda.

Mr. Greenspan, meanwhile, says that capital-gains tax cuts are not the best
way to deal with the economy's short-term problem. Yet it is exactly the
deflation of capital asset values through the stock-market decline and the
deepening slump in business profits that cries out for new incentive rewards
for capital investment. Instead of pompous proclamations, let's do an
historical scrub of the after-effects of cap-gains relief. If we do, it will
show that faster economic growth, rising stock markets, and stronger budget
revenues always follow lower tax-rates on capital investment.

Jack Kemp and Sen. Zell Miller have it exactly right in their editorial
proposal to slash cap gains, accelerate the depreciation of investment in
plant, equipment, and technology, and make the phased-in personal tax-rate
reductions effective immediately. Their monetary view that the Federal
Reserve should abandon its interest rate target in favor of larger emergency
cash injections is also correct.

So, why aren't administration economists endorsing these bold measures? Why
aren't they making the case that it's business that creates jobs, and that
business desperately needs a fresh capital infusion? No amount of consumer
tax rebates will stop the unemployment rate from rising if capital-starved
and profit-losing businesses don't get immediate relief from a permanent
reduction of tax-rates. Bush policymakers should also make the case that the
twin crises of war and recession will require a temporary budget deficit of
roughly 1.5% of GDP ($150 billion) to finance tax-cuts, defense, and
infrastructure-rebuilding policies that are necessary to re-ignite economic
growth.

The public is four-square behind the president in the global war against
terrorism. It will also stand four-square behind the president in the war
against recession. Indeed, the public knows that a strong domestic economy
is vital to the war effort. Since President Bush's spectacular speech
rallying the nation for the global war against terrorism, the Dow Jones
stock index has appreciated 7%, or roughly 600 points. If the president
rallies the nation with a war plan to end recession, the market will rise
exponentially, signaling economic recovery and the revival of the American
spirit.

Mr. Lay
Have you ever been sucker punched?  In case you haven't let me describe it to you.  First you are stunned and shocked because you didn't see it coming.  Then you realize that you can't breath because the wind has been knocked out of you.  Then you get mad when it sinks in that something like this could have happened to you.  Well Ken!  The employee's of Enron know what it is like because it just happened to us. 
     You asked one thing of the people that work for you.  To make Enron the worlds leading energy company.  We gave that to you and what did we get in return?  
     I can handle a few bad investments and a downturn in the economy affecting the price of our stock.  What I can't handle is everything else that we are reading about in the national news every day.
     Every month in our team meetings we go over Enrons vision and values and describe what each one means to us.  Little did we know that we were the only ones paying attention to what they stood for. Can you tell me what each one means to you right now.  RESPECT?    INTEGRITY?    COMMUNICATION?    EXCELLENCE?   
     I am trying to keep my head up when people ask me what happened but it is getting harder all the time.  I have stopped trying to defend you and the others that are involved.  
     I have been proud to work for this company for 21 years and now because of something out of my control it is all gone.  You made more in 1 year then I have made in my career with Enron.  You decided that you wouldn't take that 60 million dollars if  the merger with Dynegy didn't go through.  What about my 600 thousand dollars that I have saved for the last 21 years.  I have watched it's value drop to less the two thousand.  Did I have a choice?  Yes I could have sold off some of my stock, but why would I do that when Skilling was telling us it would be over 100 dollars by now.
One other feeling you will never realize is After 21 years I was standing at the end of the rainbow just to watch my pot of gold snatched away from me by the very people I trusted the most.

"Employee Morale","Mr. Lay,

	My name is Stephen Perich and I am an analyst working in Gas Trading.  I just wanted to write you and give you an update on the mood here on the floor, which I expect can be found throughout the company given the current situation.  Although we continue to work and perform our jobs, I have been hearing some comments that suggest some people might be giving up.  When small problems arise, one can hear, ""Don't worry about it, it doesn't matter now anyway.""  That kind of attitude at this time is detrimental, what we should be seeing is extra effort to try and reverse the situation.  
	I would never presume to know how a CEO should act in these circumstances.  In fact, I know that you must have a good idea how to handle these situations, or you would not be the leader of this great company.  However, I do know that you are still our leader, and we look to you and trust you to do your best.  I have faith that you are doing your best, and I can imagine how difficult your job is right now.  But I think there are some who might be starting to question management's decisions, and even if those decisions are contingent upon a concern for the employees' interests.  I think this can be solved through one of our core values, COMMUNICATION.  I am sure that whatever is going on right now is speculative and that no one is sure of anything, and that is exactly what we are hearing from CNBC.  But I don't think that the employees want to hear it from CNBC, they would like to hear it from their leader.  Even if nothing is concrete, you have no definitive answers, and you really have no idea what is going to happen, just send us an email saying, ""I know you are all on edge about what is going on, but right now I have nothing concrete to report, I have no definitive answers, and I really don't have any idea what will happen, but I will let you know as soon as I do.""  I can't emphasize how much it would mean for the employees to hear that.  
	I also would like to thank you for your hard work, I can imagine you are enduring stress which none of us are familiar with.  But please remember that you are CEO for a reason, be confident in your abilities and in those of you subordinates, and continue to work hard.  Thanks again and good luck. 

Sincerely,

SP

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

So here is my idea...

Being that I'm a simple housewife, I tend to be more consumed with my day to day life than with the plight of the USA.  So, as a constant reminder to the average Jane like me, I would like President Bush to keep the US flag at half mast until Osama Bin Laden is brought to justice.  So  that every time I pass a flag, I will remember the thousands of people that died and still might die due to terrorism.  And when justice is finally served, I think it would be a great way to celebrate by all of the US raising our flags (our heads) up high.  I have never asked anyone to forward anything in my life.  Please,  just this one time,  could you forward this, so maybe somewhere, the powers that be might will consider doing this.  Thank you very much.

"Update on Defense of Houston - Meeting","Memo to Disaster Relief Advisory Board (persons that do not have email
will receive correspondence by fax)
---------------

Thank you so much for your enthusiasm and your ideas.  Many things have
been suggested that I had not thought of, but I think before we put
these on a bulletin board we should issue passwords to protect the
information, for that matter, the advisory board members.

We will call you on a landline to give you your password.  This will
take a little time with so many advisory board members.

Another thing that will take a little time is insuring the security of
the group in any meeting we might have.  Dr. Wainerdi has kindly offered
to have the meeting in a secure site within the Texas Medical Center and
Ambassador Djerejian and I feel best to re-schedule the meeting that we
were talking about holding at the Baker Institute at 2 p.m. on Friday
September 28.  Instead, we will get some advice from the FBI as to
whether there are any immediate local security concerns and if so, how
best to mitigate them.  Meanwhile, we will get everyone a password so
that we can do some secure planning before a face-to-face meeting is
ever held.  This will make better use of the time of busy people.

I thought I would answer a couple critical questions that have been
asked:

Why Defense of Houston?  Isn't there already enough overlap of agencies?

We conceived of Defense of Houston as mainly a medical group to improve
the medical response in case of any terrorism or other medical
disasters.  I have been working here for 9 years and have been involved
in some disasters like the flood, but no one here has ever been in
anything like what happened at the World Trade Center.  At best we can't
say with confidence that we are prepared.  Indeed, every single national
study (and there have been 3 in the past year alone) says that we are
not prepared and points to communication, coordination, training, and
public education as the most pressing needs.

We have enough trouble keeping communication open with our sister
institutions  (Memorial Hermann Hospital, St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital,
the Texas Heart Institute, and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center), and we know
from experience that communication with the rest of the medical center,
and with doctors and hospitals outside the medical center, is harder
still.  Despite the outstanding efforts of the Houston Fire Department's
Medical Director, Dr. David Persse, communication is not always smooth
and equipment and training are not optimal, even though they are better
than in most cities.

Since we need to do more, the question is who should do it, and how.
The doctors and scientists in the medical center don't have all the
answers, but have learned over the past few days that some great common
sense questions and solutions have come from non-technical people
outside the medical center.  Moreover, every member of this advisory
board is a stake holder and has the right to know if the medical
response system is adequate.

Moreover, the advisory board members are leaders in the community, both
directly and indirectly, are educators.

Finally, a large and representative group will help medical center
institutions not only by their advice, their questions and needs, but by
their support of the work we are doing.  This includes the need to more
research to develop better sensors, vaccines, and therapies, all which
will benefit from federal support and federal support for such projects
- in the Texas Medical Center and beyond - is more likely and the public
and its leaders are united and one day speak out.

Defense of Houston is not intended compete with or distract the other
important groups work in this area which include the Houston Task Force
on Counter-Terrorism at the Baker Institute (leaders are members of the
Defense of Houston and vice-versa) or the many important city, county,
state and federal agencies.  Defense of Houston is an attempt to improve
our medical readiness.  Because we ourselves could be targets, we have
to know a little bit about how these other agencies can protect us and
how we can help protect ourselves.

More specifically, we expect to leave all the policy issues to the
Houston Task Force on Counter-Terrorism.  This would include the
""upstream"" issues such as analysis of the root causes of terrorism, of
diplomatic efforts, of inter-agency cooperation, of leadership of
public-private efforts, etc.  The Baker Institute also plays an
important educational role.

In contrast, Defense of Houston will focus on optimizing the medical
response, and secondarily, on public education that is part of the
mission of the medical schools here.

Thirdly, Defense of Houston is interested in bolstering the capability
of the medical institutions to conduct the kind of critical research in
bio-sensors, public health surveillance, coordination of emergency care,
increased understanding of biological and chemical agents and means to
inactivate them, to vaccinate against them, and to treat victims.

We have lots of news that will be available as soon as you have your
password.

Thanks again for your interest.  I am now convinced that we can make
Houston the safest city in the country.

Sincerely,

Ward

"Enron meeting","Gavyn Davies, via Helen Turley, has asked me to give you some guidance as to
what you might include in your presentations at the meeting on October 31st.
I do so with trepidation, since I am sure that you know more about your
subject than I do, so please regard the following merely as suggestions to be
ignored if you deem it appropriate to do so.
We have blocked out two hours (9-11AM) to discuss market opportunities for
Enron in Spain and Germany. My understanding is that Oscar will go first, as
he has a plane to catch. I would suggest that each of you plan on speaking
for about 30 (no more than 40) minutes, so as to leave time for questions
from what will be a lively audience of Enron executives.
You might want to begin with a general description of the political
situation, followed by a description of the present and future state of the
economy in each country. Then, you might turn to a more specific discussion
of matters of interest to Enron: the state of regulation and deregulation of
energy markets, the areas you consider should be of interest to Enron as
business opportunities, etc.
I do hope this is of help

"The Fog of War","============================================================
Greenfield at Large: Weeknights, 11:00 p.m. ET
Tuesday, January 08, 2002
============================================================

Here's the view from the ground in Afghanistan:

""...in Afghanistan you need more than smart bombs to win
a war; you need cash. You need to pay fighters so they
won't loot, you need to buy food so they won't steal it
and you need to purchase gas for their 4-by-4's. Most
crucially, you need cash to entice enemy commanders and
soldiers to switch sides...The going rate last fall was
several thousand dollars for a midlevel commander and as
little as $30 a head for soldiers.""

Here's another:

""'There was no al Qaeda group there,' Aji Akhter Jan said
of a U.S. airstrike Dec. 29 on a compound in eastern
Afghanistan. The Red Cross said the raid killed 52 people,
nearly half of them children. Jan, an elderly, but robust-
looking man who wears a black turban, Taliban-style, said
the Americans were misled by an informant with a grudge
against two extended families who lived there.""

Those reports came from the New York Times and USA Today,
respectively. They paint a picture of a nation where
alliances have less to do with the Taliban and the
Northern Alliance, and more to do with the Montagues and
Capulets, or perhaps the Hatfields and the McCoys.

Just this week, the 14-year-old suspected of shooting
Sgt. First Class Nathan Chapman has somehow disappeared
from the custody of the Afghan elders holding him.
Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar similarly seem to have
evaporated after Afghan forces reported having them
surrounded.

Can the U.S. trust its supposed allies there? And if
not, how can the U.S. military safely proceed in its
search for remaining al Qaeda pockets? Perhaps more
worrisome, how can stability take hold in an
environment where warring factions need chaos to
thrive?

Tonight, we'll hear from the reporters of those
stories, Peter Maass of the New York Times and
Steven Komarow of USA Today, as well as CNN Military
Analyst Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.). We hope you'll
join us.

"thank you","Before the day gets away from me, I wanted to once again tell you how much I truly appreciate you and your dedication to our company, shareholders and employees.  You did an outstanding job today.  You caused tears in my eyes during the last employee meeting and today when you shared your heartbreak related to what we are now going through my heart again went out to you.

There is so much I could say, but I think to sum up how I feel is simply to state again that I appreciate you and value your integrity, commitment and honesty.  I know there is probably so much you wanted to say, but for sound business reasons simply can not share today.  To be honest, I did walk away not fully motivated for the next struggle.  It is not a lack of trust, confidence or commitment, but it is simply a natural human response to another blow to our reputation that simply takes time to fully absorb and then move on in a postive and productive manner.  

You and all of Enron are in my prayers and I know that God will continue to keep his hand on you (and us) and guide us all through yet another personal growth opportunity.

Respectfully
Cynthia Barrow
Sr. Director of Benefits.

"Compaq Merger Interview with WSJ Today","Ken - Michael will be talking with this reporter tomorrow but he'd be
grateful if you could make 10 minutes to be our Board Voice for this
important interview in the Wall Street Journal.  I know you are only
available today at 4:30 p.m. so i am waiting for a response.  Here is
the background on the interview.  Let me know if you have any concerns
or questions. Thank you in advance. -- Grace Trent

Holman Jenkins at The Journal is working on his column ""Business World""
which will run next Wed on the editorial page.  He would like to capture
your view on why the merger is the right next step for Compaq and Compaq
shareholders.

Holman would like to present a Compaq rationale for the merger story and
his groundrules are to run ""near word for word"" the business case with a
working title of ""Why this deal is the right next move for Compaq and
Compaq shareholders.""  He will then weign-in as to whether he ""buys
into"" our rationale or not.  He is starting from a good/seemingly fair
mindset.  The reporter has a reputation for having strong personal
ethics and we have no reason to believe this will be a negative story.
In fact, Holman said that ""he is inclined to think this was a move made
for all the right reasons but for some reason the street hasn't
understood.""

Ken -  we need your help to underscore Michael's tenure, track record
and ability to get the integration done; all-the-while  being careful
that we don't paint a picture of Compaq's future that leaves the reader
with a sense of concern if the merger is unsuccessful.  We know there is
a risk of the headline being  ""the end of an era"" or worse, the end of a
great brand.""  But instead of the end, it is actually the beginning of
something great -- a better, strong company -- and as Carly said in the
Houston Chronicle last week, ""While Compaq will not be the
enterprise-wide brand for very pragmatic reasons, it does not mean the
end of the Compaq brand.""
Holman's Takeaway:
While we won't make this a point by point on the new HP Compaq vs. IBM
it is likely that his takeaway is that this deal is about creating a
viable alternative to IBM and why that is a good thing for the industry,
the customer and our global competitiveness.
Lastly, chemistry is important with Holman and this will be more of a
conversation that an interview. There could be issues that come up that
you'd like him to understand but won't want attributed to a Compaq
spokesperson. In that case, they should feel free to let him know you'd
like to share your thinking but would like to do so off-the-record.
I am specifically referring to the EU and regulatory landscape which
he'll have to ask about and we'll obviously want the public record to
reflect a somewhat humble comment about both companies commitment to go
through the entire process and address any concerns they may have.

"Confidence","I just wanted to let you know that I know that we are in a hot spot now, but I have all the confidence in you and Enron.

I trust in God, but I have a lot of confidence in you too.  You have kept Enron an ethical and decent company to deal with and to work for over the years.

 I was gone from the company (laid off 5 years ago) but returned 13 months ago and I just celebrated my tenth anniversary with the company and I would like to say that I am so proud to be back working for Enron.  Those five years I was gone, I never lost my allegiance to thecompany even though I was no longer an employee, I felt as though I was still a member of the Enron family.

I have always felt that Enron cared about its employees and in talking with some of my co-workers, those who have been here for a while, feel the same as I do.

I want to let you know that I am praying for you and the company and I know you will bring us through this time of trouble with God's help.

Keep your spitits up.

God bless you.

NEWPOWER IN THE NEWS  -   
NEWPOWER TESTS CONSERVATION TOOLS - [Philadelphia Business Journal, May 31.] The next time you forget whether you left the thermostat on, there's a chance you could turn it off with your cell phone.   You could, that is, if you're from one of 300 households in Philadelphia that will participate in one of three pilot programs that will link electricity meters to the Internet. http://philadelphia.bcentral.com/philadelphia/stories/2001/05/28/daily27.html 

NEWPOWER SEES SAVINGS FROM SMART ENERGY TECHNOLOGY - [Reuters, June 1.] NewPower said it will conduct three pilot programs in Philadelphia to test consumers' reaction to ""smart"" energy saving technology.  These new products require ""smart""' meters that tell  a ""smart""' device to operate when the cost of generating electricity is cheapest?"" Energy restructuring leads to technological innovation, efficiency and environmental benefits,""' said H. Eugene Lockhart, NewPower's president and chief executive officer.  ""`These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy needs."" http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010601/n0179210.html

ENERGY-SAVING TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IN PILOT PROGRAM - [Philadelphia Inquirer, June 1.] NewPower said it would launch three residential pilot programs in Philadelphia this month, to gauge consumer response to energy-saving technology.  The three programs will include 100 homes each and consist of a time-of-use metering pilot, a heating and air-conditioning control pilot, and a Web-based interactive pilot, which lets customers control their thermostat from any Web-enabled device. NewPower said it wanted to learn how consumers react to pricing and features of so-called demand-side management measures, and how to make them profitable. 	
NEWPOWER TO LEARN IMPACT OF HI-TECH METERS, CONTROLS ON CUSTOMERS LIVES - [Restructuring Today, June 1.] NewPower is taking the latest in DSM technology to the people in an effort to see how they react?.Tim Vail, NewPower's vice president of energy technology solutions, is not doing a technology beta test.   ""We want to learn consumer acceptance and responses to the products.""  A critical Vail target is learning how residential consumer lifestyles compare with load profiles so test volunteers will have to fill out a number of questionnaires about what they were doing at a given time.  The power industry has long bunched up ratepayers into classes using an average to picture typical use of customers.  ""We've got empirical data from a variety of sources but we want to get real world experience with it,"" Vail noted, a major departure from most metering pilots underway these days?""How do we take this technology and meld it into a product that consumers will want and use - that's the critical component of restructuring,"" he added?""Education is a major component of the whole piece for us,"" Vail said. 	

SAVING ENERGY IS HOT AGAIN - [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 3.] Not since the oil crisis of the 1970s has the public's interest in energy conservation seemed so high.  Even President Bush touts the value of conservation, despite criticism from environmentalists that his administration's policies rely too much on increased energy production and too little on energy efficiency and conservation. John Hangar, a former PUC member and current president of PennFuture, an environmental and consumer advocacy organization, wants electric utilities to install time-of-use meters in customers' homes. . . At least one company has leap-frogged over state regulators. NewPower began installing energy-saving technology in 300 households in the greater Philadelphia area.  ""These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the customer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy costs,"" said H. Eugene Lockhart, NewPower's president and chief executive officer. http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/20010603conservebiz3.asp 

TWO MARKETERS CUT NATURAL GAS PRICES - [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June 1.] Atlantans are getting a small break on their energy bills: Two leading Georgia natural gas marketers have reduced prices following a sharp drop in wholesale prices. No. 1 marketer Georgia Natural Gas Services reduced its variable price --- the price subject to monthly change --- for June by 4.5 percent. Shell Energy, the No. 3 marketer, marked down its fixed price, guaranteed for one year, by 5 percent and its variable price by 3 percent?NewPower, a new entrant in Georgia's unregulated natural gas market, is offering to lock in a gas price of 74.9 cents per therm for two years. That compares with one-year offers of 84.9 cents per therm from Georgia Natural Gas and 76.9 cents from Shell Energy. 

NEWPOWER TO START GAS SALES TO PG&E CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA - [Bloomberg, June 4.] NewPower is offering northern California residents two-year fixed-price natural-gas contracts to lure customers from PG&E Corp.'s gas utility.  In Sunnyvale, California, NewPower is offering is 98 cents a therm, or $9.80 per million British thermal units, and a $2.99 monthly fee, NewPower's Web site said. NewPower will offer gas service in 37 California counties, spokeswoman Gael Doar said. http://www.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?T=marketsquote99_news.ht&s=AOxv3sBTUTmV3UG93  

NATURAL GAS OFFERED AT FIXED RATE - [The Freemont Argus and Oakland Tribune, June 5] New York state-based NewPower is offering California residents a fixed-rate contract for natural gas, a commodity that saw big price spikes this past winter due to a supply shortage.  Residential customers in PG&E's service territory who commit to a two-year contract would pay 98 cents for each therm of natural gas. There would also be a monthly service fee of $2.99. http://www.argus-ang.com/default.asp?puid=16&spuid=16&indx=910116&article=on 

PRIX FIXE NATURAL GAS NOW AVAILABLE - [Contra Costa Times, June 5.]  With an offer of a two-year price guarantee, NewPower has set out to capture a portion of the retail natural gas market now served by the bankrupt utility unit of PG&E Corp. http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/leads/stories_one/enron_20010605.htm 

NEWPOWER OFFERS FIXED RATES - [Gas Daily, June 5.]  Gas customers in Pacific Gas & Electric's service territory can lock into a fixed rate with NewPower, a subsidiary of New Power Holdings.  The national gas and electric marketer yesterday began to offer  two-year fixed-rate to customers in several counties in Northern California.  ""NewPower is enormously pleased to provide California consumers, who've been buffeted by volatile energy prices, with a stable gas contract,"" said Eugene Lockhart, president and CEO of The New Power Co.
SELLING STABLE PRICES WORKS FOR NEWPOWER IN CALIFORNIA - [Restructuring Today, June 6.] Yes, the California market is open for retail gas competition.  It's been open for maybe a decade but few have found the market attractive until now.  NewPower is going in selling a two-year fixed price package that really appeals in today's world of price spiking. The fixed price insulates customers from price spikes in the volatile California marketplace. NewPower's Terri Cohen relates that the firm expects to sign up 16,000 customers.  They'll have the opportunity to lock in gas at 98? a therm, compared to an average PG&E price last January of $1.40 a therm.  The LDCs change their price monthly with a filing to the PUC based on what their costs have been.  NewPower's deal is available to retail customers in 37 northern California counties, including San Francisco and Sacramento. Before the announcement, NewPower already had 600,000 gas and electric customers in 19 markets.

OTHER ENERGY NEWS - NewPower shares news items weekly to inform employees about coverage of the energy industry.  Publication of a news clip is not an endorsement of its viewpoint or accuracy.

SURVEY SHOWS CUSTOMERS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVOR PRICE STABILITY - [Maxim Consulting Press Release, June 1.]  A nationwide survey shows that gas customers want their local gas utility to pursue strategies that will prevent future price spikes. The survey results also suggest ways for utilities to regain customer loyalty diminished in the wake of last winter's price increases. The results of the survey were recently presented to a group of utility executives and regulators at the New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissions. The survey shows that customers overwhelmingly prefer programs that mitigate price volatility, such as fixed price and capped price programs. http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CoXCtqbWbtKvgmdi0&FQ=%22maxim%20consulting%22&Nav=na-search-&StoryTitle=%22maxim%20consulting%22 

SHELL UNIT SIGNS DEAL ON NATURAL GAS PRICES - [Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 2.] Shell Energy Services Inc. yesterday became the next big player in Northeast Ohio's quickly changing utility services industry.  The Texas-based subsidiary of Shell Energy signed a one-year deal with Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council to provide discounted natural gas to customers in NOPEC communities across eight counties, beginning in September. http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news/991474210115554.xml 

9 CITIES UNITE FOR GREATER MIGHT  - [Boston Globe, June 3.] Imagine if nine Massachusetts cities combined their muscle to lower their health-care premiums and energy costs, and unify plans for affordable housing and developing jobs.  Those are among the hopes of city leaders who participated in a new cooperative effort that kicked off Wednesday.  At the meeting, officials from Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Melrose, Revere, and Somerville discussed ways their communities might be able to better work together. Possible areas of collaboration include joint purchasing and forging common strategies. http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/154/north/9_cities_unite_for_greater_mightP.shtml 

ON BUSH'S BRAND OF ENERGY DIVERSITY - [TIME.Com, June 4.] The Bush administration's national energy policy is meant to stimulate a national debate. It is certainly doing that. Whatever you believe about its recommendations, the report is a surprisingly well-crafted overview of America's energy situation. http://www.time.com/time/business/printout/0,8816,128829,00.html 

THE BATTLE OF CALIFORNIA - [Newsweek, June 4.] There are two dueling storylines for California's energy crisis. In the Gray Davis version a noble public servant who inherited a flawed electricity deregulation scheme from his Republican predecessor is trying to defend California's shellshocked consumers against the depredations of greedy ""out of state"" energy producers and an uncaring White House. In the Republican scenario, a desperate politician, worried about his falling poll numbers, is trying to shift the blame to the White House. http://www.msnbc.com/news/582445.asp#BODY

ELECTRICITY USAGE SHRINKS BY 11% - [San Francisco Chronicle, June 4.] By turning off lamps, turning up thermostats and buying energy-efficient light bulbs, the people of California helped reduce the state's electricity consumption last month 11 percent below the May 2000 level, more than was expected, Davis administration officials said yesterday. 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/06/04/MN183543.DTL 

BINGAMAN, SENATE ENERGY CHIEF, WILL BLOCK BUSH PRODUCTION PLAN - [Bloomberg, June 5.] Bush opposes caps on energy prices; Bingaman is cosponsor of legislation to impose caps on wholesale energy prices in California although, according to a spokesman, he'd prefer the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do that on its own. 
Bingaman says rather than offer his own plan now, he'll try to sit down with Republicans and negotiate something both sides can agree on. http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?ptitle=Energy%20News&s1=blk&tp=ad_topright_energy&refer=topfin&T=markets_bfgcgi_content99.ht&s2=blk&bt=ad_position1_energy&middle=ad_frame2_energy&s=AOxxZjBXlQmluZ2Ft 


PREPAID POWER PROPOSED - [Associated Press, June 5.] Operators of the region's electricity grid recommended yesterday that consumers pay extra to ensure that New England has enough electricity generation capacity.  Federal regulators had ordered the new charge in December -- even though New England now has plenty of generation capacity -- but a court challenge has kept it from being implemented. The rate would go into effect July 1, if approved by federal regulators.  The proposal requires companies that buy electricity from generators to pay those generators to maintain enough extra capacity to accommodate peak demand.  If the companies don't pay enough for extra capacity, they are forced to pay a ""deficiency charge."" http://www.telegram.com/news/page_one/10nelectric1.html 

ALARMED CALIFORNIANS CUT ELECTRIC POWER USE - [Washington Post, June 6.] Fearful of blackouts and expensive utility bills, Californians have begun conserving electricity at a rate the state has rarely seen.  New figures show that California residents and businesses reduced power consumption by 11 percent in May. http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/157/nation/Alarmed_Californians_cut_electric_power_use+.shtml 

CONSUMERS LAG ON ELECTRIC PRICE CURVE - [CBS MarketWatch, June 6.] Up to now, many California electricity users have been opening their monthly bills and muttering to themselves: ""What energy crisis?""  Of course there have been periodic blackouts for some, and many utility customers have seen their bills rise. But a sizable number of consumers have not seen a big change in their electric bills.   That's all about to change. And it's just in time, because wholesale electricity prices are coming down but state-approved energy increases are taking effect. http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?print=1&guid={AD628F25-0EB8-4EA4-A8FB-E1617477E3D0}&siteid=yhoo 


MEDIA QUOTE OF THE WEEK:  ""What's more beneficial, move forward on the larger agenda or trudge around through the mud on this? Why beat our heads against the wall on price caps when we'll never be any closer on it?  If we moved forward, it would look like a partisan bloodbath.""  - A GOP Aide, CNN, June 6, 2001 http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/06/06/congress.energy/index.html 

JUST 9 DAYS 'TIL FATHER'S DAY - THINK NEWPOWER - If you're planning on buying Dad a tie this Father's Day, you're still living in the '90's.  Instead, consider buying a gift that focuses on a more pressing, ""2001"" topic he will appreciate - energy efficiency and savings.
Saving on energy and energy efficiency have been a concern for most Dads, and ""shut off the lights, I'm not made of money"" has been roared by Dads nationwide. NewPower offers some Father's Day gift ideas that will light up his life:
The Power Planner allows the family to save energy when using even the most energy-hungry appliances. A plug that is simple to use (just plugs into a wall outlet), it can reduce the energy usage of some motorized appliances by up to 23 percent.   It's great for the refrigerator, window air conditioning unit or gas clothes dryer.  It's only $39.95, plus shipping and handling.  It will pay for itself.
MoleculAir? Filters slip into the home heating and cooling systems where they capture allergy-causing particles, dust, pollen, pet dander and dirt that contaminate the air and clog the heating and cooling systems, often causing them to expend more energy.  As an added service, Dad will get a bi-monthly reminder (by mail or e-mail) to change the filters.  The price of the filters runs from $39.95 to $59.95, plus shipping and handling.
The EnergyPack offers 300-watts of portable power.  Whether Dad is boating, camping, indoors or outoors, he has a rechargeable generator (think portable outlet) with him.  He can use it to jump-start his car or to recharge his cell phone.  It's small enough to carry with him, yet powerful enough to run his laptop for seven hours.  It is $159.95 plus shipping and handling (a more powerful, 600-watt EnergyPack is also available for $279.95).
It's not to late to order these items in time for Father's Day.  Call 1-866-NEWPOWER.  NewPower is the innovative energy source consumers can trust.

OF INTEREST * * * J.P. Morgan (JPM) has introduced a report launching its small-cap strategy (a small cap stock is defined by JPM as one with less than $3 billion in capitalization). The report provides small-cap stock picks, insights and data to leverage JPM analysts' views.  The first report (5/16/01) was titled ""The Inefficient Frontier"" because JPM believes that small caps are often poorly followed, leading to inefficiencies from which astute investors can profit.   The report's ""Trading Recommended List"" includes 25 stocks that JPM considers ""best-positioned companies"" poised for immediate appreciation, with a 12-month upside potential of at least 30 percent (turnover on the list occurs as warranted).  Among the 25 stocks on the list is NPW, The New Power Company, the only stock under the industry listing for ""Electric Companies."" 
Please note, news such as this is included in POWER BRIEFS to inform employees about the performance of and ""word on the Street"" about our stock.  NewPower does not endorse any one brokerage firm.

"NEWPOWER LAUNCHES ONLINE ENERGY SAVING CENTER","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


               NEWPOWER LAUNCHES ONLINE ENERGY SAVING CENTER

 Residential Consumers And Small Businesses Can Learn How to Reduce Energy

     Usage And Costs; Purchase Full Line Of Energy Efficient Products



PURCHASE, NY, October 29, 2001 ? The New Power Company, the first national

residential and small business energy provider, today announced that it has

launched the Energy Saving Center, a group of online tools to help

residential consumers and small commercial businesses reduce energy usage

and costs.  The Energy Saving Center can be found on www.newpower.com



Key elements of the NewPower Energy Saving Center are the Home and Business

Analyzers.  These on-line audit tools, which are free to all

www.newpower.com visitors, provide a top-to-bottom analysis of energy

usage, and offer specific recommendations on behavior modification and

products that can save energy.   The products can then be purchased through

the Energy Efficient Products On-line Store



The Home Analyzer allows residential consumers to learn how much money

people in homes similar to theirs spend on energy.  They can also uncover

specific energy saving opportunities in their own homes.   Using the

Business Analyzer, small businesses can choose to analyze one facility or

multiple sites.   The tool examines each aspect of a business' energy use

(including which appliances or systems use the most energy), and provides

customized analyses, recommendations, and a means to track their progress.



The NewPower Energy Saving Center is just one way that energy restructuring

is leading to technological innovation and efficiency.  Competition among

energy marketers ? like NewPower ? encourages cost savings and new and

better ways to consume electricity and natural gas.

"calif power letter","Ken,

I've sent your letter to the Governor and top legislators.

I'm also working with David Freeman in the governor's office as well to try
to keep sce out of bankruptcy.

It's unfortunate that government doesn't work more like business. There
seems to be no sense of urgency in finding the facts to make an intelligent
decision, just people who don't want to make any decision even to do that.

On a side note, Propel develops software that makes it much easier to
develop 24x7 mission critical systems including very advanced data
management. Is there someone who you'd recommend I can talk with on the
energy trading side of enron to explore the potential of our helping you
make your systems more reliable/scalable/easier to maintain?

Thanks!

"Hang in There","Ken,  
I realize these are tough days for you.  I want you to know that I am glad you are there and that you are the key to getting things back on track.  I am certain that you have seen tough times before (unlike much of your management) and that you will LEAD Enron through this period. 
From a bystander position (I left Enron in May), I encourage you to clearly bring all the issues to light immediately, take the lumps, and demonstrate to the community and the employees that necessary corrections will be made and made competently and forcibly.   
Times like these define leaders and I know you have the courage and experience to hang in there.  If there is anything I can do to assist, let me know.

"An Enron Employee's Perspective","Dear Mr. Lay,

It would be difficult for me to describe the excitement I experienced when I
first knew that I was soon to be an Enron employee over a year ago.  I came
into Enron in EES August 2000 as an Account Manager in the Costa Mesa
office.  I asked for the most challenging assignment available and was given
the opportunity to manage the relationship and contract execution between
EES and the majority of our marquis national customers (Owens-Corning,
Suiza, Quebecor, General Cable, Packaged Ice etc).  I really loved that
assignment and (according to the PRC) was excellent at what I did.

I (like many others at Enron) left a very lucrative job to join EES and I
have turned away several opportunities since joining the company.  I had
envisioned being a part of something as exciting and innovative as Enron as
more rewarding than following more lucrative job offers.  Now, I find myself
in a position that I would have never dreamed of:
*		I'm uncertain about my job security
*		Like so many others, I've lost significant personal wealth
*		I'm not proud or excited to tell others that I work for
Enron
*		I fight with my instinct to leave hoping that I can be a
part of something good coming from all of this.

I don't understand how this could have happened.  So many decent, hard
working, loyal, honest people are being devastated by the results of
questionable management, a lack of leadership and the appearance of abject
greed among Enron Sr. executives.  This is a truly sad state of affairs that
will be the subject of so many ""B"" school projects most of which will focus
on our mistakes.

So, what can a guy so far down the food chain do these days to help right
the ship?  I am here, I do not want to abandon ship and I am ready willing
and able to make a difference.  Mr. Lay, there are some brilliant employees
buried below layers of management that have proven little more than
incompetence.  Consider finding time to visit the troops in the field and
solicit input.  I believe you can find more hope for resurrection out here
than behind the filters that exist between you and your real employees.

My prayers are with you,

"UH Library-Honors Campaign","Ken,

I was pleased to have an opportunity to meet with you and Linda in April to
discuss the Library/Honors campaign.  To date, over $12.3 million has been
raised and we have several proposals outstanding.  I'm writing to ask your
help with Jack Trotter, a trustee of the Vivian L. Smith Foundation.

Earlier this year you indicated that you would be willing to sign a letter
to Mr. Trotter on behalf of the Library/Honors building project.  Enclosed
is a draft of the letter.  A proposal for $250,000 was submitted to the
Foundation in May, the trustees are scheduled to meet on June 15.  Mr.
Trotter is a trustee with both the M.D. Anderson Foundation (which has
already committed $1 mil to the library/honors project) and the Vivian L.
Smith Foundation.  The Smith Foundation provided a grant of $500k to the
KUHT/KUHF Melcher building that opened last fall.

Please let me know if you have any question regarding the enclosed letter.
Also, please fax or e-mail the final letter to me at the address below.

Thank you very much.
