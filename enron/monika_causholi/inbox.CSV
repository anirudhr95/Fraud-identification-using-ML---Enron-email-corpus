Subject:	October 23rd and 24th Market Pulp Team Meeting

As many of you already know, we have scheduled an offsite market pulp planning meeting for October 23rd and 24th.  We intend on addressing a range of strategic objectives as well as cover specific customer related issues.  The meeting will be held at the Doubletree Hotel in the Austin Room.  We will begin promptly at 8:00 am on 10/23 and 10/24.  Lunchs will be provided   Please make sure your calender is clear for both days.

October 23rd will focus on a technical issues relating to pulp fiber characteristic, product end uses and marketing strategies for a range of N. American grades.  We are bringing in an outside consultant to run this session (agenda to follow).

October 24th will focus on business strategy issues (see attached 10/24 agenda).  I have taken the liberty of volunteering some of you to run specific portions of the session.  We will need to manage our time carefully if we are to successfully complete the agenda.    

It is also important that you develop an acocunt plan for each of the accounts you are responsible for prior to 10/23 (account assignments attached, ENE Universe).  I have already asked each of the pulp originators to get with the appropriate pulp cash trader to develop these plans.  Each plan should be concise enough to fit on one page, and contain three sections - key account goals, financial and physical products targeted to achieve account goals and an activity plan.  You will be expected to present each during the meeting.  

Jim

In response to your request, attached you will find the international trade
data you purchased on October 25th, 2001 (order number 116832). I included
the data for all the available years. If there is no data for a year, for a
specific code, it's that there was no data reported. The reason why you did
not obtain the data for the years before 2001 is probably because you did
not highlight the years you wished. In fact, for each of the variables, you
have to highlight the ones you wish to obtain, even if you selected the
""individually"" box. 
 
If you have questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for
your interest in Statistics Canada.

Could someone explain what happened to 1993-2000 export figures?

"Associate / Analyst Program","
After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

<DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P><BR>Hello,</P></DIV>&gt;
<P>I am interested for the master's degree at Bocconi and I have a few questions regarding the application below:</P>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P>1) Can I pay the application fee in US dollars? I don't know if I can write a check in Euros. If&nbsp;yes, how much would it cost in US dollars?</P>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P>2) I downloaded the application packet from the internet but I can't find the CHECK CARD that is required for the application. Where can I find it?</P>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P>3) It says in the instructions that&nbsp;the envelopes provided should be used for the letters of recommendations and transcrips. But since I downloaded the application I don't have the provided e chosen just&nbsp;the MBA?</P>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P>5) Can I do all application process online including recommendations, transcrips?</P>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P>6) One of the questions in the application asks for the graduate degree, does this mean undergraduate degree? The reason I ask is that I haven't seen any question asking for undergraduate, only fo dollars instead?</P>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P>Thanks for your help,</P>

"Fiber Morphology-Original Spreadsheet","monika and dave,

as mentioned during our phone conversation, i am enclosing the original
spread sheet that was developed to capture both the morphological aspects of
various fibers as well the pulp qualities for different wood species.
 
also, the spreadsheet that dan T has provided with by enron, under fiber
morphology , and under hardwood broadleaf  species, southern mixed hardwood
(Hi Oak and Low Oak) and mixed tropical hardwoods are listed.
 
for this category only pulp characteristics can be provided but not fiber
morphology. so, please check that too.

if you have questions, please call me ((864) 676-5636) or dan T.

thanks.

"RE: Advice","Hi Monika -

I have contacted the Head of the Finance Division at the University of
Colorado in Boulder to see if they offer assistantships. He is my major
professor from years ago. I will get back to you as soon as I hear from
him.

I am also forwarding to you in another email some info regarding
potential employment at Tektronix. Even though they will be coming to
OSU and you are in Texas, I would recommend that you forward your resume
to them and tell them you got the information from me. Tell them to call
me if they want to know more about you.

Subject: Advice


Hello Jim,

I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon.
That's great news!

Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I
would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial
security. My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was
bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer
scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those. 

It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the
right direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to
have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through
with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is
what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in
Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have
great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well
recognized for its talent pool.

If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I
really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have
no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any
contact in the job market I would look into that too. 

Thanks Jim,
Monika

"Presentation Database","Dear Team,

The Fundamental Analysis Team is developing a presentation database that will:

Creating a centralized repository of presentations that are current for each commodity group
Better document management - multiple users can simultaneously view and select various slides.  This will increase speed of presentation development since users can email their 
        selected information to the development team.
Add to Cart feature - allow employees to select the slides they need from various presentations and email it to their inboxes. 
Provide standardized formats and up-to-date information

We are in the process of developing a program that will encompass the benefits above.  In the meantime, a temporary database has been created in the 
o:/Industrial Markets/Fundamentals/Presentation Database.  The database is divided in to commodity groups and specific topics.

Please forward me any presentations that you are currently using and I will add them to this database.  If you have any questions, please call me.

Please find attached Competitive Intelligence's current assessment of recent events in several emerging markets, particularly Argentina.  As the situation there appears to be getting more dire, we will continue monitoring the potential ramifications for other emerging markets such as Brazil.  Please note that this information is highly proprietary and should not be shared outside Enron Industrial Markets.  Additionally, if you have any further questions, please feel free to forward them to me as Brendan Fitzsimmons supports a very broad audience and may not be able to field the request.  Thanks.

Hello Karen:

I have returned to Houston after a trip to the East Coast: In Washington and New York I had the opportunity to further discuss and update the issue of Argentina, and Latin America more broadly, with sources in both the financial and economic communities.  

Here is an overall update with some specifics highlighted:

As we had reported in July and August and as we discussed lat month, the basic thesis still holds, at Treasury and the IFIs and in the emerging market financial community: i.e.
 
Differentiation in DC and NY: Argentina is on its own and Brazil will be given support, as will Turkey and Indonesia.  Policy since 9/11 relative to Pakistan has been indicative of the evolving Washington calculus; experience of sustained weakness and unexpected shock of 9/11 has revealed that contagion is a secondary driver right now
Differentiation between BA and Sao Paulo: Decoupling of Brazilian Real and C-Bond from Argy Peso NDFs and FRB in currency and bond markets continues to strengthen the base policy bias of quarantine/reinforce relative to BA and SP, as has relative flight to quality in the EM asset class that has been seen over the last few weeks, most notably in case of Mexico  
Another waiting game vis-?-vis Argy: Despite the 'effective default' conditions in Argy and a new spate of downgrades, the once again much rumored swap/restructure is by no means a settled issue, and even if/once achieved still leaves open the underlying problem of the peso-$ peg, w/ a dollarization above parity scenario still lurking.  As with the saga all year, this is primarily a political drama being conveyed through economic channels
Oil in the policy mix: Collapse and continuing pressure in oil market will expose and exacerbate underlying fault-lines both within OPEC and between OPEC and non-OPEC producers: apart from obviously more visible Russian role, this will continue build in a focus on regional players inside and outside the cartel: Venezuela (including internal Chavez dynamic, Venezuela within OPEC, and price v. market share debate) and Mexico, incl. relative to Western Hemisphere supply security.  The end of the Congressional year in DC, war politics, and the upcoming OPEC meeting next week will continue to contribute near term volatility
Domestic US politics: Current breakdown of post-9/11 bipartisan consensus now in full throat as appropriations and special needs bills are facing problems in committees, on the floors of both chambers and/or in the face of a conferencing.  Of particular importance at this time is the Senate Finance Committee's consideration of a stimulus bill.  The lack of progress, despite an attempt late last week by the White House to bring more executive pressure to bear, has led to concern that a final stimulus bill may not be ready until just before Christmas, and there remains a danger that no stimulus bill will go through.  A new wrinkle in this drama is the effort by Alaskan Sens. Stevens and Murkowski to potentially attach an energy bill, including ANWR drilling, to any Senate stimulus bill, focusing on national security interests in order to sway moderates.  Given that the markets have already priced in a stimulus bill by around thanksgiving and on the order of $100B, there is downside risk in delay or defeat.  These dangers have been heightened further over the past week as weak data has come in even weaker than expected, putting a further premium on a sooner, more dramatic recovery

Let me know if this is helpful and if there are any macroecon or political specifics that you are particularly concerned about. 


Regards,
Brendan

"Forestweb's prices on Bloomberg Professional Service","Forestweb's prices to be listed on Bloomberg Professional Service

LOS ANGELES, Nov 27, 2001 - Forestweb Inc. will be providing  its 
pricing for market pulp, publication grade papers, stumpage, and logs

Forestweb's pulp prices are reported by Diane Keaton. Ms. Keaton has 
been covering market pulp for the past seven years and for the past 
22 months as an editor and reporter with Forestweb. Ms. Keaton has 
been described by a pulp executive as ""arguably the most

(SC-A), 40-lb coated #5, and 60-lb coated #3. Uncoated free-sheet 
grades include 50-lb offset rolls and 20-lb cut size (copy paper).

Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to

     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is

the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"Eucalyptus Pulp - Final Note","
Martin,

Subsequent to my last e-mail I discovered an additional detail which may possibly clarify why ENCE prefers to purchase the Chilean E. globulus species to the Brazilian species for pulp production.  It would appear that the E. globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during the refining process.  While most papermakers generally don't refine hardwoods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingly do use a single refiner for all grades.  This is particularly true of the Italian mills.  Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining required for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opacity, etc.), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suited for this type of processing.  Accordingly, the globulus species (which is also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much better under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus.

In any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have.  Thanks.

Karen

Subject:	JP Morgan Conference Call on Enron

JPM Morgan (JPM) held a conference call on 30 October on the recent events surrounding Enron. Below, the main points are summarised.

The overall tone was positive for three reasons: The two analysts (one equity and fixed income) made a very good effort to clarify the current situation; They gave a positive view on Enron in general; And, they capped the value of the potential off-balance sheet liabilities.

In their view, there are no issues with the core business.

The fundamental issue is short-term liquidity. To alleviate this issue, they would like to see extra credit lines of about USD 1.5-2bn, and the extension of a revolver maturing in May 2002;

They think that the liability from Osprey and Marlin is likely to be in the region of USD 400-500m. This assumes that there are no other contingent liabilities form other off-balance sheet commitments;

To resolve the situation surrounding this issue and to potentially avoid a downgrade, Enron must primarily restore confidence and improve disclosure of information surrounding the off-balance sheet liabilities.

One of the first things pointed out by the equity analyst was that he considered little permanent damage on the equity side, and importantly that there were no major with Enron's core business. But in their view, the fundamental issue was related to credit markets, short term liquidity in particular. To alleviate this issue, the analyst would like to see the following:

That Enron secures an extra USD 1-2bn in credit lines, preferably USD 1.5-2bn;

That the maturity of the USD 2.25bn revolver maturing in May 2002 is extended.

From the commodity side, they were confident that there no immediate liquidity issues. They had been in touch with trading counterparties like Dynegy, El Paso, Williams... and had not sensed that any of them would radically reduce their trading with Enron. (However, they noted that a weakening in trading activities could mean smaller market shares, which could negatively affect earnings.)

On the debt side, one overall concern was the actual amount of debt, which they estimated to about USD 17.5bn, and related potential debt servicing problems. This includes debt actually held by Enron (about USD 12bn), debt attributable to Enron through unconsolidated equity affiliates, and the Marlin, Osprey and Yosemite debt.

Much focus was on the Marlin and Osprey potential equity liabilities, as the analysts had no information indicating that any liability could arise from the equity affiliates or Yosemite. From Marlin and Osprey, Enron's worst case liability would be about USD 3.4bn (implying zero asset value), but they estimated that a likely outcome would be a liability of about USD 400-500m. (This liability only concerns Marlin and Osprey, and thus assumes that there no liabilities related to the equity affiliates and Yosemite.) It was noted that this liability did not necessarily have to be settled through a share issue, but could be settled through cash raised in asset sales.

The issue of getting downgraded below investment grade was discussed. The analysts did not seem to think that this was a likely outcome, but that a downgrade to BBB-/Baa3 was a possibility. They considered that if Enron wants to avoid a downgrade, the following measures should be implemented:

Restore confidence in Enron. In particular, improve disclosure, give a better background to the LJM partnership and specify the nature and the value of the assets held in the trusts;

Develop a cash flow plan to show how assets are to be monetised to pay down debt;

Streamline operations;

Provide information about the USD 600m broadband investments.

Finally, mark-to-market accounting was discussed as well. The analysts had no issue with that noting that for Enron's type of business this was an appropriate way to account for revenues. They considered the average daily VaR number of USD 60m to be low, thus not showing any evidence of aggressive accounting. Also, the retention of key staff would become very important in the future.

Regards

Tomas

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"FW: FOEX for 11/06","
Monika,

Good that you put some analysis with the price changes.  I'd be a bit careful about declaring that prices are expected to continue increasing through November --- many market observers (particularly Mr. Ross Hay-Roe) believe there's a good chance that the US$15/metric ton increase the producers already received will begin to erode in the next few weeks.  I think it's important that we give air time to all the possibilities, especially in light of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the market.  Thanks.

Karen

Subject:	FOEX for 11/06

Hello,
 
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week. 

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. 

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.   


Thanks,
Monika Causholli

"Norske Downtime for 1Q02","NorskeCanada announced today plans for additional curtailment for the first quarter of 2002 at its B.C. paper operations, as weak economic conditions have reduced demand for the company's products.  Norske is planning to shutdown 2 paper machines until market conditions improve. No. 3 paper machine at Port Alberni and No. 1 paper machine at Elk Falls are currently scheduled for shutdown in the 1Q02. A third paper machine, No. 1 at Crofton, is also planned for shutdown during the month of January.  This translates into about 34,000 MT for 1Q02 at Elk Falls (since Port Alberni produces mostly directory) and about 12,000 MT at the Crofton mill for January.  Given the uncertain economic climate, the company will review curtailment plans monthly so it can be quick to respond to any upturn in market conditions. Please find the Downtime database for 2002 attached below.

Subject:	Norscan Statistics for October 2001

Hello,

Please the attached PRELIMINARY CHEMICAL MARKET PULP REPORT from PPPC.

Highlights:

Inventories decreased by 48,000 metric tonnes, from the 1.549 million level, to reach the 1.501 million level. This is a positive development for pulp producers especially when compared to the hitorically flat change in October.

BUT in October the the lowering of inventories did not come as a result of producer discipline. In fact Norscan producers operated at 90% in October compared to the 79% in September.

What brought the reduction in inventories is the increase in shipments this month. Shipments were 1.866 million compared to the 1.771 million level in September. Demand was at a record high for the month of October due to strong pick-up sales in North America and Western Europe. Also contributing to the high demand were the shipments to Asia/Africa.
See the table below for the summary of statistics:

"Re: Tissue","Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study ""Outlook for World Tissue 
Business"" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.


Best regards

"newsprint update, 11/27","Dear Team,

Advance Publications' The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., is struggling to find $10 million to slash from its budget because many of its key retail advertisers have filed for bankruptcy or cut their spending.  The Star-Ledger still promises to honor its famous handbook pledge not to lay off any of its nonunion employees due to a bad turn in the economy.  The Star-Ledger also canceled its Christmas party, has closed a small satellite office in Newark, is offering buyouts to selected employees, and will decrease the amounts of its annual raises and bonuses.  The Star-Ledger has a  410,547-weekday-circulation newspaper and about 132,449 MT in newsprint consumption.  The carnage continues as the loss of advertising dollars plagues newspapers.

I am looking to see if anyone has done a comparison between RISI price forecasts for any commodity versus RISI actual price.  Dave had mentioned that maybe someone had already done this.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.

"fiber morphology study","Monika, I found the Jacobs-Sirrine proposal on the fiber study; you can get a copy from me.

They included a matrix on which they would display various fiber characteristics, which I'm attaching.  Cecil and I went over it and he suggested some changed, which are incorporated here. The only one he wants to add that isn't reflected here---but which we need to tell them---is that we want to know why each quality parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) application.

Let's go over this Monday morning.

Nov. 13, 2001 (Recycling Today) -- Weyerhaeuser?s recycling facility in Itasca, Indiana, was hit by fire Nov. 13.
                  Brian McDermott, a spokesman for Weyerhaeuser, said about 50 tons of old
                  corrugated container, roughly one day's worth of processing. While most of
                  the recovered paper being stored at the plant was lost, the structure itself
                  sustained limited damage. The only damage done to the equipment was a

Jim, Chandra, Jon, and Bob:

Tektronix is looking to interview some of our ""top"" finance students.
Please read the note below and see if you have a senior or MBA student
that you think should forward their resume to Tektronix. David will be
here on campus next Wednesday and if we can have a couple students send
their resume up electronic by Monday he said he can look them over and
get back to the students. I will be out tomorrow morning so if you have
a great student have them send their resume. Otherwise send me the name
and I can try and contact the student. Ray

Raymond:  Thanks again for helping us out.  If you are able to find some
seniors who are interested, we are planning to on-campus in Bexel 202
interviewing some accounting students on Wednesday of next week.  If you
had some resumes, they could be forwarded to my admin, Lisa Logsdon
(lisa.logsdon@tek.com).  It would be best for us if we could receive
resumes by Monday, then we would plan to turn those around quickly and
get word back to those students who we would like to meet with on
Wednesday.

Thanks again for helping us out with our recruiting efforts.  Going
directly through the faculty members who know the students has proven in
the past to be the most efficient and effective manner for us to move
forward.  It
really helps us out.   I can be reached at 503.627.4608 for any
questions or
clarification.

TORONTO, Nov. 26, 2001(Business Wire/press release) -- Hollinger Canadian
Newspapers, L.P. (TSE:HCN.UN.) announces net income including special
items for the quarter ending September 30, 2001 of $51,415,000 or
$0.28 per unit compared to $22,567,000 or $0.14 per unit for the
quarter ended September 30, 2000. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nine months ended September 30, 2001 the net income was
$167,603,000 or $0.92 per unit compared to $75,550,000 or $0.47 per
unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income before special items and income taxes in both the third
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 was significantly
lower than in 2000, primarily as a result of the disposition of
properties to CanWest Global Communications Corp. (""CanWest"") in
November 2000, the sale of UniMedia Company in January 2001, the sale
of the majority of the Ontario properties in July 2001 as well as
lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining operations,
offset in part, by lower interest expense as a result of the
conversion of the acquisition notes to units in November of 2000 and
interest income primarily related to the CanWest debentures received
in November of 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first nine months of 2001 special items totalled
$117,777,000 and included gains arising mainly from the sale of
UniMedia Company in January 2001 and the sale of the majority of the
remaining Ontario community newspapers in July 2001. In the first nine
months of 2000, special items totalled a loss of $1,672,000 and
principally represented severance charges. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same Store Analysis<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a same store basis, including only those newspapers which were
owned for the nine-month period in each year, total revenue was
$77,421,000 in 2001 compared to $81,982,000 in 2000, a decrease of
$4,561,000 or 5.6%. EBITDA for 2001 was $8,581,000 compared to
$10,756,000 for 2000, a decrease of $2,175,000 or 20.2%.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment and Other Income<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the nine months ending September 30, 2001, investment and
other income includes a cash dividend of $1,225,000 on 8,164,000
CanWest non-voting shares, interest on cash balances of approximately
$3,300,000, interest income of $23,958,000 accrued on the subordinated
debentures the Partnership received as partial consideration from the
sale of newspapers to CanWest in November 2000 and other interest
income of $2,272,000. This debenture interest is payable at the option
of CanWest either in cash, by the issue of additional debentures or by
the issue of CanWest shares. The total principal amount of debentures
(as adjusted, if required) is due on November 15, 2010. The principal
amount of these debentures was $239,861,000 as at December 31, 2000.
On February 28, 2001 and July 31, 2001, a CanWest subsidiary issued
additional debentures with a total principal amount of $20,983,000 to
the Partnership. These debentures represent the arrears interest owing
from November 16, 2000 to July 31, 2001 calculated at 12.125% per
annum, of which $17,473,000 relates to the current year. As a result,
the principal amount of all CanWest debentures held at September 30,
2001 is $260,844,000.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial Condition and Liquidity<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working capital consists of current assets less current
liabilities. At September 30, 2001, working capital was $28,398,000
compared to $43,473,000 at December 31, 2000. The $15,075,000
reduction in working capital results from lower cash balances on hand
at September 30, 2001 primarily due to cash distributions in excess of
cash inflows during the period.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term debt, including the current portion was $100,000 at
September 30, 2001 compared with $1,237,000 at December 31, 2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows provided by operating activities were $22,783,000 in
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 compared with cash flows
provided by operating activities of $98,981,000 in 2000. The reduction
in cash flows provided by operating activities compared to 2000
results primarily from the sales of the Unimedia and Ontario newspaper
properties and lower operating results at the Partnership's remaining
operations.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows used in financing activities were $375,062,000 for the
nine months ended September 2001 as compared to $107,953,000 for 2000.
The cash flows used in financing activities included cash
distributions of $374,968,000 in 2001 as compared to $107,424,000 in
2000.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash flows provided by investing activities were $340,143,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 as compared to cash flow used
in investing activities of $7,963,000 in 2000. The increase in cash
flows provided by investing activities results primarily from the
proceeds on sale of the Unimedia and Ontario papers in January and
July of 2001. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year, the Partnership has paid two special
distributions of $0.70 in March of 2001 and $1.18 in August of 2001
using the proceeds from the sale of properties during the year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2001, the Partnership, Hollinger International Inc.
and Hollinger Inc. announced that the Partnership had constituted a
committee of independent directors to explore with Hollinger the
possibility of an offer to purchase the units of the Partnership not
held by Hollinger, being approximately 24 million units. The structure
and terms of any such offer (including the form of consideration to be
offered) have not been proposed and there can be no assurance that any
offer will be made.<BR>

Subject:	FOEX for 11/06

Hello,
 << File: Foex Prices.xls >> 
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week. 

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. 

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.   


Thanks,
Monika Causholli

relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"Dynegy article","
Dynegy Is Mulling $2 Billion Investment
In Enron in Possible Step Toward Merger
By ROBIN SIDEL 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Dynegy Inc. is in advanced discussions to infuse about $2 billion into Enron Corp. in a transaction that may lead to a full-blown merger between the two companies, people familiar with the matter said.
A formal transaction could be unveiled as early as Thursday, these people said. The situation is very fluid and is subject to change, these people noted.
Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral.
Enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected. Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up.

"RE: Tissue","Dear Ms. Causholli,

TAD equals to through-air-drying, a process where hot air is blown in a drum 
through the paper web and drying it. It allows a higher bulk of tissue paper as 
the paper web is not pressed hard against iron as in the case of conventional 
drying. Higher bulk means softer paper and better absorbency properties, 
therefore it is prefeered by companies aiming at very high tissue quality. I am 
not a technical expert but machinery manufacturers, especially Metso Paper's 
Honeycomb division in the USA could explain TAD in more technical terms.

AfH stands for away-from-home, i.e. uses in offices, industry, hotels, 
restaurants, hospitals etc. outside households.

I have not yet updated all the 2000 numbers but will do it within the 
next couple of months. Some data is very difficult to obtain, and thus updating 
takes a lot of time.


Best regards

"RE: Information from University of Colorado","Hi -
 
I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have
some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to
do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific
recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me
know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically,
students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it
directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential
letters.

	I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD program and I am
waiting for his response.
	In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know
you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am
planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the
paperwork to you on Monday.
	Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU
trying to see what they can help me with?
	Thanks for all your help. I will keep you posted.

		Here is what I heard from my former professor. If I were

is worth a try.

		Hi Jim,
		It has been a long time between communications.  We no
longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus
does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program
each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program
coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at
Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific
recommendations.

		PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic
life and probably won't be retiring for another few years.

			Hi Ron - 

			It certainly has been a long time since we have
communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either
have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate
future as this job is so much fun.

			The reason I am writing is that a former student
of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time
that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in
Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of
scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago
and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening
at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a
graduate degree.

			Our College of Business does not have any
graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree
in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest
students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works
very hard. 

			Does CU still offer the masters degree in
finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George
Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under
Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name
and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you
put her in touch with the right person at CU?

			If CU does not have anything available do you
know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to
Monika?

			Thanks for any help you can provide. 

			Best regards, 

			Jim

"RE: Pulp and printing & writing presentation - Facts & Figures","Monika:

Thanks for your excellent analysis on the pulp market.  One question I had was why Metsa-Botnia (2.5 million tons NBSK per year) was not included?  Metsa-Botnia is a joint venture between M-Real (formerly Metsa Serla) and UPM-Kymmene.  Have these volumes been included under UPM and M-Real?

Let me know when you get a chance.  thanks

Regards,

Jonathan

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Dave,

I am leaving for Dallas tonight because I arranged a meeting with an international advisor at University of Texas tomorrow. She will do an exception for me.
Anyways, I won't be coming to work tomorrow but I will keep in touch.

See you on Wednesday

Dave,

Just got off the phone with the school. Apparently I don't have enough time to submit application but I practically begged for it so they are allowing me to submit a late application.

The only thing is that I won't have an answer until the beginning of January. Classes start in the middle of January. So, is it possible to change the date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me. It would be great.

Thanks,
Monika

	Jim,
	 
	I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare
the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the
recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and
maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as
envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would
have to be signed across the seal.
	There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
	   1- Yale
	   2- Boston College
	   3- University of Massachusetts
	   4- Bocconi University (Italy)
	 
	Thanks,
	Monika

		Hi -
		 
		I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows,
they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I
would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a
specific recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So
let me know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically,
students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it
directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential
letters.

			I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD
program and I am waiting for his response.
			In the meantime can you write me a
recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would
it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now.
I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.
			Also, should I contact the other finance
professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with?
			Thanks for all your help. I will keep you

				Hi Again Monika -
				 
				Here is what I heard from my former
professor. If I were you, I would contact Eric Hughson about CU's PhD
program in Finance. It is worth a try.
				 
				I will contact you if I hear about other
opportunities either for graduate study or employment opportunities.
Keep me posted.

				Hi Jim,
				It has been a long time between
communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe
the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the
Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance
PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at
Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific
recommendations.
				Ron
				PS--I also still like the teaching part
of the academic life and probably won't be retiring for another few
years.

				Hi Ron - 

				It certainly has been a long time since
we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and
either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the
immediate future as this job is so much fun.

				The reason I am writing is that a former
student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for
some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's
Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some
sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or
so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is
happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back
for a graduate degree.

				Our College of Business does not have
any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master
degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest
students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works
very hard. 

				Does CU still offer the masters degree
in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George
Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under
Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name
and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you
put her in touch with the right person at CU?

				If CU does not have anything available
do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the
information on to Monika?

				Thanks for any help you can provide. 

				Best regards, 

				Jim

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Subject: PhD in Finance


Hello Mr. Hughson,

Ronald Melicher adviced me to contact you about the PhD program. 
I am interested in the field of finance and I wanted to learn about the
PhD finance program at the University of Colorado. 
Can you summarize the main points of the program, its requirements,and
the deadlines? 

Two years of coursework, economics, econometrics, and finance seminars are what most people normally take.  Math skills are important initially.  Later on, it depends what you do.  Then you take comps and write a thesis.  I think that the deadlines and such are on our website.  The program starts in the fall, and you are advised to start then.  As far as admissions requirements, take the GMAT or GRE, and do well.  We have many applicants with >700 on the GMAT, for instance.



I have finished a finance degree from Oregon State University and have
two years of work experience.

Work experience is not much help, unless it specifically relates to what you are working on.  Abstraction is an important skill, and at best, work experience can help you with getting rid of extraneous detail.

Sincerely,
Monika Causholli
Enron Corp.

Hello Mr. Temple,

This is a follow-up email to what you talked with Dave Allan on the
subject of Fiber morphology. Attached you will find the fiber
characteristics spreadsheet - the most updated version. 

We also have an additional question which is - why each quality
parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use
(paper grade) application.

You can contact me for any further questions.

"Indonesia Pulp Capacity","
The attached spreadsheet contains a preliminary analysis of projected capacity growth for Indonesia through the year 2005.  While I feel reasonably comfortable with the numbers and the timing of projects coming online, some additional work will be required to gain 100% confidence in this information.  This should be completed within the next two weeks.  

In addition, as the trend of replacing mixed tropical hardwood with higher quality plantation acacia is already underway, I will make an attempt to identify the timber resources of the largest market pulp producers and when they anticipate initiating production of acacia pulp.  Given the scope of this project, it may require several weeks to complete.

Finally, I'm considering implementing a monitoring system similiar to the one already covering the Brazilian producers so we can accurately track activity by the Indonesian producers.  The information I've seen from PPPC, and particularly RISI, does not appear to be very accurate.  However, if anyone has an alternative source for shipments, production, inventory, etc. data, I'm open to suggestions.

In any case, I hope this assists in shedding some light on an otherwise difficult region, and, as always, I welcome your feedback.  Thanks.

Karen

Subject:	newsprint mill conversion

Hello Team,

Tembec Inc. may back a controversial $450-million project to convert the mothballed Chandler newsprint mill in Quebec to make high-quality magazine paper.  The Chandler mill was shut in 1999 by the former owner, Abitibi, due to high costs.   The Quebec government and the union-backed Quebec Solidarity Fund now effectively own Chandler and are negotiating with Tembec to tie up the conversion project by year-end.       A comfort to newsprint producers as potential newsprint capacity is diverted else where at a time when the market is sitting in a supply glut.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Dave,

Just got off the phone with the school. Apparently I don't have enough time to submit application but I practically begged for it so they are allowing me to submit a late application.

The only thing is that I won't have an answer until the beginning of January. Classes start in the middle of January. So, is it possible to change the date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me. It would be great.

Thanks,

			Jim,
			 
			I was thinking that since I do not have enough
time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me
to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to
expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms
as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The
envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
			There will be a total of four schools that I am
applying to.
			   1- Yale
			   2- Boston College
			   3- University of Massachusetts
			   4- Bocconi University (Italy)

				Hi -
				 
				I would contact the other finance guys
here. Who knows, they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is
concerned, I would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad
school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to
fill out. So let me know after you get the required info from the
schools. Typically, students just send it to me as I will probably have
to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want
confidential letters.

				Hi Jim,
				It has been a long time between
communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe
the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the
Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance
PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at
Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific
recommendations.

				Hi Ron - 

				It certainly has been a long time since
we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and
either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the
immediate future as this job is so much fun.

				The reason I am writing is that a former
student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for
some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's
Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some
sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or
so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is
happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back
for a graduate degree.

				Our College of Business does not have
any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master
degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest
students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works
very hard. 

				Does CU still offer the masters degree
in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George
Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under
Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name
and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you
put her in touch with the right person at CU?

				If CU does not have anything available
do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the
information on to Monika?

				Thanks for any help you can provide. 

				Best regards, 

				Jim

"FW:  Reel Time - November Supplemental Report"," 

	REEL TIME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT
November 14, 2001 

  <http://www.reeltimenewsletter.com/images/hori525.jpg>

	
	Retail Review:  October Retail Sales Up 7.1% To A New 8 -Year Low

The strength of retail sales impacts advertising expenditures and thus paper consumption. This supplemental report will review several items related to retail sales and advertising spending so the title is only partially descriptive - but I couldn't pass up the opportunity

The title story first. The October increase in national retail sales of 7.1% over September should be accompanied by a chorus of ""Happy Days are Here Again"" - but let's take a closer look. Auto sales were up 26.4% in October due to a 0% interest promotional program, which was obviously a great success, but is unrepeatable. Excluding auto sales, national retail sales were up only 1% over depressed September sales.

When comparing October of 2001 to October of 2000, retail sales, excluding autos, were up only 1.6%, which according to The Dismal Scientist, is the slowest year-over-year growth in at least 8 years. Furniture, home furnishings, and electronic retailers all had lower sales than in October 2000, while apparel sales were flat. Early anecdotal reports in November seem to point to modest improvement over October. There will be a Christmas season but it won't be robust and it's too early to break out into song.

Ad Pages and Survivorship Bias

The Magazine Publishers Association reported that year-to-date ad pages through August were down 11.2%. However, September ad pages were down 9.9% and that brought the year-to-date decline to 9.2%! How can ad pages be reduced from a negative 11.2% year-to-date to a negative 9.2% year-to-date by the inclusion of a one-month decline of 9.9%? It's not easy.

""Survivorship Bias"" can be the manipulation of a reality TV show or, in this case, provide the answer to our ad page dilemma. MPA ad pages are calculated each month by comparing the year-over-year change of a specific list of magazines. New magazines are only added at the beginning of each year. However, when magazines cease publication during the year, both last year's ad pages and this year's ad pages are eliminated. Since magazines which cease publication during the year will almost always have ad page declines greater than average before closure (and a 100% decline after closure), the elimination of these magazines from the survey creates a positive bias - a survivorship bias. Only surviving magazines are considered.

It was the closure of The Industry Standard in August that was largely responsible for the ad page anomaly between the August and September year-to-date data. Ad pages in The Industry Standard were down 76% through August, but since there was no September publication, this magazine was no longer included in the survey and this huge drop in ad pages was no longer represented in the data.

This year has been an especially difficult year for magazine publishers. Through August, more than 60 titles were eliminated, and many were not new publications. Nineteen had been in business prior to 1990 and five had start-ups between 1928 and 1959. Mademoiselle ends a 66-year run in November.

Since all these closures will be purged from ad page data, the real ad page decline is significantly greater than that being reported.

October Ad Pages

Monthly reports of year-over-year ad page declines had bottomed in May and, while still negative, had improved for three consecutive months. Absent the events of September 11, October ad pages would have likely declined between 4 and 8%. October was, however, the first month of ad pages to be impacted by September 11 and was down 16.8% from October 2000.

Catalog Sales

Catalog Age tracks 17 publicly traded consumer catalogers and indicated that 8 out of 17 of these companies had reported a net loss in the second quarter.

September 11 events, the anthrax situation, and another postage increase sometime in the next 9 months are exacerbating what was already a very difficult economic environment for catalogs.

When Will The Economy Bottom?

Most economists are expecting a short, mild recession, which will bottom in Q1/02. We won't argue the point very hard but still expect the bottom a little later, hopefully by Q2/02. Since retail is about 2/3's of our economy, any turnaround will have to be accompanied by an improvement in retail sales. Until this turnaround takes place, print advertising and print consumption will remain under pressure.

Here is what I heard from my former professor. If I were you, I would
contact Eric Hughson about CU's PhD program in Finance. It is worth a
try.
 
I will contact you if I hear about other opportunities either for
graduate study or employment opportunities. Keep me posted.

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an
MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit
only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus
it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric
Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU.
Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.

PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic life and
probably won't be retiring for another few years.

	Hi Ron - 

	It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I
am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I.
Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as
this job is so much fun.

	The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from
Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she
would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or
PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship
or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been
working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am
not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

	Our College of Business does not have any graduate student
assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or
PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had
in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

	Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still
offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on
a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was
going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and
perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the
right person at CU?

	If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few
schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

	Thanks for any help you can provide. 

	Best regards,

			Jim,
			 
			I was thinking that since I do not have enough
time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me
to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to
expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms
as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The
envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
			There will be a total of four schools that I am
applying to.
			   1- Yale
			   2- Boston College
			   3- University of Massachusetts
			   4- Bocconi University (Italy)
			 
			Thanks,
			Monika

				Hi -
				 
				I would contact the other finance guys
here. Who knows, they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is
concerned, I would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad
school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to
fill out. So let me know after you get the required info from the
schools. Typically, students just send it to me as I will probably have
to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want
confidential letters.

				In the meantime can you write me a

I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.

				Hi Jim,
				It has been a long time between
communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe
the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the
Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance
PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at
Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific
recommendations.

of the academic life and probably won't be retiring for another few

				Hi Ron - 

				It certainly has been a long time since
we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and
either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the
immediate future as this job is so much fun.

				The reason I am writing is that a former
student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for
some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's
Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some
sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or
so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is
happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back
for a graduate degree.

				Our College of Business does not have
any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master
degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest
students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works
very hard. 

				Does CU still offer the masters degree
in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George
Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under
Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name
and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you
put her in touch with the right person at CU?

				If CU does not have anything available
do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the
information on to Monika?

				Thanks for any help you can provide. 

				Best regards, 

				Jim

Hi Monika -

I have contacted the Head of the Finance Division at the University of
Colorado in Boulder to see if they offer assistantships. He is my major
professor from years ago. I will get back to you as soon as I hear from
him.

I am also forwarding to you in another email some info regarding
potential employment at Tektronix. Even though they will be coming to
OSU and you are in Texas, I would recommend that you forward your resume
to them and tell them you got the information from me. Tell them to call
me if they want to know more about you.

Hello Jim,

I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon.
That's great news!

Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I
would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial
security. My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was
bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer
scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those. 

It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the
right direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to
have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through
with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is
what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in
Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have
great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well
recognized for its talent pool.

If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I
really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have
no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any
contact in the job market I would look into that too. 

Thanks Jim,
Monika

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.
