Just spoke with Peter Cardellichio at RISI who is the person in charge oh Asia and he told me that their forecast for Japan is based on the European prices. He said that prices in Europe and Japan have been pretty close historically thus he uses European prices as a base and adjusts thoem based on what is happening to Asia.

Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study ""Outlook for World Tissue 
Business"" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.


Best regards

"FOEX for 11/06","Hello,
 
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week. 

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. 

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"Weyerhaeuser raising NBSK pulp price for Nov. 1","San Francisco, Oct. 18, 2001 (Forestweb) - Weyerhaeuser Co. will increase the U.S. price of its northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) price by $20/tonne to $500/tonne effective Nov. 1, according to a buyer source. Another buyer source said Weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $20/tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys, ""and I assume on the others."" Weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment. Weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the U.S. price of $480/tonne for Oct. 1, when other North American producers went to $500/tonne. The competitors have complained that Weyerhaeuser's price was a drag on their efforts. Producers and buyers alike have said that $500/tonne has been a hard sell in October, partly because of the market, but also because demand has been so slow. A number of sources say NBSK is at $480/tonne for October, though a few are paying the $500/tonne price. ""I don't think we will pay $500 (in November),"" a buyer said today. ""I think it will be $490."" An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as ""a plus,"" but added, ""Now all we need is for demand to pick up."" Another agent also responded cautiously. ""There is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up, certainly not in the paper business. Without that, (producers) can announce what they want to, but it is not a slam dunk,"" he said. As for October transaction , aid that in most cases, they didn't move. ""I know everyone needs (price increases) and I know the inventories have gone down, but my feeling is they will go up again,"" he said, noting typical late-fall patterns.  said that in contrast to the past, paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices. ""It's going to be a battle, for sure,"" he said. ""There's a lot of fighting going on, a lot (of buyers) are saying they're not going to pay it.""

Hello Monika, 

Hope your day is going great.  I am in the process of preparing your expense report.  Correct me if I am wrong, did you give me a copy of your flight itinerary for San Diego?  Also,  did Andrea know that you were traveling with your husband?  Please advise.

Thank you,

"Chile's Capacity","Hello Karen,

Please find attached Chile's capacity and its expansion projects.

Note that: 
1- Arauco's Constitucion mill might have another alternative capacity of 360,000 tons a year. I was confused because in their annual report the capacity is mentioned many times, each time different numbers. Can I get your input on this. We can discuss it when you have time.

2- There is one modernization project that will increase the capacity of Pacifico mill (CMPC) that will come online on Q1 2003. I did not apply any percentage rate for the project implementation. PLease advise me if I need to do that plus the rates I should use.

3- The projects in red are not impelemented yet and PPPC does not look very optimistic for those. 

4-Sheet 1 of the spread sheet contains the mills' capacities from Jacobs Sirrine which are not far off from the capacities I found in the annual reports.

Let me know if I need to work and improve this further.
 
Finally, I had a lot of fun working on this project  :)

Monika

(Hi Oak and Low Oak) and mixed tropical hardwoods are listed.
 
for this category only pulp characteristics can be provided but not fiber

"Fax the recommendation letters","Jim,
 
I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
   1- Yale
   2- Boston College
   3- University of Massachusetts
   4- Bocconi University (Italy)

Hi -
 
I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically, students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential letters.

In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.
Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with?

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU <mailto:Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU>.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.

PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic life and probably won't be retiring for another few years.

Hi Ron - 

It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun.

The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU?

If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

Thanks for any help you can provide. 

Best regards, 

Jim

"Pulp News","Shipments of market pulp to China totaled 462,157 tonnes in September, down 0.6% compared with August shipments, according to a report last week by China's Materials Information Center.Despite the month-to-month decline last month, market pulp imports into China year-to-date have climbed 33% vs. the same period last year. From January to September 2001, imports have totaled 3.54 million tonnes, reported China's general administration of customs. This might indicate that the Chinese buyers have plenty of stocks available and might slow down their purchasing patterns.


Weak market in the pulp industry continues to push producers into taking further downtime. As expected the bulk of downtime is taken by the Canadian producers who face the highest producing costs.  Today NorskeCanada announced it will take additional curtailment at all four of its BC pulp and paper divisions during the fourth quarter to reflect the continuing difficult market conditions.The company said it will curtail paper production by 60,000 tonnes (including 38,000 tonnes of newsprint) and pulp production by 23,600 tonnes in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter curtailment brings accumulated total paper curtailment for 2001 to 166,000 tonnes (including 112,000 tonnes of newsprint) and pulp curtailment to 121,000 tonnes.

Hello Mr. Temple,

This is a follow-up email to what you talked with Dave Allan on the

characteristics spreadsheet - the most updated version. 

We also have an additional question which is - why each quality
parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use

The stake is being acquired from Mondi Brazil, a subsidiary of Anglo American for a cash consideration of $370 million.
Raul Calfat, CEO of VCP, said, ""This transaction represents an important step for VCP in strengthening our position in the global pulp and paper markets. This also enhances our status as one of the lowest cost producers with outstanding services to our customers. We are very pleased with this opportunity which we believe will create substantial value for our shareholders.""
Andrew Thompson, chairman of Mondi Brazil, said, ""We evaluated the options for our investment in Aracruz and concluded that it was in the interests of our shareholders to sell our stake on these terms. We have valued being party to the development of Aracruz during our time as voting shareholders with board representation. We have been particularly impressed by the vision and leadership of Erling Lorentzen as founder and chairman.

*	For the fifth consecutive month, preliminary data indicates that
market pulp inventories in the NORSCAN region saw a greater-than-historical
average decline of 195,000 tonnes in September (avg decline in Sept. is 108K
tonnes). 
*	As a result of this greater-than-normal decline, total inventories
now stand at 1.525 million tonnes -- nearing the 1.5 million tonne
historical inflection level, and down 24% from the Feb '01 level of 2.006
million tonnes (a 4-year high).
*	The reduction in inventories has certainly not been a result of
strong demand, but rather continued discipline on the part of major
producers -- NORSCAN mills operated at only 78% and shipments equalled 88%
of capacity in Sept.  
*	We are encouraged by this news, and believe that pulp prices could
see an increase in coming months. As we wrote yesterday, we see 2002 as the
cyclical trough yr with NBSK pxs averaging $510/tonne, followed by a 17%
rebound in '03 to $595/tonne, and '04 as the cylical peak yr with avg px of
$695/tonne.

Dear Ms. Causholli:

If your husband is not eligible to receive a Social Security number, he
needs to obtain a ""letter of ineligibility"" from the Social Security
Administration.  With this letter, the Department of Public Safety is able
to continue with the process of issuing him an original driver license.  He
will need to present proof of his identity in order to obtain an orginal
driver license and his foreign passport with a valid U.S. Visa included will
be sufficient.  Your husband will be required to take the written and
driving tests and pay the required fees.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me at this
e-mail address or by phone at (512) 424-5062.

Sincerely,

Rhonda Fleming, Major

I am an analyst working for Enron Industrial Markets in Houston, Texas and I am gathering some information on tissue. I spoke to Rod Young and David Pinault from RISI and they told me to contact you as you do some more extensive studies on tissue usage.

Just got off the phone with the school. Apparently I don't have enough time to submit application but I practically begged for it so they are allowing me to submit a late application.

The only thing is that I won't have an answer until the beginning of January. Classes start in the middle of January. So, is it possible to change the date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me. It would be great.

You are right. I should have included some of my comments on the FOEX recent trends. I''ll keep that in mind for next time.

Monika,

I think an important point to make is not just that the FOEX was up for the period, but that this is the third week of increases for the hardwoods index after several mixed months (both increases and decreases).  However, it's also significant that this week's increase is less than that of last week indicating that the market has not yet found direction.

In terms of the NBSK index, I think it'd be important to point out that this is the first increase in the index since April of this year.  Again, I don't believe this indicates any firm direction in the market, but it's nonetheless a significant event.

"Advice","Hello Jim,

I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon. That's great news!

Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial security. My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those. 

It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool.

If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any contact in the job market I would look into that too. 

Thanks Jim,
Monika

I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
   1- Yale
   2- Boston College

   4- Bocconi University (Italy)

Hi -
 
I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically, students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential letters.

Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with?

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU <mailto:Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU>.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.

Hi Ron - 

It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun.

The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU?

If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

Thanks for any help you can provide. 

Best regards, 

Jim

"Article on Enron and Leaf River mill","G-P Leaf River pulp mill sale deal with Enron falls through
10/24/2001 17:43:03, Forestweb 
By Diane Keaton  San Francisco, Oct. 24, 2001 (Forestweb) -- The tentative deal for Georgia-Pacific Corp. (G-P) to sell its Leaf River market pulp mill to Enron Corp. has collapsed, according to a knowledgeable industry source.  Neither company is speaking publicly about the latest development, citing policies against commenting on rumors. However, the pending arrangement, subject to final approval, was no secret to some pulp and paper industry players (see Forestweb, Oct.19).  Top Enron officials were said to have nixed the agreement this week. Last week in its third quarter earnings statement, the company reported a net loss of $618 million, including a write-off of $1.01 billion.  The source said the deal might still be salvageable at a later date.  The Leaf River mill, in New Augusta, Miss., has the capacity to produce 600,000 tonnes per year. Since February it has produced exclusively softwood kraft pulp.

Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study ""Outlook for World Tissue

capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.

Dear Monika,

We usually send every month Utipulp statistics figures by email, but our
association decided during the last meeting not to diffused them by email in
the future, only to put on our website : www.utipulp.org. That 's mean that
you will not receive email anymore but you can download directly the current
statistics on the website near the 15th of each month.

Best regards,

Mrs BAERTSOEN

Andrea recommends Dr. Cheryl Pickering as an optician (eyeglasses and stuff...)

In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU <mailto:Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU>.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.

Hi Ron - 

It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun.

The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU?

If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

Thanks for any help you can provide. 

Best regards, 

Jim

"RE: fundamentals presentation; pricing","Dave,

I am meeting with Maria Teresa this Wednesday to start working on price forecast.

I am currently working with Andrew on inventory forecast and the procedure is as follows:

Based on the formula (capacity * op. rate) - shipments = forecast inventory.

We used PPPC capacity forecast for the year and divided by 12 to get the monthly forecast. Then multiply this with our own estimate of the operating rate which can be an average of the last 2 months or the operating rate of last month carried forward, or the last month's operating rate difference with the average and apply that difference to calculate the next  month op. rate. 

We also estimate the level of shipments as the last 3 years average for the month we are trying to forecast.

So far we have only tested September and the forecast was pretty close to the actual.


let me know if this is what you requested,
Thanks,
Monika

"I am still here","Hello Jim,

It's been a long time since I last wrote you but here I am again. I am still working for Enron, but I moved away from Oregon. Now me and my husband are living in Houston, Texas. 
I worked in Portland until May of this year and then I though of moving away from Oregon just because opportunities are not as big there. In Portland I wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time. I got tired of that job because of shift work. This summer I joined the forests products department and right now I do analysis for the traders. I ahve taken a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take some more. My goal is to move to a trader's position, mostly financial trader to work with derivatives but we will see what happens. Right now I am learning about the market, and how it functions. 

I plan on taking some classes next term at Rice University in Houston. I need to have better mathematical skills and I will start taking math classes at night after work. We will see how this goes. i have to prepare myself well for the future. 

That's all on work side. 
Moving to Houston was quite a change. The  weather especially. Right now though the weather is great, it's sunny and in the mid-70s to 80s. I love it. Koli likes Portland better. Houston is a much bigger city and a little more dangerous. I like it though, what I miss is Corvallis and school. I miss business school at OSU and studying for finance classes. I want to go back to school eventually and get both MBA and PHD so I can teach. I would love to be a professor. 

So how are you? How is your wife? Your kids? Is anything new happening? What about your parents in NY? Are they OK from all that has happened?  
What about OSU? Anything new there? How is prof. Moulton? Say hi to him from me. What about the students? Are you still demanding of them? You know I remember that I put a lot of work in your classes.

We plan to go home this Christmas and meet our families. My parents ask me about you all the time. They had the greatest time when they visited me here. 

well that's all for now but I will keep in touch more often. Let me know how thigs are going with you,

say hi to your wife from me
best wishes,
Monika

Monika,

Good that you put some analysis with the price changes.  I'd be a bit careful about declaring that prices are expected to continue increasing through November --- many market observers (particularly Mr. Ross Hay-Roe) believe there's a good chance that the US$15/metric ton increase the producers already received will begin to erode in the next few weeks.  I think it's important that we give air time to all the possibilities, especially in light of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the market.  Thanks.

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. 

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.

"RE: Pulp","Amy,

You could probably add expected capacity projections to see how Asian capacity will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to let's say other areas of the world. I remember that in the RISI conference the speakers were saying that Asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that of Latin America but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will major pulp buyers.

Anyways, you can find the capacity expansion data in the PPPC website. Let me know because I have some printed copies too.

Hi Monika -

I have contacted the Head of the Finance Division at the University of
Colorado in Boulder to see if they offer assistantships. He is my major
professor from years ago. I will get back to you as soon as I hear from
him.

I am also forwarding to you in another email some info regarding
potential employment at Tektronix. Even though they will be coming to
OSU and you are in Texas, I would recommend that you forward your resume
to them and tell them you got the information from me. Tell them to call
me if they want to know more about you.

Hello Jim,

I was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon.
That's great news!

Well, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I
would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial
security. My job prospects don't look good either now that Enron was
bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer
scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those. 

It would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the
right direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to
have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through
with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is
what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in
Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have
great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well
recognized for its talent pool.

If you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I
really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have
no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any
contact in the job market I would look into that too. 

Thanks Jim,
Monika

"Foex is down again","Today FOEX published its weekly index for pulp:

For the first time in weeks both the softwoods and the hardwoods show signs of weaknesses again.  

NBSK was down $US0.48 or 0.1% after four weeks of price increases.
BHKP was Euro 466 down Euro 3.34. Expressed in US dollars BHKP was $US416.09 down $US2.33 or 0.56%.
These decline happens despite the recent efforts from the biggest pulp producers, including Weyerhaeuser, to raise prices. This might be a sign of the fact that the market fundamentals  do not support the price increases in pulp. 


The average FOEX for October is:
NBSK: $US 460.68 up $10.26 from September
BHKP:$US 414.76 up $13.67 from the September level

Subject:	newsprint mill conversion

Hello Team,

Tembec Inc. may back a controversial $450-million project to convert the mothballed Chandler newsprint mill in Quebec to make high-quality magazine paper.  The Chandler mill was shut in 1999 by the former owner, Abitibi, due to high costs.   The Quebec government and the union-backed Quebec Solidarity Fund now effectively own Chandler and are negotiating with Tembec to tie up the conversion project by year-end.       A comfort to newsprint producers as potential newsprint capacity is diverted else where at a time when the market is sitting in a supply glut.

Subject:	World market pulp inventories fall nearly 10 percent  

The good news for the pulp producers continue as worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 345,000 tonnes in September from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. World inventories have fallen seven consecutive months as producers reduced their stocks 9.7 percent from opening levels.
World producer stocks closed September at 3.073 million tonnes, representing 33 days of supply and a four-day reduction from August levels. Producer inventory results are 19.4 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. The inventory results were by far the largest single month reduction this year. The year's prior high was in June, when producers brought down inventories by 171,000 tonnes but faced a bloated 3.528 million tonnes of stock. 
September production of 2.525 million tonnes tumbled 10.2 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.812 million tonnes. Production levels were 5.9 percent lower than the prior month. 
Global shipments improved both month-over-month and compared to the same period last year. Shipments of 2.870 million tonnes rose 2.8 percent higher than year-ago results of 2.792 million tonnes, and surged by 4.4 percent vs. August despite a slower week of activity following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Producers operated at 84 percent of capacity in September, down 11 percent from the same time last year when producers ran at 95 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced another 5 points to 95 percent, PPPC reported.

Hi Monika,

Your husband needs to complete the Form SS-5, attached.  Take it to the SSA office, you can also do this on his behalf.  However, you need all the documentation listed and your passport or drivers license.  He (or you) need to specifically request, from the SSA office, a ""denial letter"".  The denial letter will be sent to your home.  Upon its receipt, he needs to take the denial letter in lieu of a social security card with his Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) and apply for one then.

Margaret just advised that your husband received a Texas Drivers License.  Please advise if the above instructions are different than the process you utilized.

Subject:	Question on driver's licence for H4 visa holders

Hello Margaret,

I am trying to figure out how my husband can obtain a driver's licence in the state of Texas but the office of social security, IRS, and DPS all give me different answers and are not helpful at all. We are confused. My husband is on H4 visa and he does not have a social security but the state of Texas requires the social security to obtain a driver's licence. He has a tax-payer SSN but that did not work for the licence. 

Do you know what the law is in this case? Can we ask Enron lawyers about this problem? 
Common sense tells me that there can be a way for him to drive here but I don't know how.

Please help us,

Thanks a lot

As a follow-up to our conversation last week I have tried to get the list of mills from PPPC but they are not responding to my requests. There is another way to compile that by using Jacobs Sirrine database information.

Second, I changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest NORSCAN inventory number that I got from PPPC and so the forecast for October changed a bit, more in line with the historical average now.

Let me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet.

The only thing is that I won't have an answer until the beginning of January. Classes start in the middle of January. So, is it possible to change the date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me. It would be great.

"Fish dishes","You need the following ingredients:

Trout Fish (medium size)
About 4 big yellow onions- chopped into little pieces
About 4 pieces of garlic- also chopped in little pieces
Tomato Sauce
Red Pepper
Black Pepper
Bay Leaf
Lemon Juice
Salt
White wine
Vegetable Oil

The process:

1- Clean and wash the fish. Cut the head off you don't need that. Place the fish in a pan and pour lemon juice in it. Leave it in lemon juice while preparing the sauce.

2- In another pan put some vegetable oil and fry the chopped onions. After about 4 min add a little black pepper, red pepper, garlic, salt and bay leaf and stir. 
3- Continue stirring until the onions are a little brownish in color. Then add the tomato sauce and continue stirring. You will have a reddish sauce ready.
4- In a baking pan put the sauce that you prepared above and open a free space in the middle for the fish. Place the fish in the middle. Then pour lemon juice and white wine on the whole pan and put the pan in the oven.

Keep an eye on it as fish is cooked really fast. When you serve it ad lemon juice again. 


Another way of cooking the trout fish (much easier and I think tastier)

Get a small trout this time., 
After cleaning it place it in a baking pan. Then add olive oil into it (lots of it), lemon juice,  chopped tomatoes (about 2 tomatoes) , and olives. 
Just bake it and there you have it. Again when you serve it you need to add some more lemon juice.
 It's delicious!



Try any of these and let me know how they taste. Have fun
Monika

"Brazil's paper maker Klabin to restructure","SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct 15, 2001 (Reuters) - Brazilian paper and pulp maker Industrias Klabin Papel e Celulose SA said on Monday it would restructure its units in a cost-cutting drive it hopes will save 60 million reais ($22 million) per year. 
Klabin, one of Brazil's top producers of paper, tissue and wood pulp, will incorporate its Klamasa, KIV, Industrias Klabin and Igaras units under its subsidiary Klabin Riocell SA , the company said in a statement. 
Riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be renamed Klabin SA. Minority shareholders in Klabin will be given shares in Riocell at par, Klabin's Director General Josemar Verillo told Reuters. 
The restructuring, to be completed by December, should reduce administrative, operational, financial and tax costs. It will also improve operating synergies, allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group's transparency for investors, Klabin said. 
""We have a lot of business between the group. That leads to operational and financial inefficiencies,"" Verillo said. 
The company said it expects to save about 60 million reais ($22 million) per year and could trim staff in the long term as a result of the restructuring. 
In a separate statement responding to an inquiry by the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 10 percent higher in 2001, driven by exports and a depreciation of Brazil's currency. The company posted net revenues of 1.9 billion reais ($684 million) in 2000.

Subject:	fiber morphology study

Monika, I found the Jacobs-Sirrine proposal on the fiber study; you can get a copy from me.

They included a matrix on which they would display various fiber characteristics, which I'm attaching. << File: Fiber Morphology.xls >>  Cecil and I went over it and he suggested some changed, which are incorporated here. The only one he wants to add that isn't reflected here---but which we need to tell them---is that we want to know why each quality parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) application.

Let's go over this Monday morning.

Dave

"RE: Utipulp stocks for September","The good news in terms of pricing is that consumption rose this month by 16%, and higher consumption levels will deplete inventories and consumers will need to replace those inventories faster. Hopefully consumption will continue to grow over the next several months.

Monika, this is interesting. To summarize, are you saying that inventories are below a year ago (which is good for producers) but they rose when they normally fall (bad for producers)? What does this mean for pricing?

"World market pulp inventories decline for sixth consecutive month","SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 66,000 tonnes in August from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. August marked the sixth month in a row that world inventories had fallen as producers dropped their stocks 1.9 percent from opening levels. 
World producer stocks closed August at 3.402 million tonnes, representing 37 days of supply, a day less than July results. Producer inventory levels are 33.3 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. Although stocks are still high on a year-over-year basis, recent results still represented a strong improvement. Back in June, world producer stocks were 74.8 percent higher than the same period last year. 
August production of 2.683 million tonnes declined 2.3 percent from last month and tumbled 10.3 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.992 million tonnes. Global shipments totaled 2.750 million tonnes, dipping 1.9 percent from the 2.698 million tonnes recorded in August of last year. 
Producers operated at 88 percent of capacity in August, the same rate as both June and July of this year. That compared to world producers' year-ago operating rate of 103 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced 2 points from the prior month to 90 percent, PPPC reported. 
World inventory figures include totals from North America, Nordic countries, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Swaziland. Countries that do not report inventories include Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand. 
World producers shifted 26,000 tonnes between the close of July and last month's opening inventories.

"RE: Norscan Statistics for October 2001","Dave,

As PPPC explains in the attached file the reason for the low levels of inventory was because the consumer inventories had reached such a low level (below normal) throughout the whole year that now consumers are rebuilding the stocks.

Subject:	Norscan Statistics for October 2001

Hello,

Please the attached PRELIMINARY CHEMICAL MARKET PULP REPORT from PPPC.

Highlights:

Inventories decreased by 48,000 metric tonnes, from the 1.549 million level, to reach the 1.501 million level. This is a positive development for pulp producers especially when compared to the hitorically flat change in October.

BUT in October the the lowering of inventories did not come as a result of producer discipline. In fact Norscan producers operated at 90% in October compared to the 79% in September.

What brought the reduction in inventories is the increase in shipments this month. Shipments were 1.866 million compared to the 1.771 million level in September. Demand was at a record high for the month of October due to strong pick-up sales in North America and Western Europe. Also contributing to the high demand were the shipments to Asia/Africa.
See the table below for the summary of statistics:

Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study ""Outlook for World Tissue 
Business"" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.


Best regards

The reason why your check went to Portland is because in 2000 the ISC created a US01 address for you so that you would receive your checks while you were in Portland.  I have gone into SAP and delimited your US01 address and you will receive your 10/15 check at your 2906 mail stop.

"World market pulp inventories fall nearly 10 percent","The good news for the pulp producers continue as worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 345,000 tonnes in September from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. World inventories have fallen seven consecutive months as producers reduced their stocks 9.7 percent from opening levels.
World producer stocks closed September at 3.073 million tonnes, representing 33 days of supply and a four-day reduction from August levels. Producer inventory results are 19.4 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. The inventory results were by far the largest single month reduction this year. The year's prior high was in June, when producers brought down inventories by 171,000 tonnes but faced a bloated 3.528 million tonnes of stock. 
September production of 2.525 million tonnes tumbled 10.2 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.812 million tonnes. Production levels were 5.9 percent lower than the prior month. 
Global shipments improved both month-over-month and compared to the same period last year. Shipments of 2.870 million tonnes rose 2.8 percent higher than year-ago results of 2.792 million tonnes, and surged by 4.4 percent vs. August despite a slower week of activity following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Producers operated at 84 percent of capacity in September, down 11 percent from the same time last year when producers ran at 95 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced another 5 points to 95 percent, PPPC reported.

Dave,

Just got off the phone with the school. Apparently I don't have enough time to submit application but I practically begged for it so they are allowing me to submit a late application.

The only thing is that I won't have an answer until the beginning of January. Classes start in the middle of January. So, is it possible to change the date of departure until Jan 11 in the letter that you wrote for me. It would be great.

Thanks,
Monika

Subject:	FW: Question on driver's license for H4 visa holders

Hi Monika,

Your husband needs to complete the Form SS-5, attached.  Take it to the SSA office, you can also do this on his behalf.  However, you need all the documentation listed and your passport or drivers license.  He (or you) need to specifically request, from the SSA office, a ""denial letter"".  The denial letter will be sent to your home.  Upon its receipt, he needs to take the denial letter in lieu of a social security card with his Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) and apply for one then.

Margaret just advised that your husband received a Texas Drivers License.  Please advise if the above instructions are different than the process you utilized.

Bobbi

Hello Margaret,

I am trying to figure out how my husband can obtain a driver's licence in the state of Texas but the office of social security, IRS, and DPS all give me different answers and are not helpful at all. We are confused. My husband is on H4 visa and he does not have a social security but the state of Texas requires the social security to obtain a driver's licence. He has a tax-payer SSN but that did not work for the licence. 

Do you know what the law is in this case? Can we ask Enron lawyers about this problem? 
Common sense tells me that there can be a way for him to drive here but I don't know how.

Please help us,

Thanks a lot

Subject: SSN requirement

Dear Ms. Causholli:

If your husband is not eligible to receive a Social Security number, he
needs to obtain a ""letter of ineligibility"" from the Social Security
Administration.  With this letter, the Department of Public Safety is able
to continue with the process of issuing him an original driver license.  He
will need to present proof of his identity in order to obtain an orginal
driver license and his foreign passport with a valid U.S. Visa included will
be sufficient.  Your husband will be required to take the written and
driving tests and pay the required fees.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me at this
e-mail address or by phone at (512) 424-5062.

Sincerely,

Rhonda Fleming, Major
Driver License Division

Also, tissue facts are taken from a bank of America report as RISI does not have any studies on it. I found one guy in Germany that seems to do quite an extensive work on tissue. I sent you an email yesterday stating what he can offer us and what the costs are.

Also note that fluff pulp data is very limited. I am waiting David Pinault from RISI to get back to me as he is researching and digging inside his organization to find anything on the fluff pulp. All these data can be added to the presentation upon availiability.

Subject: Fax the recommendation letters


Jim,
 
I was thinking that since I do not have enough time to prepare the appplication process, it would be a good idea for me to fax the recommendation letter forms to you first so you know what to expect and maybe start writing. In the meantime, I will mail those forms as well as envelopes because you have to retunrn those to me. The envelopes would have to be signed across the seal.
There will be a total of four schools that I am applying to.
   1- Yale
   2- Boston College
   3- University of Massachusetts
   4- Bocconi University (Italy)
 
Thanks,
Monika

Hi -
 
I would contact the other finance guys here. Who knows, they may have some great leads. As far as the letter is concerned, I would be happy to do it. Generally, however, each grad school has a specific recommendation form that they want references to fill out. So let me know after you get the required info from the schools. Typically, students just send it to me as I will probably have to submit it directly to the grad school people as they generally want confidential letters.

Jim,
 
I did write to Eric Hughson about the PhD program and I am waiting for his response.
In the meantime can you write me a recommendation letter. I know you don't like to do this but if you would it would be great. I am planning to apply to about 3-4 schools for now. I will mail the paperwork to you on Monday.
Also, should I contact the other finance professors at OSU trying to see what they can help me with?
Thanks for all your help. I will keep you posted.

Hi Again Monika -
 
Here is what I heard from my former professor. If I were you, I would contact Eric Hughson about CU's PhD program in Finance. It is worth a try.
 
I will contact you if I hear about other opportunities either for graduate study or employment opportunities. Keep me posted.

Hi Jim,
It has been a long time between communications.  We no longer offer an MS in Finance (however, I believe the Denver Campus does).  We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each year--thus it is very competitive.  Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU <mailto:Eric.Hughson@Colorado.EDU>.  Unfortunately, I don't have any specific recommendations.
Ron
PS--I also still like the teaching part of the academic life and probably won't be retiring for another few years.

Hi Ron - 

It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated. I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I. Moreover, I don't have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun.

The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Master's Degree in Finance or PhD. Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship. She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time. Given what is happening at Enron, I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree.

Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also don't offer a master degree in finance or PhD.  Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years. She is incredibly bright and works very hard. 

Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships. If I recall, George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU. If so, can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you. Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU?

If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the information on to Monika?

Thanks for any help you can provide. 

Best regards, 

Jim

Thanks for sending me the report. I have read it and I am in the process of preparing a summary of it. I  have a couple of questions for you though.

First, can you explain a little bit about the TAD technology, like how it is done and so on. Also what does TAD stand for?

Second, what does AfH stand for?

Third, the consumption numbers for all the continents were given for year 1999. Do you have them for 2000 yet?

Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study ""Outlook for World Tissue 
Business"" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.

"North American Printing & Writing Paper- September","In September North American paper demand continued to fall. This is not positive news for the paper and pulp industry.  The following is what PPPC released:
North American printing/writing paper inventories dropped by about 6% from August to the end of September, but shipments, production, and demand stayed depressed from year-ago levels.
Total North American printing/writing production was down 11.0% in September compared with a year ago, to 2.091 million tonnes, PPPC reported. Total shipments were off 9.9% to 2.224 million tonnes. Total inventories decreased 133,000 tonnes from August to September to 2.145 million tonnes and were 313,000 tonnes or 12.7% lower than in September last year. The industry overall operating rate (shipments to capacity) in September was 84%, down from 88% in August and down from 96% a year ago. 
Uncoated free-sheet accounted for most of the inventory drop, according to September statistics released yesterday by the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. North American demand was down 10.2% in September to 1.038 million tonnes
Coated free-sheet (woodfree) demand was down 11.2% in September while coated groundwood (mechanical) papers demand was off 7.5%, PPPC reported.
