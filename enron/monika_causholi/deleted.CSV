"GREEK FESTIVAL","WAAAAAZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!

Its Greek Festival time again. October 4 through the 7th (Thurs to Sun). We're gonna bust it out GREEK    STYLE. And I dont want any smart comments about the Greek Festival being in Montrose. I've heard them all. The festival is really easy to find. It is on Yoakum between West Alabama and Westheimer, near St Thomas University, near Sky Bar, near La Mora, near La Colombe D'or and near a few other things. Also, there is a Greek party at Mykonos Island Restaurant  in Shephard Plaza at 1030 pm Saturday night. Everyone is welcome to come. Let me know, because half of Houston and all of Montrose is going to be there and you cannot miss it.

Monika, for our pulp specialist who's coming to town on Thursday, could you see if one of the pulp originators has a basic presentation on Enron's forest products business that we could e-mail to him before Wednesday afternoon?

David,

Thanks for all the info from you and Nyree.  Dinner Thursday is fine.  The
only stuff I have not got is info about your plans, mill ownership, etc.
Perhaps you would prefer to discuss when I see you at 0900 on Thursday.
That's OK with me.  How about a list of assets you own or investments you
have in the forest products business?  Whatever you can send would be
appreciated.

See you Thursday.

Allen

Allen,

First of all, dress code is business casual (khakis etc.). My assistant,
Nyree Chanaba, will get back to you with particulars on the hotel. It
will probably be the Hyatt, which is kitty-corner from our office. But
whichever hotel it is, the concierge will be able to direct you to the
Enron Building: it's well-known, and we'll have you within 2-3 blocks of
our office at the most.

The morning session is for quiet conversations with anybody who wants
one-on-one time with you. At this point I don't know whether that will
be a lot of people or a few (we're in the middle of vacation time so
it's hard to predict attendance), but I would say 9 a.m. would be good.
Go to the lobby of the building and ask the security guards to call me
or Nyree (we're on the 29th floor).

If it's OK with you, why don't you pay your hotel bill and then fax me
the bill when you get home on Friday so we can cut a check.

If you're not too tired of Enron people at that time, I'd like to take
you out to dinner on Thursday night.

As to the projector, we'll have something set up; in case the connection
doesn't work we also have laptops we can hook up.

We'll communicate more as the week goes on. We look forward to seeing
you!

Dave

Hi, David,

A couple of questions:

*  dress code for visit
*  address and name of hotel.  My plane (DL 1857)is scheduled to arrive
at
1853.  I plan to go directly to the hotel.
*  do you want me to pay the bill and rebill you when I send the
invoice?
*  directions from the hotel to your office?  When do you want me to be
there on Thursday?
*  I plan to bring my laptop with several ppt presentations to show.  Do
you
have a hookup for the laptop to a projector?  I 	plan to leave a
copy of the
ppt slides with you if you have a zip file that can download them from
my
laptop.
*  I believe you were going to send me some info about Enron's plans and
objectives, now that I am on the team and have 	signed the
confidentiality
agreements.
*  any other questions I need to ask?

See you on Thursday.

Allen

"Finnish paper and board output falls on year-earlier period","paperloop.com
HELSINKI, July 30 (Reuters) - Production of paper and board at mills in Finland fell two percent year-on-year in the first half of 2001 to 6.37 million tonnes, reflecting the global economic slowdown, the industry said on Monday. Finland is the world's second biggest exporter of forest products after Canada.
""In Finland, the forest industry's production in the second quarter of the year was about five percent less than in the first quarter,"" the Finnish Forest Industries Federation said in a statement. Production rose in the mechanical wood industry, but fell in the pulp and paper industry, according to the trade association. 
Production curtailments in the second quarter knocked average paper and board mill operating rates in Finland down to 86 percent from 93 percent in the first quarter, it said.
Paper and board output in the second quarter fell by 377,000 tonnes, or by about 11 percent versus the first quarter, according to the federation. ""The production of all paper grades fell in the second quarter, the decrease was most noticeable in fine paper production,"" the federation added.
Pulp production at Finnish mills fell 1.1 percent year-on-year in the first half to 5.62 million tonnes, but pulp output rose two percent in the second quarter on the same period a year ago, the federation said.
Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso, the world's number two papermaker, last week posted a sharp drop in second-quarter profits due to massive production cuts in the face of weak demand and said the market would remain difficult this year.
Finnish fine paper group, M-real, and tissue producer, Metsa Tissue, are scheduled to report second-quarter results on Wednesday, with the world's third-biggest papermaker, UPM-Kymmene due to post results on Thursday.

1) I think you are all aware that we need to develop a market overview presentation on each of your markets similar to what Monika is pulling together on pulp. Have you started outlining what would go in your presentation?

2) Please give me a short (2-3 bullet) summary of what you are doing on pricing and inventory forecasting. I want to develop a summary report for Bob Crane.

"DRI/WEFA Audio Conference - October 9, 2001","On Tuesday, October 9, 2001, DRI/WEFA presented an audio conference regarding the outlook for the general US and World economies, presentations for which are attached.  

In summary, DRI/WEFA believes that the economy will experience a deeper downturn than previously forecast, reaching a low during the second quarter of 2002.  Following this bottom, they expect the economy to experience a sharp ""V"" recovery in 2003, reaching levels that are comparable to the second half of 2000, driven by fiscal stimuli from US government and monetary stimuli from the Federal Reserve.  They expect the world economy to follow the US pattern of growth, although some countries may experience slower growth rates .

DRI/WEFA has made the following baseline assumptions (probability 50-60%):
There will be no more terrorist attacks in the near future; 
US counter-attacks will have no permanent negative impact on confidence or oil prices;
Consumer and business confidence will recover after three to four months; 
Oil prices will remain weak; and
More fiscal and monetary stimuli are in the pipeline.

Downside scenarios include (probability 25-30%):
Further terrorist attacks and/or an unsuccessful US retaliation;
Oil prices spike again; and
Consumer and business confidence falls further and doesn't recover as quickly as anticipated.

The upside scenario includes the following (probability 15-20%):
US retaliation is considered to be successful;
Consumer and business confidence rebounds quickly; and
The recession in the US and the rest of the world is mild.

These conclusions are not much different from those presented by Goldman-Sachs several weeks ago, but may still be somewhat optimistic.  Yana Kristal is revising her economic forecast for presentation in the near future.

Please let Yana or me know if you have any questions.

"Trade flows by Asian port","
FYI.  There is a private company called Piers which tracks trade flows by ports by examining the vessel manifests and bills of lading.  They have a website which Luis Velez is familiar with and is www.piers.com.  While they don't track all regions of the world, they do provide data by port.  Unfortunately, this information requires payment.  I would suggest looking on their website to see what they have to offer.

Methodology

The methodology we have been using to gather information for the Forest Product End-User Report consists of the following:

Collecting the following information from the individual product specialists:
Industry characteristics
Trends of the market segments
Shipment Information
Ideas on target markets and customers in their product specialties
Issues in their market segments 	

Information from various published reports, including the North American Factbook,  Jacobs Sirrene, various industry publications, and news sources.

With this information, we are identifying the top 10 producers and consumers in each market segment.  Each company profile consists of the following information: company description, facilities, products, business strategies, shipments, production, and capacity numbers.  Attached is a matrix outlining the identified companies, progress of report preparation, and the analysts assigned to cover each of the companies.  Since these analysts are new to our group and require training, some of the initial reports are taking more time.  As indicated previously, we appreciate any direction from you and your staff on establishing priorities.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see a draft of the information that we have been gathering.

Thank you,

Stacey

Below I have included a link that I think many of you will find interesting.  It's a short article primarily about energy.  More importantly however, it's a great real-world example of how correlations, regressions and trend analysis among commodities and macro-indicators yield valuable insights.  It's proof that what we do matters!

"Softwood pulp prices stabilize in Asia, some hardwood producers plan price rises","SINGAPORE, Aug. 20, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Widespread downtime taken by Norscan softwood pulp producers has begun to affect the Asian pulp market. Prices have stabilized for the first time since September last year. 
Low-priced radiata pine pulp from Latin America continues to hold down prices for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp (NBSK). ""We believe that the current low prices for the grade will stay until well-stocked Chinese traders deplete inventories accumulated since April,"" one major buyer said. 
Some Indonesian and Thai pulp producers hope to introduce a $10-20/tonne price increase for their mixed tropical hardwood and eucalyptus grades in September, followed by a further $40-60/tonne rise in the fourth quarter. But buyers and some other Indonesian pulp producers are skeptical about the increase's likelihood of success as there are ample supplies of Brazilian eucalyptus selling at competitive prices across Asia.
On top of that, some Indonesian pulp producers are burdened with debt and face wood supply shortages resulting from slower than anticipated progress in the planting of concession areas, illegal logging and other forestry issues. Trading volumes of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood are in fact diminishing.
Indonesian producers are currently promoting plantation-based acacia pulp, a move welcomed by environmental groups. But distributors and traders in China have received complaints from customers about the grade, in particular, from board producers. ""We seldom hear complaints in other Asian markets. The Chinese customers need some time to get accustomed to the grade,"" one Indonesian producer explained.

Warriors,

I have attached the outline for the Forest Product Report requested by Rob Saltiel.  The intent is to develop individual binders and presentations for each of the product specialties (lumber, pulp, newsprint, containerboard, and recovered paper products).  This will serve as the ""backbone"" of our product information gathering efforts. At this juncture, the focus will be on North America, although eventually; it will be expanded into other geographical regions.

In the outline, there are references to ""Warriors"" as a source of information. The information that I am requesting from each of 
you, for your respective product specialties, is as follows:  

Industry characteristics
Trends
Shipment Information
Ideas on target markets and customers in your product specialties
Issues in your product specialties
Suggestions and anything else you can think of.


If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Stacey

Pulp Update: Inventory Rise in July Well Below Average; Goldman Sachs High
Yield Research; 8/14/01

Norscan pulp inventories rose just 4,000 tonnes in July, which is well below
the typical seasonal increase of approximately 150,000 tonnes.  Amidst all
the bad news about the pulp environment, this is good news.  Producer
downtime is certainly helping.  However, pulp prices remain quite weak, and
inventories of 1.78 million tonnes are still too high to allow for any
tightening of supply and demand in the short term.

We will distribute details of the July pulp report once they are available.

"U.S. pulp spot market prices flat","SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - In U.S. East spot markets, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp prices held flat even as buyers indicated some low-priced deals in softwood transactions. Some industry sources indicated that a closing between list prices and spot transactions could point to tighter supplies in spot markets later this year. Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest held at $410-440/tonne, 11.5% below August contract prices, paperloop sources said. Although there have been anecdotal cases of buyers procuring NBSK at $400/tonne in the Northeast, a producer asserted the deals must have come from one supplier.
Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also remained flat, holding its $390-420/tonne range of two weeks ago. 
Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK), the only grade to hold flat in spot markets two weeks ago, remained unchanged at $340-380/tonne. Evidently moving to protect pricing, some mills last week curbed supplies even though buys were said to be available at typical spot prices. In a growing recent trend, one NBHK supplier closed a five-month deal at a fixed price of $370/tonne, on the high end of current spot prices but barely covering its cash cost of production.
Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) was unchanged and closed the week at $330-370/tonne.

"Canadian pulp producer Skeena Cellulose could shut down operations","SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Skeena Cellulose, Inc. could be forced to close in another month because the local government is unwilling to continue subsidizing the Vancouver, B.C.-based firm's operations, Northern Development Minister Rick Thorpe told The Canadian Press.
Skeena's credit line expired on Thursday, and the government is now working with the Toronto-Dominion Bank to secure a one-month financial extension for its mill in Prince Rupert.
The mill, which has capacity to produce about 478,000 tonnes/yr of northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK), has taken considerable downtime this year. Skeena's 450 tonnes/day ""B"" line has remained shuttered since January, losing at least 12,000 tonnes per month or some 30 percent of its capacity. In July, the firm closed its ""A"" line as well, which has effectively shut its pulp production.
The Canadian government has been trying to sell the mill since it bailed out the struggling firm back in 1997 but in the current difficult pulp market few expected a deal could be made in the short term. But Thorpe warned the government would shut down the mill if that doesn't happen. The province, which owns 58.5 percent of Skeena, has invested about $178 million in the firm. Toronto-Dominion Bank, employees, and unions own the balance.
The latest development follows speculation from various British Columbia sources in recent weeks that Skeena would be shut down. ""There is speculation that (Skeena's second) line is down for good. It's highly likely that it will never come up again,"" said a B.C.-based source, who noted the operation has continued to absorb tax revenues.

"U.S. uncoated free-sheet prices fall slightly in August, but shipments improve","SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 29, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Uncoated papers production has been restricted this year, with extensive downtime and permanent mill closures reducing market tonnage and thus stabilizing prices. Even with some increased demand, uncoated papers in North America, especially free-sheet, will depend on possible flooding in a near future of greater capacity. 
Overall, prices for uncoated papers fell slightly in August compared to July, with repro bond dipping on the low end. As expected, demand for repro bond, the most popular grade of uncoated free-sheet (UCFS), picked up in July, and several merchants reported greater volumes of paper per sale. But demand is still low compared with last year. 
One source, crediting downtime with the uncoated float through the weak market of the last six months, felt that prices would only dip further, as mills have stopped taking downtime. 
Trade book pickup? Web 50-lb trade book gained some ground on the low end. The strength of trade book transactions is due the seasonal pick up in book publishing, which takes place through September and October and targets the educational and holiday markets. 
With the temporary idling of several Pulp & Paper of America (PPA) machines, owned by parent company American Tissue Inc., the already small coterie of trade book manufacturers will benefit from the lost tonnage, especially in lightweight book papers, according to one merchant. He added that if demand continues, the decrease in product might have a ripple effect and drive prices up. 
Permanent tonnage cuts in a variety of uncoated grades will aid the ailing market by better reflecting lowered demand. Mill inventories have already benefited. RISI's forecast of an uncoated upturn in the fourth quarter is also based upon those capacity curtailments, and the infrequent practice of swing capacity from coated to uncoated manufacturing. 
Downtime taken. Downtime taken by several companies, including Finch, Pruyn & Co. and Weyerhaeuser Co. was popularly used as a means of upgrading older, less efficient machines, thereby adding more capacity to the uncoated mix overall. 
In addition, some so-called permanent machine shuts will simply serve as space providers for a future of more efficient and larger volume-producing machines. Willamette Industries' mothballing of two UCFS will be replaced with a larger and more efficient UCFS machine in Kingsport, Tenn., for a difference of an additional 207,000 tons/yr. 
Converted papers, such as forms bond, have held well price-wise, mainly because so few mills produce them. However, one West Coast company source said, ""Volume of forms bond has eroded 5-7%,"" speculating that the grade would soon be completely replaced by cutsheets.

"UPM-Kymmene boosts pulp and paper capacity at Rauma mill in Finland","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, Aug. 7, 2001 (paperloop.com) - UPM-Kymmene has unveiled details of the Euro 60 million ($53 million) PM 1 and pulp line rebuild at its Rauma mill in Finland. The revamp of the mill's integrated pulp line will boost mechanical pulp capacity from 1,500 tonnes/day to 1,700 tonnes/day. 
The company has not yet chosen the suppliers for the scheme but expects to reach a decision by the end of October this year. UPM-Kymmene has already started planning work for the scheme and installation is due to kick off next year. The rebuilt PM 1 is scheduled to restart at the beginning of 2003. The additional pulp output is slated to come on stream during the second half of 2002. 
The integrated pulp line feeds PM 1 and the mill's other three machines. The Rauma mill's pulp production has lagged behind while the PMs' capacities have risen during the past few years without major investments. The extra pulp output will enable the units to boost their paper production.
The details of the pulp upgrade have not yet been hammered out, but the plans for the PM revamp have taken shape. PM 1's press and dryer sections will be modernized and the coaters will be rebuilt. The PM 1 revamp will raise the machine's high-brightness lightweight coated paper (LWC) capacity from 250,000 tonnes/yr to 300,000 tonnes/yr.
The Rauma mill has a total capacity of 1,140,000 tonnes/yr of magazine paper. PM 2 produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of supercalendered (SC) paper, while PM 3's SC capacity is 240,000 tonnes/yr. PM 4 churns out 400,000 tonnes/yr of LWC.

"Analysts see Stora Enso and IP merger as unlikely","BRUSSELS, Aug. 22, 2001, (paperloop.com) - Analysts believe a merger between industry giants Stora Enso and International Paper (IP) is unlikely, despite media reports linking the pair. 
The two companies are leaders in the industry, with IP heading this year's PPI Top 150 survey and Stora Enso coming in fourth. While not completely writing off the possibility of a deal, the sheer size of the companies led a number of analysts to question whether competition authorities would green-light a merger. If any deal was to go ahead, most analysts agreed that some divestments would be necessary.
Hannu Nyman of Conventum and H?kon Lerstad of ABG Sundal Collier both felt a union would create competition problems. Nyman said there would be too much market dominance in some sectors in the US. Lerstad agreed, saying that if the pair joined forces, they would enjoy a market share of approximately 40% in the US coated paper market. But UBS Warburg analyst Denis Christie thought the companies might be able to get away with this, pointing out that Abitibi-Consolidated has a similar market share in the US newsprint sector.
One analyst, who preferred not to be named, said that if there was any truth to the rumors, it was more likely to be on a smaller scale, with the companies perhaps talking about a few assets rather than a full-blown merger. 
Nyman does expect to see further consolidation in the paper industry, but on a smaller scale. ""I am more inclined to believe that the big players...will continue to grow by buying small and medium-sized companies and expanding their coverage by area that way.""
Stora Enso recently gained a firm foothold in the North American market through its acquisition of Consolidated Papers. When that merger was announced, the company suffered a shareholder backlash, with its share price dropping 15%. 
Although doubting the likelihood of a union with IP, Nyman said that if a merger did take place, Stora Enso shareholders would benefit due to IP's stronger performing shares. ""It would probably result in a 50% improvement on Stora Enso's current share price,"" he added.
A company spokesman said Stora Enso has a policy of not commenting on market rumors. The firm would neither confirm nor deny the speculation. But if a merger was to go ahead, the new entity would have combined sales of around $32 billion and a paper and board output of some 27 million tonnes/yr, based on PPI's Top 150 survey for 2001.

"Uncoated woodfree prices fall further in Europe","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, Aug. 21, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The European uncoated woodfree market remains quiet as the vacation period continues. But output curtailments have hit the headlines, as uncoated and coated woodfree producers kept taking downtime in the region during the second quarter.
Demand has not been anything to write home about this year, but the slack trend has been made worse by the mid-year vacation period when many offices are empty and order books thin. On top of the pressure to lower prices due to the lack of demand, suppliers have been faced with speculative buyers who are betting on uncoated woodfree paper prices falling further. As a result, buyers have been confining their purchases to minimum levels, replenishing stocks only when they need to.
Imports have perked up as those papermakers who have not been idling their machines have tried to find alternative markets for their products. One producer said large volumes of uncoated woodfree paper has been imported to Europe, especially from southeast Asia. Another supplier indicated that some Australian paper has found its way to the UK. 
Southern European papermakers have also reportedly been actively exporting to the Italian market. According to sources in Spain, the Spanish uncoated woodfree market is saturated due to overcapacity in the Iberian peninsula. 
Prices under pressure
The slack demand has pushed prices down in Europe over the vacation period, despite the heavy downtime taken. In the French market, prices for offset reels and sheets dropped by FF 100/tonne in June and by a further FF 100-300/tonne in July. One supplier said that business almost ground to a halt in July and that hefty discounts were available even on small orders. 
Germany has not escaped the price plunge either, with levels for offset sheets dropping DM 50/tonne at the top end of the range in June and DM 50/tonne at the bottom of the price band in July. Prices for offset reels dipped DM 100/tonne at the lower end in July. 
Italian levels for offset sheets and reels remained steady in June, but eroded by ITL 50/kg in July, while in the UK, both offset sheets and reels slid by Pounds 10/tonne in June and a further Pounds 10-20/tonne in July.
Cut-size crumbles
Copy paper managed to escape the price pressure on other uncoated woodfree grades for much of this year. But since June there have been signs that A4 is fallible, with levels starting to erode in almost all the major markets. 
Several players complained that Italy and Spain have been difficult markets, as some domestic producers have been running their machines flat out and selling as much as they can at low prices, benefiting from cheap spot pulp levels. Some suppliers to the Italian market said that the country's merchants have been aggressively trying to negotiate lower prices. 
Copy paper prices have slid by ITL 150/kg since April, and there have been reports of spot prices selling at ITL 200/kg below the market level. But one supplier was hopeful that the bottom has been reached and intends to try and raise prices by ITL 50/kg in September.
Cut-size levels remained steady in Germany. But in France, A4 prices have started to erode. Levels fell by FF 100/tonne at the bottom of the range in June and by another FF 100/tonne in July. 
In the UK, several industry insiders noted that the copy paper market has become more aggressive. Some suppliers reported that levels have been gradually eroding for the past couple of months, but others said they have not lowered their prices. On top of that, A4 from outside Europe, for example, from southeast Asia, is reportedly selling at up to Pounds 50/tonne below market levels.
But the outlook for the uncoated woodfree market is more positive for the rest of the year. Suppliers indicated that order books already look healthy for September, when activity traditionally perks up.

Just wanted to update you on the correlations. Luis did not have any high yield fibers prices that we talked about yesterday. The only thing available was the mixed paper prices which I tried to correlate to tissue but the correlation coefficient came at 15%.

Also, I spoke with Ryan Ogden at Bureau of Labor Stats and it didn't seem like they had the prices for those recycled products. In any case, I asked him to email me whatever they have in their website in terms of paper prices and I am expecting that email today. Hopefully smth good will come out of that.

Monika, 
As you may notice, I've changed from the FOEX office into my P?yry office. 

In addition to the material I already sent to you on PIX pulp indexes earlier today, please find attached an older presentation (from the time FOEX was still an Exchange and NBSKP was the only index-series launched) which may shed some more light into the issue. 

Best regards, 
Timo T.

"World market pulp inventories decline on stronger shipments","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined for the fourth month in a row, down 171,000 tonnes in June from the previous month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. The reduction is a 4.6 percent drop from May results, which followed a 4.3 percent drop the month prior.
World producer stocks closed June at 3.528 million tonnes or 74.8 percent higher than the same period one year ago. Producer inventory levels represented 39 days of supply in June, three days fewer than in May. That compares to year-ago results when world producers held 22 days of supply.
June production of 2.659 million tonnes was down 5.6 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.818 million tonnes, and dipped compared to last month. Meanwhile, Global shipments rose to the highest year-to-date close. World shipments totaled 2.830 million tonnes in June, down only 3 percent from year-ago results of 2,919 tonnes.
Producers operated at 88 percent of capacity in June, a 6 percent jump from May production but down 8 percent compared to the same time last year. The shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, jumped 7 points over the prior month to close June at 94 percent, PPPC reported.
World inventory figures include totals from North America, Nordic countries, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Swaziland. Countries that do not report inventories include Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand.

"Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats","We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

--  It is marked with the word ""Anthrax.""
--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as ""personal"" or ""confidential"".
--  Has a strange odor or stain.
--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.
--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. 
--  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
--  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
--  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.

"newsprint update, 11/27","Dear Team,

Advance Publications' The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., is struggling to find $10 million to slash from its budget because many of its key retail advertisers have filed for bankruptcy or cut their spending.  The Star-Ledger still promises to honor its famous handbook pledge not to lay off any of its nonunion employees due to a bad turn in the economy.  The Star-Ledger also canceled its Christmas party, has closed a small satellite office in Newark, is offering buyouts to selected employees, and will decrease the amounts of its annual raises and bonuses.  The Star-Ledger has a  410,547-weekday-circulation newspaper and about 132,449 MT in newsprint consumption.  The carnage continues as the loss of advertising dollars plagues newspapers.

"FOEX pulls down benchmark NBSK price to $478.91/tonne","paperloop.com
HELSINKI, July 17, 2001 (Reuters) - Finnish index compiler FOEX on Tuesday put the benchmark price of northern bleached softwood pulp at $478.91/tonne, down from last week's $490.85/tonne, and said the price of lightweight coated magazine (LWC) paper had also fallen. 
FOEX calculates the weekly benchmarks based on information from buyers, sellers and agents in the pulp and paper trade. It eliminates the highest and lowest 10 percent of prices, and calculates the indices as the average of the remaining prices.

"Cenibra/JBP Market Rumor","
Our internal intelligence group informed us that the following rumor is circulating in the Brazilian market:  JBP is considering putting the Cenibra assets (note that these are the assets they recently purchased from CVRD) up for sale.  They indicated that JBP was interested in improving the assets (they are currently implementing a debottlenecking project at Cenibra) and then selling them for cash flow reasons.  The strongest possible buyer at this point would be VCP as they're currently in a very strong financial position (low leverage and are part of the Votorantim conglomerate which throws off considerable cash from its cement and financial services businessnes).  Also look for the Scandinavians to possibly make a bid for the assets as they've expressed interest in obtaining eucalyptus assets in the past.  We can most likely discount Aracruz from the running as they're currently rumored to be an acquisition target themselves (most likely buyer would again be VCP as they recently purchased Mondi's stake in the company and presently holds a 28% share in Aracruz --- however, it's doubtful that VCP would be able to swallow Cenibra and Aracruz simultaneously).  What does this mean for the market?  Any purchase by VCP would make them the strongest eucalyptus pulp producer globally with over 2 million tons (estimated market pulp would be about 1.7 million tons) and give them considerable pricing power as they would represent roughly 30% of global market capacity for eucalyptus pulp.

Please note that this is a rumor at this point and should be viewed as such.  I'll keep you updated regarding any developments.

*	In September, many major market pulp producers announced px
increases of $20-$30, effective Oct. 1. One major hold-out was Weyerhaeuser.
At the time, we were skeptical of the success of a px increase for Oct.
based on current market conditions -- favoring a gradual, modest increase in
Nov and Dec.
*	This afternoon, WY announced that it was raising pulp pxs by $20 per
tonne in the U.S. to $500 from $480/tonne (effective November 1).  This move
would effectively put WY's pricing in-line with the higher October levels
attempted by other producers (which have not generally held, to our
understanding).
*	Consistent with our view, we do believe that global market pulp pxs
can rise modestly in November & December based on the fact that several
regions' producers are seeing realizations near-or-below cash-cost levels.  
*	We maintain our view that global market pulp pxs will rise gradually
(at a modest pace) throughout 2002, but average below 2001 levels (cont'd
below) 

OPINION
We also see much higher average pulp prices in 2003 and again in 2004 --
which we regard as the cyclical peak year. Our average NBSK price forecast
for Europe remains $540 per tonne in 2001; $510 per tonne in 2002; $595 per
tonne in 2003; and $695 per tonne in 2004. 
We note that Weyerhaeuser's action is for the U.S. market, which has
generally been roughly $30 per tonne higher in price level than Europe due
largely to the impact of the very strong US dollar vs European currencies.

Company mentioned: 

Weyerhaeuser (WY -- 1M -- $49.09)

Subject: Re: Foex Index; yr two e-mails


Hi Monika,

Welcome to the pulp and paper world.

In order to understand the index system, the first thing is to look at our
web-site www.foex.fi which includes a lot of information, particularly in
this case the FAQ section. You probably have taken a look at that already,
though.

Our two pulp indexes, NBSKP (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) and BHKP
(birch+eucalyptus) cover the European market. As abt 40% of the world pulp
trade is for the European market, these are, in a way, considered to be the
""world market prices"", particularly as the third biggest market, North
America (Asia is the second biggest) has virtually the same prices as
Europe; correlation between the two is well over 0.9.

The sellers reporting to us are, by definition, in NBSKP from Canada, US
West Coast and the Nordic countries. BHKP (birch, euca) sellers are from the
Nordic region, Latin America, Spain and Portugal and a number of
Asian/African companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market.
Buyers are European producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some
of their pulp from the open market, representing virtually all countires in
Western Europe. The split between birch and euca is approximately 30%/70%,
again reflecting the actual situation in the European market.

The exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received
from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some
are not. The producers reporting to us represent roughly 80% of the supply
to Europe in the two benchmark grades.

Most (=80-90%) of the pulp sold in Europe is so-called contract business.
This means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract
covering the grades and volumes, quantity rebates etc. However, prices are
fixed also for contract business on a monthly/quarterly basis. Most of the
pulp arriving Continental Europe or UK from abroad, goes through consignment
warehouses (in places like Antwerp, Rotterdam, La Pallice, Tilbury,
Savono-Livorno range etc.). As forwarding companies allow 30-60 days of free
storage, buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp,
delivered by sellers in large shipments, little be little by lorry, rail or
barge. Each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the
price reported to us, before customer specific rebates. Prices are for prime
grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following
month.

The following comments are worth making:
- Our system is based on first taking off top 10% and bottom 10% of the
prices received and only then calculating the index (or rather benchmark)
values. This way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well
as any theoretical attempts of manipulation (we have never detected any
attempts)
- We have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and
sellers. Some we receive through agents/merchants/trading houses - usually
mandated by a supplier to give us the price data
- If someone does not report their prices on a given week, we can use the
previous week's data but only once
- Prices are not volume-weighted (in order to avoid the manipulation
possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier
sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones)
- Prices are CIF European port before customer-specific rebates (again to
avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain
unchanged; also, rebates are often given only afterwards - e.g. when
exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold - and we cannot alter our indexes
retroactively)
- Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European
Community anti-trust regulators (=DG IV) and audited by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
- There is a group of independent experts, case need, as ""trouble shooters"".
Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the
index values.
- Participation is totally voluntary
- The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes
and Pulpex quotations include:
a) our prices are before customer-specific rebates (averaging 5-6%), Pulpex
prices are net
b) our prices are for contract business, Pulpex prices represent the lowest
spot-levels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market
c) our price info is based on actual sales, Pulpex prices are expectations
what the spot price might be in e.g. 3 month's time
d) our price is for a prime quality (within each benchmark grade there are
surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold) approved
by a seller from a particular supplier/mill, whilst Pulpex prices, based on
a delivery concept (i.e. you do not accept the price offered to close a
contract, you can make/take delivery), are prices in a particular inventory
location (3-4 alternative ones), sometimes far away from buyer's or seller's
normal ports for any lot (often unknown/unwanted grade, up to 11 months and
29 days old goods). This system tends to emphasize in the Pulpex system the
extreme prices, up or down, particularly in these early stages with low
liquidity.
- Our indexes are trade-marked products. Therefore their use for any
commercial purposes is possible only with our permission. To get that
permission, users pay us a small premium, the main source of our income.
Enron and FOEX Indexes Ltd. have a contract, Bob Crane has the details at
your end.

I trust this is helpful. I encourage you to contact us anew for any
additional questions.

Please find enclosed, for order's sake our pulp specs, some additional
comments we send to the price providers and the historical price series you
asked for (historical series are still without today's indexes, to be
published about an hour from sending this message; you can add those from
our web-site by the time you read this).

My best regards to you as well as to David and Elizabeth.

Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron
Industrial Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and
Elizabeth Hutchinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works.
Right now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX
index and the methodology behind it. I have seen one of the
presentations that you have presented in the States a while ago but I am
looking for a little bit more detail. For example, what kind of
companies you contact, what percentage of industry they represent in
terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, what geographic area
these companies represent and anything else that you think its important
to know.

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli

Monika,
 
It would appear that paperloop.com is now publishing spot pulp prices for NBSK and SBSK.  It wasn't clear from the description how they were compiling/obtaining the information to publish this pricing.  It'd be interesting to see how these prices compare with the prompt contract price for pulp on the Pulpex.  Any chance you could check this out for me tomorrow?  Thanks.

"Pulp Consumer Inventory Monitoring","
Andrew,

The following is a follow-up to our conversation yesterday regarding implementation of a monitoring process for North American consumer pulp inventories.  As it wouldn't be cost-effective to monitor all consumers, I thought we should define a sample that would be most representative of the total consumer inventory picture.  Accordingly, as 70% of all North American market pulp is consumed by uncoated freesheet, tissue, and newsprint producers I believe covering the largest producers in these segments would suffice.  I've identified these producers as follows:

Newsprint - the listed three represent approximately 66% of market pulp consumption by newsprint

Abitibi (5,783,000 tons)
Bowater (3,692,000 tons)
Kruger (1,084,000 tons)
  
Uncoated Freesheet - the listed four represent approx. 63% of market pulp consumption by UCFS.  Note that the next two largest producers are Weyerhaeuser and Willamette, with 9% market share each.  I suggest we monitor GP as we'll already be doing so as part of the tissue segment (see below).  Additionally, if Weyerhaeuser is successful in its bid for Willamette, we may be able to increase total coverage to 81% by adding only one more company.  I'd suggest we wait for an outcome before making a decision. 

International Paper (4,578,000 tons)
Domtar (2,309,000 tons)
Boise Cascade (1,579,000 tons)
Georgia Pacific (1,349,000 tons)

Tissue - the listed three represent 68% of market pulp consumption by Tissue.  The remainder of the market is highly fragmented.

Georgia Pacific (2,721,000 tons)
Kimberly Clark (1,330,000 tons)
Procter & Gamble (1,110,000 tons)

If you could provide your feedback by the end of this week, I can begin discussing the feasibility of this with Competitive Intelligence.  Thanks.

KC

"World market pulp inventories decline for fifth consecutive month","SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 34,000 in July from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. The reduction is a 1 percent drop from June levels, and marked the fifth month in a row that world inventories have dropped. 
World producer stocks closed July at 3.494 million tonnes, representing 38 days of supply, one day fewer than June results. Producer inventory levels are 54.7 percent higher than year-ago results, significantly better than the prior month's year-over-year 74.8 percent rise. In July of last year, world producers held 24 days of supply. 
July production of 2.747 million tonnes rose vs. last month but declined 12.1 percent compared to the same period last year when producers churned out 3.124 million tonnes. Global shipments dipped only slightly from the prior month's year-to-date high. World shipments totaled 2.791 million tonnes in July, down 3.1 percent from year-ago results of 2.883 tonnes. 
Producers operated at 88 percent of capacity in July. The operating rate mirrored June results but was down substantially vs. the 103 percent operating rate of the same time last year. The shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, dropped 5 points from the prior month to 88 percent, PPPC reported. 
World inventory figures include totals from North America, Nordic countries, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Swaziland. Countries that do not report inventories include Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Hi Monika,

Welcome to the pulp and paper world.

In order to understand the index system, the first thing is to look at our
web-site www.foex.fi which includes a lot of information, particularly in
this case the FAQ section. You probably have taken a look at that already,
though.

Our two pulp indexes, NBSKP (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) and BHKP
(birch+eucalyptus) cover the European market. As abt 40% of the world pulp
trade is for the European market, these are, in a way, considered to be the
""world market prices"", particularly as the third biggest market, North
America (Asia is the second biggest) has virtually the same prices as
Europe; correlation between the two is well over 0.9.

The sellers reporting to us are, by definition, in NBSKP from Canada, US
West Coast and the Nordic countries. BHKP (birch, euca) sellers are from the
Nordic region, Latin America, Spain and Portugal and a number of
Asian/African companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market.
Buyers are European producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some
of their pulp from the open market, representing virtually all countires in
Western Europe. The split between birch and euca is approximately 30%/70%,
again reflecting the actual situation in the European market.

The exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received
from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some
are not. The producers reporting to us represent roughly 80% of the supply
to Europe in the two benchmark grades.

Most (=80-90%) of the pulp sold in Europe is so-called contract business.
This means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract
covering the grades and volumes, quantity rebates etc. However, prices are
fixed also for contract business on a monthly/quarterly basis. Most of the
pulp arriving Continental Europe or UK from abroad, goes through consignment
warehouses (in places like Antwerp, Rotterdam, La Pallice, Tilbury,
Savono-Livorno range etc.). As forwarding companies allow 30-60 days of free
storage, buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp,
delivered by sellers in large shipments, little be little by lorry, rail or
barge. Each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the
price reported to us, before customer specific rebates. Prices are for prime
grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following
month.

The following comments are worth making:
- Our system is based on first taking off top 10% and bottom 10% of the
prices received and only then calculating the index (or rather benchmark)
values. This way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well
as any theoretical attempts of manipulation (we have never detected any
attempts)
- We have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and
sellers. Some we receive through agents/merchants/trading houses - usually
mandated by a supplier to give us the price data
- If someone does not report their prices on a given week, we can use the
previous week's data but only once
- Prices are not volume-weighted (in order to avoid the manipulation
possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier
sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones)
- Prices are CIF European port before customer-specific rebates (again to
avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain
unchanged; also, rebates are often given only afterwards - e.g. when
exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold - and we cannot alter our indexes
retroactively)
- Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European
Community anti-trust regulators (=DG IV) and audited by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
- There is a group of independent experts, case need, as ""trouble shooters"".
Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the
index values.
- Participation is totally voluntary
- The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes
and Pulpex quotations include:
a) our prices are before customer-specific rebates (averaging 5-6%), Pulpex
prices are net
b) our prices are for contract business, Pulpex prices represent the lowest
spot-levels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market
c) our price info is based on actual sales, Pulpex prices are expectations
what the spot price might be in e.g. 3 month's time
d) our price is for a prime quality (within each benchmark grade there are
surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold) approved
by a seller from a particular supplier/mill, whilst Pulpex prices, based on
a delivery concept (i.e. you do not accept the price offered to close a
contract, you can make/take delivery), are prices in a particular inventory
location (3-4 alternative ones), sometimes far away from buyer's or seller's
normal ports for any lot (often unknown/unwanted grade, up to 11 months and
29 days old goods). This system tends to emphasize in the Pulpex system the
extreme prices, up or down, particularly in these early stages with low
liquidity.
- Our indexes are trade-marked products. Therefore their use for any
commercial purposes is possible only with our permission. To get that
permission, users pay us a small premium, the main source of our income.
Enron and FOEX Indexes Ltd. have a contract, Bob Crane has the details at
your end.

I trust this is helpful. I encourage you to contact us anew for any
additional questions.

Please find enclosed, for order's sake our pulp specs, some additional
comments we send to the price providers and the historical price series you
asked for (historical series are still without today's indexes, to be
published about an hour from sending this message; you can add those from
our web-site by the time you read this).

My best regards to you as well as to David and Elizabeth.

Timo Teras

Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron
Industrial Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and
Elizabeth Hutchinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works.
Right now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX
index and the methodology behind it. I have seen one of the
presentations that you have presented in the States a while ago but I am
looking for a little bit more detail. For example, what kind of
companies you contact, what percentage of industry they represent in
terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, what geographic area
these companies represent and anything else that you think its important
to know.

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli

"IP second half pulp downtime plan follows 80,000 tonnes in second quarter","forestweb.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 17, 2001 (Forestweb) - International Paper Co. (IP) took 80,000 tonnes of market pulp downtime in the second quarter and is likely to take the same amount in both the third and fourth quarters, the company said today. 
IP executive vice president and chief financial officer John Faraci made the comments in the company's conference call today, in connection with the release of second quarter results showing a $313 million net loss. 
An IP spokesman said there were no further details. 
The second-half plan would be about the same rate of market downtime the company has taken since the beginning of the year. 
Last month an informed source said that from January through April, the company had taken 130,000 tonnes of total pulp downtime, including 25,000 tonnes for maintenance. 
That would average 26,250 tonnes per month of market-related downtime for the first four months of the year, about the same as the 26,700 tonnes per month average for 80,000 tonnes per quarter. 
""IP is doing what it needs to do, with prices what they are,"" said a Canadian pulp and paper industry consultant who heard the conference call.

Hello Mr. Cose,

I have found some information on harwood Pulp and BEK. So far I only have production, and capacity numbers for each country as well as some forecast that RISI has done on the hardwood.
I am still waiting to get some demand data from RISI and I expect that to come next week. 
In addition, I have a powerpoint presentation on BEK and I can send that one over to you as well.
Do you want to have this information now or do you want to wait until I get the demand data? Also, is better for you to have these faxed or by mail.

let me know,

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

As we're still in the process of refining our Brazil data, we hope to eventually start publishing some proprietary information on operating rates, FOB cash costs, and prices obtained by individual companies in various geographic regions.  Assuming, that is, our in-house resource is able to obtain this type of information.  
 
We hope that this newsletter will provide information for discussion purposes, and anyone requiring anything further can please feel free to contact those individuals from Fundamentals listed in the report.

"North American 3Q pulp downtime dwarfs earlier curtailments","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Various major market pulp producers have further increased their downtime plans -- scheduling an estimated 767,402 tonnes during the third quarter -- in a more aggressive attempt to bring inventories in line with expected demand. 
Many of the supply curtailments are taking place during the summer as producers anticipate continued weak pricing. 
The 767,402 tonnes producers are taking this quarter represent the most downtime producers have taken in the past fiscal year, and already has eclipsed the estimated 655,132 tonnes producers took in the second quarter. The total also dwarfed the 383,000 tonnes taken in the first quarter, when cold weather prevented some producers from shutting operations, and has surpassed the 512,000 tonnes taken in fourth-quarter 2000, when several producers combined maintenance and market-related shuts. Current downtime is primarily market related, say industry sources. 
Tembec, Inc., which has about 426,000 tonnes of yearly northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) capacity, will lose about 20,119 tonnes from its NBSK mill in Skookumchuck, B.C., while its other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will trim about 16,926 tonnes based on c capacity of 191,000 tonnes/yr. Tembec's NBSK downtime alone will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of the 100,000 tonnes of 3Q downtime it has planned. The remaining 62,595 tonnes will come from its various bleached chemi-thermomechanical (BCTMP) mills and some specialty sulfite pulps. 
A source at Parsons & Whittemore today said the Rye Brook, N.Y., firm would shutter its northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) mill in Nackawick, N.B., from Aug. 20 to Sept. 8. The mill, which has capacity to produce 260,000 tonnes/yr, will curb about 14,060 tonnes from its supplies. All of the downtime is market-related, said the source. 
Meanwhile, International Paper Co. said during a conference call last week that its third-quarter pulp curtailments would total about 80,000 tonnes, equaling the downtime it had taken in the second quarter. That downtime is in addition to huge cutbacks of a combined 147,000 tonnes per quarter it has taken since shutting down its integrated pulp mills in Mobile, Ala., and Camden, Ark. 
Canfor Corp. last week said it would close its Northwood mill in Prince George, B.C., from July 27-Aug. 6 and lose about 19,000 tonnes of NBSK. A company source said the mill would again close in September, with its two pulp lines shut for about 10 days each, losing another 15,000 tonnes and bringing the company's third-quarter NBSK downtime to 34,000 tonnes, according to the source. 
Valois Vision Marketing reported last week that UPM-Kymmene has taken about 12,000 tonnes of NBSK from supplies at its Miramichi, N.B., mill in July. Further third-quarter downtime plans at the firm were not available. 
""Look at the prices, I'm surprised there isn't more downtime,"" said Managing Director Michel Valois, who expected that paper downtime would continue at a high rate. That could fuel additional market pulp downtime moving forward, he noted.

"Indonesian market pulp slips out of the European picture","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, July 26, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Financial and logistical problems as well as unattractive prices have diminished Europe's attractiveness as a market for Indonesian hardwood pulp suppliers, who were blamed for the dramatic fall in hardwood pulp prices. 
On top of that, reported action in Italy by an environmental group against a paper producer said to be buying Indonesian pulp is another factor that may have stemmed the flow of Indonesian hardwood to the region. 
While the action was said to be ""nothing new"" by one importer of Indonesian pulp, he conceded that buyers were asking more questions about the timber source for these products in the wake of the campaign. Another supplier added, ""This means that certain customers will not use Indonesian pulps anymore.""
Separately, the environmental group Friends of the Earth has mounted a high profile campaign in the UK against the use of non-plantation hardwood in papermaking.
Prices near bottom
Market pulp prices remain hard to pin down. As one buyer put it, ""All the numbers are low and all the numbers are fluid."" Eucalyptus pricing is particularly elusive as more deals which are a mixture of regular and spot business emerge. As gross prices for regular business net down to something very similar to spot offers, there is a genuine reason to believe that the bottom has been reached for this grade.
Northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) prices slipped gently between FOEX's July 17 figure of $478.91/tonne and $477.27/tonne on July 24, although most buyers agree, and sellers concede, that new deals for regular business are likely to be done at $460/tonne. Spot prices for NBSK are even lower at a price below which many North American producers fail to break even. Downtime was insufficient to prevent these break-even levels from being reached. There is little room for spot prices to fall further.
More downtime can be expected in the Norscan countries as a result of such weak prices. Norske Skog Canada has announced a further 14,000 tonnes of market pulp downtime, which brings the company's third quarter market pulp curtailment up to 28,000 tonnes.
If inventories remain static for the next two months, during a period when they traditionally rise, and then fall during the fourth quarter, this would set the scene for prices to creep up again in the first quarter next year or even before. A strong dollar and poor worldwide economic performance will hamper any rapid change in the pulp market's fortunes though.
Evidence that the market is approaching a period of price stability is mounting. One supplier reported, ""We have already had some requests from customers to price pulp for July and August, which is an indication that they think we have reached the bottom.""
Pulp consumption in June dropped by more than 5 percent compared to May, according to UTIPULP figures. The participating countries reported consumption of 1,044,359 tonnes in June, which left stocks virtually unchanged at 1,046,052 tonnes. This equates to some 28 days' worth of pulp.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Norscan pulp stocks rose 4,000 tonnes in July","paperloop.com
HELSINKI, Aug 14, 2001 (Reuters) _ Producers' pulp stocks in Finland, Sweden, the United States and Canada rose 4,000 tonnes to just over 1.78 million tonnes in July, increasing less than the long_term average for the month, a Finnish industry official said on Tuesday. 
Stocks of market pulp in the North American and Scandinavian (Norscan) countries rose in three out of the four producer countries, but a 36,000 tonne drop in Canadian stocks to 790,000 tonnes helped keep the end_July level almost flat on end_June. 
""Inventories were practically unchanged,"" said Mikko Tahvanainen of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation. ""Things went better than expected."" 
The 10_year average increase for July is between 150,000 and 160,000 tonnes he said. 
Market pulp stocks are an indicator of future trends in prices of the key raw material, which in turn affect paper prices. High pulp inventories indicate downward pressure and low stocks upside for prices. 
Persistently high stocks and low demand this year have put pulp prices under pressure, and the benchmark price for northern bleached softwood pulp has fallen 36 percent this year to below $460 per tonne. 
Pulp stocks in Finland rose 15,000 tonnes by the end of July from end_June to 100,000 tonnes, while Swedish pulp inventories rose 13,000 tonnes to 380,000 tonnes, Tahvanainen said. 
U.S. producers' pulp stocks rose 12,000 tonnes in July to 514,000 tonnes, he said. 
The end_July stocks level of 1,784,000 tonnes amounted to 27 days' of output, unchanged on June, he said. 
Norscan producers' pulp shipments rose by 5,000 tonnes in July to 1,742,000 tonnes, he said. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the world's biggest market pulp producer, Sodra of Sweden, posted a 53 percent drop in first_half profits to 443 million Swedish crowns ($43.11 million) due to weak pulp prices but said it saw prices bottoming out. 
But Sodra also said the global economic slowdown would also reduce demand in the second half of the year, which could involve continued capacity curtailments in the paper and pulp industry during the autumn.

PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 16, 2001 (press release) -- Pope & Talbot, Inc. announced today that the Company lost $9.1 million, or $.59 per share, in the third quarter of 2001. $6.3 million ($10.2 million pre-tax), or $.41 per share, resulted from an accrual for import duties on lumber shipped from Canada into the U.S. from May 19, 2001 through the end of the third quarter (see Wood Products discussion). The loss prior to import duties, was $2.8 million, or $.18 per share. For the same period a year ago, the Company earned $9.3 million, or $.64 per diluted share. Revenues were $142.3 million for the quarter, nearly flat with the third quarter of 2000. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) excluding corporate costs and before lumber import duties were $8.9 million. After subtracting the non-cash accrual for duties, EBITDA fell to a negative $1.2 million versus a positive $28.5 million in the third quarter of 2000....

"European spot pulp prices see improvement","BRUSSELS, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The lowest spot prices have all but disappeared from the European market, although there is little buying activity at all as the vacation season shifts from northern to southern Europe. Unsolicited spot offers are a reducing feature of European pulp buyers' lives.
Pulpex futures prices have crept up in the past two weeks. When Pulpex prices move away from spot prices, this tends to indicate the direction to be expected for spot price movement. Certain short fiber producers from South America are reported to have abandoned the Italian market temporarily as price demands in the country have hit lows that these suppliers are not prepared to entertain.

"U.S. pulp spot market prices decline","paperloop.com
In U.S. East spot markets, northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp prices declined just over a percent while hardwood spot transactions took a larger fall since July 2. Traders said that although some suppliers had pulled out of spot business, availability of various grades was still plentiful.
Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest dipped $5/tonne to $420-$450/tonne, or 13 percent below July contract prices, paperloop sources said. Southern bleached softwood kraft (SBSK) on the spot market also fell, down $5/tonne to $400-$430/tonne.
""Prices are still eroding in the States (because) a lot of spot is still available, it's all over the place,"" said a supplier source. But he added that spot prices had eroded so badly in Asian markets that he pulled out altogether. Previously, some suppliers had diverted tonnage to Asian markets because of stronger demand for hardwoods there.
Both hardwood grades fell in the U.S. by $10/tonne on oversupply as producers tried to edge down their inventories. Northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) closed the week about 18 percent below July contract prices at $340-380/tonne. Southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) also ended at $340-380/tonne, but the lower end prices were partly keyed by low freight costs. One source noted that in the Northeast some buys were in ""the low 300s.""
""We have a ton of hardwood (available),"" said a Midwest buyer source who indicated he was recently offered about 2,000 tonnes of spot NBHK at $360.

Two things:

2) Please give me a short (2-3 bullet) summary of what you are doing on pricing and inventory forecasting. I want to develop a summary report for Bob Crane.

"Morgan Stanley forecasts pulp prices will fall to $460/tonne in 3Q","paperloop.com
HELSINKI, July 13, 2001 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said on Friday that it saw pulp prices bottoming out at $460 per tonne in the third quarter -- six percent below current levels -- and lowered its pulp forecasts through the end of 2003.
The investment bank said that $460 was the cash cost of producing for the highest-cost producers, so it should represent the very bottom of pricing in the current cycle.
But MSDW said in its morning preview note that it was not lowering its earnings forecasts for the major European paper producers as the integrated manufacturers have little or no exposure to prices of market pulp.
The major European producers include the world's second biggest papermaker Stora Enso and third biggest UPM-Kymmene, Finnish M-real, Norwegian Norske Skog and the European operations of South African Sappi.
""It would take lower paper price forecasts for us to reduce our earnings estimates,"" MSDW said. ""So far, aggressive producer downtime has kept paper prices from collapsing, however, we do expect second-quarter results to be down from the first quarter and the risks to our estimates for the full-year 2001 remain to the downside.""
Prices of long-fibre pulp have dropped 31 percent this year, to current levels around $491 per tonne as the global economy has cooled and manufacturers of fine paper have sharply curbed output to take up slack in global demand.
But paper prices, which usually follow pulp prices, have held up better than in previous downturns. The European papermakers' second-quarter earnings reporting season will start with Stora Enso's report on July 26.

"Mead/Westvaco merger sets the pace for further deals","NEW YORK, Aug. 29, 2001 (Reuters) - The merger announced on Wednesday between paper producers Mead Corp and Westvaco Corp reminded investors that the consolidation of the fragmented global forest products industry is far from over and the focus will soon switch to other potential targets, analysts said.
The $3 billion stock-swap deal, which will create North America's No 4 paper company, follows a series of substantial takeovers in the forest products industry in the past few years. Yet still, the top five global players -- International Paper Co, Georgia-Pacific Corp, Weyerhaeuser Co, Kimberly-Clark Corp, and Stora Enso -- accounted for only an estimated 30% of the industry's sales last year, leaving much room for more marriages. By comparison, the top five players in the automobile or chemical industries control about 50% of their markets.
""This industry is not finished yet -- they are going to come in the next couple of years,"" Mark Connelly, analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said of further mergers among paper companies. While unlikely, some analysts said that Mead or Westvaco could attract counteroffers from anyone willing to pay even a slight premium to terms unveiled on Wednesday.
Recent consolidation in the industry has been spearheaded by European companies, as they tend to think more globally, he said. Big deals by European papermakers include Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso's acquisition of Wisconsin-based Consolidated Paper and Finnish papermaker UPM-Kymmene's purchase of four mills from German magazine paper maker Haindl.
Not just the Europeans
North American players have also been active on the acquisition front in recent years. In the last two years, International Paper bought Union Camp for $5 billion, Stone Container Corp of the US merged with the US unit of Jefferson Smurfit Group of Ireland and Weyerhaeuser Co bought Macmillan.
In Canada, Abitibi-Consolidated Inc joined hands with Norske Skogindustrier AS of Norway and Hansol Paper of South Korea to set up an Asian newsprint company in a $1.4 billion alliance. ""Consolidation will continue to be global -- there is a whole lot more that needs to happen both here and in Europe,"" said Connelly.
Although the rate of consolidation has picked up in recent years, deals among the industry's main players may not pick up pace any time soon as giants such as IP, which acquired Champion International last year, digest their new holdings and streamline their businesses.
Low pulp prices, weak export markets due to the strong dollar, and slowing demand related to the softened US economy have made this process more difficult than previously envisaged. ""It's like the tiger is digesting -- once he's finished digesting he's going to go on the hunt again,"" said Joshua Zaret, an analyst with ABN Amro. ""Likely acquirers have other agendas right now."" The big players may return to the acquisition trail within the next 12 to 18 months, Zaret said.
Companies with assets in Latin America are likely to be one target. A recent Standard & Poor's study of the forest products industry showed that the more profitable European companies now prefer investing in South America rather than pumping money into US assets, which have been hit by the strong dollar and increasing cost of energy.
Shares of several companies often pinpointed as potential acquisition targets rose on Wednesday on news of the Mead and Westvaco merger, including office and wood products maker Boise Cascade Corp and No 2 North American newsprint producer Bowater Inc.
""You will see a handful of players in each of the major grades,"" said Zaret when asked what the paper products industry will look like three years from now. ""I think where we are we are well advanced with more to come.""

Please find attached the first version of a Brazil Market Wrap which we envision issuing bi-weekly.  The intent is to provide you with a general overview of the currency's value and the prevailing economic environment in Brazil, as well as information relevant to the pulp market. 
 
As we're still in the process of refining our Brazil data, we hope to eventually start publishing some proprietary information on operating rates, FOB cash costs, and prices obtained by individual companies in various geographic regions.  Assuming, that is, our in-house resource is able to obtain this type of information.  
 
We hope that this newsletter will provide information for discussion purposes, and anyone requiring anything further can please feel free to contact those individuals from Fundamentals listed in the report.  If you don't wish to receive this, then please kindly advise me and I will remove you from our distribution list.  Thanks.

Great to hv you onboard. I have already seen all the postings on the Fundy website but nothing new. All I need is some other pulp presentations done for other companies. I just need to follow the format and use some of the slides to modify. 

I need some information on Phoenix Pulp regard their new increase in capacity. They are having some expansion plan in their mill. Their capacity will increase by another 220,000mt in the year 2003/4. Please help me check it out. Please find out what kind of pulp will they be producing in this new capacity.

Thanks

You can go to the EIM fundies website under companies and there is some info there about Advance Agro Public, I am not sure about Phoenix Pulp though. 

Also, if this info is not what you want can you be more specific as to exactly what you want reported on these two companies?

let me know if this helps,
thanks
Monika Causholli

"Schweitzer-Mauduit to exit printing,writing paper in Brazil","forestweb.com
ALPHARETTA, Ga., July 16, 2001 (press release) -- Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (NYSE: SWM - news) today announced a plan to restructure its Brazilian operations and exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in Brazil in response to current business conditions. A pre-tax charge of approximately $4.5 to $5.0 million will be taken in the second quarter of 2001 to implement this restructuring. Excluding this unusual item, the Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2001 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Second quarter diluted earnings per share in 2000 were $.41. 
Brazilian Restructuring 
Wayne H. Deitrich, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, commented that, ``Recent changes in Brazilian business conditions made it necessary for Schweitzer-Mauduit to reassess its ability to continue to compete effectively in the printing and writing uncoated papers market. Sales volumes during the past six months have been unfavorably impacted by a slowdown in the Brazilian printing and writing papers market as well as by a decision by the Company to reduce its sales of certain grades of these papers that have been negatively impacted by ICMS, a form of value-added business tax. In addition, the recently enacted electricity rationing program in Brazil has necessitated production curtailments in our Brazilian operations. The printing and writing uncoated papers business is our least profitable product line in Brazil while being our largest electricity user.'' 
The decision to exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in Brazil will result in a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of 2001 of approximately $4.5 to $5.0 million, or $.20 to $.22 per share, for a non-cash write-off of assets. In addition, a further pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 to $0.7 million, or $.02 to $.03 per share, will be taken in the third quarter, primarily related to employee termination and severance costs. Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil's net sales of printing and writing uncoated papers totaled approximately $25 million in 2000. Because of cost reduction steps to be implemented as part of the restructuring, exiting the printing and writing uncoated papers business is not expected to have a material impact on ongoing operating results after the restructuring is fully implemented, which should occur by year-end 2001. 
Brazilian Energy Situation 
In late May, the Brazilian government announced the details of its electricity rationing program which has an overall objective of a 20 percent reduction in electricity consumption and mandates a 25 percent reduction in electricity consumption by the paper industry in the most populated and industrialized regions of Brazil. The reduction is calculated from prior-year average electricity consumption. The reduction must be measured and achieved for consecutive thirty-day periods commencing May 31, 2001. Failure to achieve the mandated reductions would result in higher electricity rates and cuts in electrical power service. The duration of the government's energy reduction directive is uncertain although it is expected to last at least six months, through the traditional ``dry period'' in Brazil. The government's forced consumption reduction program is in response to unusually low water levels in the lakes and reservoirs supplying Brazil's hydroelectric facilities that provide 90 percent of that country's electricity. 
In response to the Brazilian government's energy reduction directive, Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil implemented a four-part electricity reduction program. All nonessential nonmanufacturing uses of electricity are being eliminated including cuts in air conditioning, reduced lighting and changes in the operation of the water and effluent treatment plants. Manufacturing process modifications are being implemented to achieve more energy-efficient usage of equipment where product quality will not be compromised. A comprehensive energy conservation training program is being conducted for Brazilian employees and contracted service providers of the Company to increase awareness and solicit ideas for additional electricity reduction. To achieve the 25 percent electrical consumption reduction target, it has also been necessary to implement production curtailments. Machine downtime has been taken to reduce the production of the Company's least profitable products. 
Mr. Deitrich added that, ``Schweitzer-Mauduit does not expect the government's electricity reduction program to significantly affect the demand for or its ability to produce tobacco-related papers. Likewise, the availability of the Company's major raw materials such as wood pulp, chemicals and chalk and the ability to receive raw materials and ship finished product are not expected to be materially impacted. Exiting the printing and writing uncoated papers business will permit Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil to better focus on and service its other product lines.'' 
Anticipated Second Quarter Results 
Excluding the unusual charge associated with restructuring the Brazilian operations, the Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2001 to be in the range of $.52 to $.54 per share. Operating profit improvement is anticipated in both the French and U.S. business units compared with the prior-year quarter. Results for the quarter are expected to benefit from increased tobacco-related papers sales volumes, lower wood pulp costs and improvement in average selling prices. The average per ton list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp in the United States was $570 per metric ton in the second quarter of 2001 compared with $680 per metric ton in the second quarter of 2000. These positive factors will be partially offset by higher purchased energy costs and expenses related to the banded cigarette paper project and resultant higher cost of operations at the Spotswood, New Jersey mill. 
Schweitzer-Mauduit will issue its second quarter 2001 earnings press release on Thursday, July 26, 2001. The Company will hold a conference call to review second quarter results with investors and analysts at 10:30 a.m. eastern time on that day. The conference call will be simultaneously broadcast over the World Wide Web at http://www.schweitzer-mauduit.com . To listen to the call, please go to the Web site at least fifteen minutes prior to the call to register and download and install any necessary audio software. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available on the Web site shortly after the call. 
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. is a diversified producer of premium specialty papers and the world's largest supplier of fine papers to the tobacco industry. It also manufactures specialty papers for use in alkaline batteries, vacuum cleaner bags, overlay products, business forms and printing and packaging applications. Schweitzer-Mauduit and its subsidiaries conduct business in over 90 countries and employ 3,500 people worldwide, with operations in the United States, France, Brazil and Canada.

"newsprint morning update, 10/19","Good Morning Team,

Tribune Co. reported a net loss of $139 million for 3Q01, citing an advertising falloff, an expensive restructuring, and costs of news coverage in the wake of the September attacks.  The Chicago-based company, which owns 11 newspapers, 22 television stations, and more than 50 Web sites, had cut 6% to 7% of its work force because of the advertising slump. The attacks increased spending in the form of extra newspaper editions, extended coverage by its TV and radio stations, and increased capacity by its Web sites.  Revenue from publishing -- largely newspapers -- declined 8%  and retail advertising was down 7%.  For the first 9 months, the company had a net loss of $15.7 million, compared with year-earlier earnings of $168 million.  The trend continues as major media companies report their 3Q01 results...
Stay tuned for the market wrap this afternoon.

"Printing/writing producers increase June output, continue reducing inventory","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 8, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American printing and writing paper production dropped 301,000 tonnes in June compared with production for June of 2000, and producers operated at just 84 percent of capacity for June, according to the Pulp and Paper Products Council (PPPC).
Along with the decreased production compared with last year, overall printing and writing paper inventories decreased by 68,000 tonnes in June from May's level, and was down 152,000 tonnes compared with the June 2000 inventory total. Most of that stock decline was at uncoated free-sheet mills, primarily due to downtime. Coated free-sheet paper inventories remained relatively unaffected, dropping only 4,000 tonnes in June. Total coated free-sheet demand plummeted 21 percent in June compared with year-ago results.
Less downtime in June. While overall printing and writing paper operating rates were down to 84 percent in June in North America, less downtime was taken in June compared with May, when printing and writing papers' operating rate was only 79 percent.
The increased production in June was dependent upon an anticipated swell in demand. Production of lightweight coated (LWC) and coated groundwood usually pick up in the third quarter with demand from the catalog market. In addition, the seasonal swell in demand for uncoated free-sheet (especially reprographic paper for school and office use) begins in August, when large accounts begin their bids. 
The decrease in production of coated free-sheet and coated groundwood paper has helped save North American manufacturers in a weak market. But overall lack of domestic demand, a strong U.S. dollar impeding export, and less expensive imported coated papers has contributed to the sliding prices of coated papers in the U.S. since April.
With magazine subscriptions low and magazine pages down by 20 percent largely due to a decrease in advertising, the coated paper producers said they hope that the start of the holiday catalog season will stimulate sales.
Import competition. According to the PPPC, overseas imports of coated groundwood to North America dipped 13 percent when compared with June 2000 imports. Even though quantity has fallen, domestic manufacturers are having a hard time competing with less expensive Asian and European coated paper.
Uncoated free-sheet witnessed a rush of overseas imports in June, up 67.1 percent compared with June 2000. Overall, however, uncoated free-sheet shipments to the U.S. and Canada fell 74,000 tonnes (6 percent) compared with June 2000 shipments. 
The U.S. was aggressively exporting coated free-sheet to Canada through May this year. The U.S. shipped 128,900 tons in the first five months to Canada, up from 92,500 tons in the first five months of 2000, according to AF&PA. 
Inventory decline. Total inventories of printing and writing papers are tightening. Coated inventories remain high, however. In May, coated paper and coated groundwood inventory combined was at 820,000 tonnes, just 5,000 tonnes less than the inventory in June 2000. 
Inventories of uncoated free-sheet and uncoated groundwood papers slid steadily throughout the second quarter, totaling 1.682 million tonnes in June compared with 1.83 million tonnes in inventory in June 2000. 
Canadian mill shipments fell as much as 16.4 percent since last June for coated groundwood, according to the PPPC. Coated free-sheet shipments from Canada also fell 10.7 percent, reflecting a very loose North American market for coated paper overall. 
However, Canadian shipments of uncoated groundwood remained solid. Overall printing and writing paper shipments from Canada totaled 3.3 million tons in the first half of this year, down 4.2 percent compared with first half 2000 shipments.

"Neusiedler splashes out on SCP Ruzomberok in Slovakia","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, July 25, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Neusiedler has started a series of major investments at its Slovakian subsidiary SCP Ruzomberok to boost pulp and paper production. 
The revamps are slated for completion by January 2002 and will boost the site's production of bleached pulp. Output will rise from the 227,000 air dried (ad) tonnes produced in 2000 to 250,000 ad tonnes by the end of 2001. The company expects this to increase by a further 10,000 ad tonnes in 2002.
An upgrade of the plant's PM 8 is slated for 2002, but no details are available as yet. Neusiedler acquired its 50 percent stake in Severoslovenske Celulozky a Papierne (SCP) last year, changing the company's name to Neusiedler SCP Ruzomberok in October 2000.

Subject:	RISI pulp price methodology

July 23, 2001

Dick, I know Elizabeth gave you a copy of a fax RISI sent her about their pulp price methodology. To supplement that fax I called Rod Young and he gave me the following information.

Over the course of the year they talk to about 30 buyers and 30 producers for their U.S. NBSK price (Table 5). This list represents about 80% of the sell side and 75% of the buy side.
However, in a given month their sample is much smaller. In a typical month they talk to 5-10 buyers and 5-10 suppliers, who probably represent 20-25% of the buy and sell side. However, Rod said if they get exactly the same price from the first three buyers and the first three sellers, they stop their interviewing at that time and use that price.
Their call list covers a variety of sizes of buyer and seller, from very large to very small. I couldn't get more details.
Regionally they talk to producers from all major regions including West, Canada and the South. They talk to buyers from all regions but the emphasis is on the northern and central U.S., where the largest focus of consumption is located. They believe their sample is reasonably well balanced according to where production and consumption take place.

Monika will be speaking to Timo Teras at FOEX to as similar questions about their methodology.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks,

Dave

Stacy,

Do you remember when I asked you to find some info on Phoenix Pulp and Advance Agro Public Company. I told David Ho to look over the EIM website but he didn't find anything helpful there. Below is what David Ho needs exactly. Can you help me with this task? Also I realize that we do not have any ready available presentations so I am going to tell that to David.

thanks,
Monika

Hi Monika,

Great to hv you onboard. I have already seen all the postings on the Fundy website but nothing new. All I need is some other pulp presentations done for other companies. I just need to follow the format and use some of the slides to modify. 

I need some information on Phoenix Pulp regard their new increase in capacity. They are having some expansion plan in their mill. Their capacity will increase by another 220,000mt in the year 2003/4. Please help me check it out. Please find out what kind of pulp will they be producing in this new capacity.

Thanks
David

David,

I am replacing  Dimitri as the pulp analyst so in the future send the requests to me.

First, we do not have any readily available presentations on any of those two companies.
You can go to the EIM fundies website under companies and there is some info there about Advance Agro Public, I am not sure about Phoenix Pulp though. 

Also, if this info is not what you want can you be more specific as to exactly what you want reported on these two companies?

let me know if this helps,
thanks
Monika Causholli

Andrea,

I found a private consultant on tissue (as RISI does not do anything on the subject) and he is located in Germany. Below is the kind of information that he can make available to us as well as the costs. Can you please advice me on how much information we want to get from him based on what he wrote below?

Hi Ms. Causholli,

I have made recently a major multiclient study ""Outlook for World Tissue 
Business"" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
detailed Annexes).

If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
could easier fulfil your data needs.


Best regards

"newsprint update","The New York Times Co. reported a sharp drop in earnings for 3Q01 as advertising revenues, which were already on the decline, fell further in the wake of the September attacks.  The Times posted net earnings of $43.8 million in the 3 months ended September 30, down 42% from $75 million in the same period in 2000.  Total revenues fell 9%, compared to $767.7 million in the same period in 2000 and were led by a decline of 16% in advertising revenues.  On a positive note, for all of September, average daily circulation of the paper increased by about 130,000 copies, and NY Times is hopeful that a good portion of the new readers will stay with the Times, adding to its circulation base.  This earnings decrease was expected, as many leading publishers have been hurt by a advertising slump and the September attacks.

"Producers stick to their downtime guns in defense of falling paper prices","BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Several European paper producers, together with South Africa's Sappi, have taken severe downtime in the second quarter to prevent paper and board prices from plummeting due to weak demand. 
Sappi has taken massive downtime measures to battle adverse trading conditions in the coated fine paper market. The company took 150,000 tonnes of coated woodfree paper out of the European market during its third quarter ending June 30, which equals one week per month. The group's worldwide total curtailments for the period reached almost 250,000 tonnes of coated fine paper. Sappi will continue to cut capacity in its fourth quarter ending September 30, but the total tonnage may not be as high as in its third quarter. 
Stora Enso has also curtailed production in an effort to try and maintain prices. The company took 558,000 tonnes of paper and board out of the European and North American markets during the second quarter. Of that, 342,000 tonnes was market-related. Stora Enso does not foresee price pressure easing over the next few months and expects further market related curtailments will be necessary. The production cuts took 61,000 tonnes of magazine paper out of North America and 75,000 tonnes out of the European market. Fine paper output was slashed by 93,000 tonnes in Europe and 63,000 tonnes in North America. Packaging board production was cut by 50,000 tonnes. 
UPM-Kymmene has followed a policy of ""strict inventory management"" in order to defend prices against erosion in the face of slack demand. The company's global market related cutbacks totaled 410,000 tonnes in the first six months of this year, with 290,000 tonnes of downtime taken in the second quarter. A company spokesman would not reveal the breakdown for each grade but said, ""There is no big difference between publication paper and fine paper."" UPM-Kymmene indicated that coated groundwood prices are still under pressure and said the company will continue to wield the downtime sword if necessary. 
M-real also plans to continue cutting fine paper production in the third quarter, following massive downtime measures in the second quarter. M-real chopped its total paper output by 245,000 tonnes during the April-June period, of which almost 200,000 tonnes was fine paper. Total fine paper downtime for the January-June period reached 300,000 tonnes. The producer's capacity utilization ratio for coated fine paper slumped to 80 percent in the first six months of this year and the figure for uncoated fine paper stood at 93 percent.
Price rise push
While M-real has taken aggressive measures to balance production and demand, the company has also been trying to improve coated woodfree prices. Negotiations to raise indent prices for coated woodfree paper in Germany have been followed by similar measures in France. The company is confident that it will be successful in its plans to bring the weaker indent levels closer to stock prices.
Sappi has also increased indent prices for coated woodfrees but stock prices have remained unchanged. ""Indent prices have slipped slightly, we brought them back to where they were before. So there hasn't been a general price increase for coated woodfree paper in Europe,"" the company's executive chairman Eugene van As clarified. Sappi does not foresee a general price increase in the near future.

"Europe's spot market tails off","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, Aug. 10, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Europe is no longer the happy hunting ground it was for spot deal makers. With a weak Euro and rock bottom prices for regular business, there is little room for undercutting without sinking below production costs.
North American suppliers of spot hardwood tonnes have gradually disappeared from the European scene since the beginning of July. Their home market is a more lucrative place in present conditions. Canadian producers are already selling pulp at below full costs of production and suppliers from other parts of the world are coming up against the same predicament.
Eucalyptus, as one buyer in Germany put it, ""doesn't really exist on the spot market any more."" There is still some softwood around for those who seek spot tonnage. But the downtime which pulp mills have been forced to take, allied to the fact that there is precious little difference between the spot deals and the price for regular business, means buyers are more likely to be pestered by their regular suppliers to take their normal quota than by hawkers of spot tonnes out to do a deal.
What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is priced at around $400/tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equivalent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which June's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some $20-30/tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the Middle East to compete for Government tenders.
The availability of spot tonnes from Scandinavian producers could frustrate regular European buyers who need no extra tonnes and would have to break contracts to take advantage of this cheaper surplus.
Reports of much stronger buying activity in Asia also explain a shift in spot pulp supply away from Europe. But this could be tempered marginally by a fall in the price of radiata pine pulp supplied to the region by Latin American producers.
The Pulpex August 2001 NBSK contract closed up $10.25 last week at $407.5 DDU net. Pulpex is not an exact mirror of the spot market but has proved a useful barometer and this rise suggests that there is at least little more downward pressure on spot prices.
Spot prices in Europe during the week ending August 10 were: NBSK $370 - 400/tonne, eucalyptus $330 -340/tonne.

"Here it is","Hey Stacey,

Here is the info you requested:

O://industrial markets/fundamentals/paper/pulp/data

This spreadsheet has a lot of the data you requested. Check all the tabs. The most updated one is the RISI Prices tab. 

capacity sheet: O://industrial markets/fundamentals/paper/pulp/capacity

O://industrial markets/fundamentals/paper/information for all/Pulp-Newsprint-Corrugated. This sheet is updated monthly from Valos reports.


Again, we are still in the process of gathering data for pulp as we will purchase a lot of the data from PPPC, which we think is the best source. 
But you can start with the above spreadsheets.

Let me know if I can help further

"Foex Index","Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron Industrial Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and Elizabeth Hutchinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works. Right now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX index and the methodology behind it. I have seen one of the presentations that you have presented in the States a while ago but I am looking for a little bit more detail. For example, what kind of companies you contact, what percentage of industry they represent in terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, what geographic area these companies represent and anything else that you think its important to know. 

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli

"newsprint update, 10/22","Hello Team,

According to Editor & Publisher, 5 weeks after the September 11th attacks and 2 weeks into the anthrax scare, daily newspaper circulation is up strongly.  Of 40 dailies surveyed by Editor & Publisher during the past 10 days, 34 reported higher circulation, often up 0.5 -1.5%.  Acccording to E&P, if sustained, the gains could put the industry on a growth track for the first time in 40 years.  Let's see if the increased circulation levels will hold over the next several months - if heightened circulation levels persist, we can assess the impact on newsprint demand.

The Washington Post reported a decline in 3Q01 net income and revenues as the Company was hit by an industry-wide slump in advertising and the September 11th attacks.  The Company reported a net income of $1.6 million, or 14 cents a share, for its 3Q01, compared with $33.5 million, or $3.51 per share, a year ago. The Company's revenues were down 1%  from 3Q00.  

--

Pulitzer posted lower 3Q01 earnings, hurt by weak advertising spending.  The publisher of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Arizona Daily Star said its net earnings were $1.5 million, or 7 cents per diluted share, compared with $5 million, or 23 cents per share, a year ago.  Revenues in the period totaled $100.6 million, compared with $101.2 million a year earlier.  Nothing new here as many publishers have released lower 3Q01 results...

J.P. Morgan  has started coverage of the newspaper publishing sector, with a ``buy'' rating on Knight Ridder and ``long-term buy'' ratings on Gannett and New York Times.  The investment bank started Dow Jones & Co. at a ''market perform.''  J.P. Morgan said that it expects U.S. newspapers to experience a decline in advertising revenue of 8.6% this year and a fall of 2.2 % in 2002.  JP Morgan said it expects the current trend of declining readership and circulation to reverse in 2003, with growth returning to 2.8% to 3.3%.  I will send you any pertinent reports J.P. Morgan releases...

I am currently in San Diego at a RISI conference.  If you need anything, please call me at (832)721-3286.

"Japan's Oji Paper unveils plans for a huge capacity expansion in Asia","SINGAPORE, Aug. 20, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The Japanese giant, Oji Paper, has unveiled plans to add almost 1 million tonnes/yr of paper and board capacity in Asia, outside of Japan, by March 2006 at a total investment cost of Yen 150 billion ($1.2 billion). The group aims to carry out the ambitious expansion scheme through building greenfield mills or via mergers and acquisitions.
Oji has already taken the first step in the project. The group raised its stake in Japan Brazil Paper and Pulp Resources Development Company (JBP) in July to become the largest shareholder. JBP is a Japanese consortium that took over Brazil's Celulose Nipo-Brasileira (CENIBRA) last month, which has a bleached eucalyptus pulp capacity of 820,000 tonnes/yr. Oji shelled out Yen 18 billion for the additional JBP shares and plans to use the extra 250,000 tonnes/yr of pulp from CENIBRA to cater for its Asian expansions, according to Oji's spokesman, Takao Ito. 
Oji has set up a special unit, Asian Research Center, to promote the expansion scheme. The project team reports directly to Oji's new president, Shoichiro Suzuki, a senior engineer who assumed the top post in late June. Suzuki said in July that Oji aims to be an Asian group led from Japan and that Thailand and China are top priorities in its portfolio, according to Ito. He added that Oji's investment targets also include Indonesia and Vietnam. 
Oji's 1 million tonne/yr expansion goal includes building a large PM that has an uncoated and coated woodfree capacity of 500,000 tonnes/yr. The remainder of the 1 million tonne/yr capacity target will include 200,000 tonnes/yr of newsprint or lightweight coated paper, 150,000 tonnes/yr of board and 150,000 tonnes/yr of specialty grades used for communication papers. 
Oji will fund its Asian expansion projects through increased sales and its ongoing corporate restructuring program. The group aims to cut its workforce by 2,200 to 20,900 by March 2004. ""We have reduced staff, paid off debts and reorganized group companies,"" Ito indicated. Oji expects to save Yen 8 billion/yr from workforce retrenchment and Yen 3 billion/yr through streamlining production. 
""We see the plan as realistic and thought-out,"" said two analysts at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney, Peter Cain and Paul Blamire, in a recent report. They estimated that Oji's scheme suggested a cost of $1,200/tonne, which is comparable to the reported cost of some projects in Asia in recent years. ""In Japan, the most recent major capacity addition, Hokuetsu Paper's PM 8 at [the] Niigata [mill], cost approximately $1,825/tonne,"" the report continued. 
""Oji aims not to add substantial net capacity in Japan as it expands in Asia. This strategy gives it the option of producing locally for Asian markets or importing back to Japan if demand justifies,"" the report added. On top of that, the analysts believe that Oji's increased stake in CENIBRA was a sensible move ""since it avoids dependence on Indonesian pulp"". 
Oji has not yet announced any specific project under the Asian expansion scheme. But Suzuki revealed in July that Oji would not consider acquiring any of Asia Pulp & Paper's assets this year due to its complex debt issues, or making any investments in Indonesia given the country's political and economic uncertainty, Ito said. 
Cain believes that the most likely move for Oji is the expansion of its operations in Thailand. The group has a mill in Prachinburi which operates a 30,000 tonne/yr carbonless copy paper PM. The mill site has ample space for future growth and is adjacent to Advance Agro's (AA) plantation land. Cain pointed out that Oji owns a 5.5 percent stake in AA, but said Oji is unlikely to raise its stake in the joint venture which is still carrying out a debt restructuring program. Another factor in the country's favor is that, according to Ito, the production cost is 10 percent lower in Thailand than in Japan. 
Cain suggested that Oji may expand its newsprint and boxboard operations in Asia, rather than other grades where the market is already saturated. Japan imports around 60,000 tonnes/yr of newsprint, which means Oji could fill this gap. In addition, Oji is very good at producing high-quality boxboard, while Asian markets still rely a lot on imports, he added. 
As for Oji's plan to invest in a 500,000 tonne/yr coated and uncoated woodfree PM, Cain said that the group could install the unit in China but that it is not really viable. China is facing overcapacity in these grades in the near future due to a flurry of new capacity due to come online. On top of that, Stora Enso filed an application with the Chinese government for the approval of a scheme to invest in a 500,000 tonne/yr coated woodfree PM late last year. The project is still at the pre-planning stage though and the approval process can take three years or more. Ito admitted that Oji has not yet submitted any expansion proposals to the authorities.

"1-800-O-CANADA","Dear Team,

Kindly note that I discovered a great new resource late last week that you may or may not already be aware of.  In the course of tracking down some data, I found that the Canadian government has a 1-800 number with operators standing by to answer any and all questions relating to Canadian industry and regulation.  For instance, if you're wondering if any federal agency tracks forestry management licenses, you can simply call to find out (incidentally, the answer is no).

This may prove particularly helpful to the lumber and newsprint teams whose interests are naturally weighted toward Canadian production and regulation.  The number is 1-800-O-CANADA (1-800-622-6232).

Hope you find it helpful!
Vikram

Hello Ivonne,

I do not have an insurance card for the vision health plan. Can you tell me what I need to do to before I go to a doctor? Also should I find my own doctor or is there a list of names provided. Can you clarify this to me or tell me who do I need to contact for this?

"Chinese traders comes under pressure as softwood pulp prices drop in Asia","paperloop.com
SINGAPORE, Aug. 7, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Chinese pulp traders who have stockpiled northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) and radiata pine pulp are facing pressure following price slides for these grades. In early August, a major Latin American supplier slashed its radiata pine list price for Chinese buyers by $40/tonne. The move stunned the well-stocked traders, who may have to sell off their volumes at prices lower than they paid for them. 
But in the hardwood sector, certain suppliers and traders are expecting prices to bounce back and creep up by $10-20/tonne in September, although some say the chances of this happening are low.
One Canadian supplier, who pointed toward a rash of pulp downtime taken by his fellow countrymen, reported that softwood prices have hit rock bottom. ""All of this downtime is related to low prices that they cannot compete with,"" he said. He indicated that softwood pricing has begun to stabilize, but does not foresee any price improvements before the end of September.
The hardwood pulp market's immediate future seems brighter. Suppliers reported that Korean buyers have taken large volumes of Brazilian eucalyptus in June and July to build up inventories at low prices. But Korea's overall buying activity reached just 70 percent of its normal level in these two months. The country's weak paper and board market and sagging exports drove Korea's major paper producers to take five days of downtime in July.
In China, Brazilian eucalyptus which is competitively priced continues to have the edge over Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood pulp. Many paper mills have switched to Brazilian eucalyptus from Indonesian hardwood as the price differential between the two grades has narrowed to around $10/tonne from the traditional gap of $60/tonne. 
Another hardwood grade which saw demand pick up was bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (BCTMP). Traders reported that consumption of the grade has been growing fast in China, although prices remained unchanged from mid-July.
Softwood sees price slides
NBSK prices have dropped $10/tonne for regular Asian buyers. Spot prices in China and Korea are also down $10/tonne. Russian bleached softwood pulp prices in China stayed flat with consumption steady. Radiata pine prices have slipped $20/tonne for regular buyers and $10-20/tonne in China and Korea for spot business. Southern pine prices are unchanged in China, Japan and Korea, but trading is minimal. Unbleached softwood kraft pulp prices are steady throughout Asia. 
Hardwood prices stabilize
Brazilian eucalyptus prices remain unchanged for regular buyers. But spot prices in China and Korea have edged up slightly. Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood prices also inched up by $10/tonne at the bottom of the price range across Asia, but trading has been declining. Northern mixed hardwood prices remain unchanged in Japan and Korea, while southern mixed hardwood prices are stable across Asia. BCTMP prices are also flat for regular buyers and for spot business in China and Korea.

"Abitibi market pulp sales from Fort Frances","As I suggested earlier, it appears that Abitibi has no response to Boise's move to reduce or eliminate its purchase of slush pulp from Abitibi's Fort Frances (ON) mill. Right now it appears Abitibi will allow the pulp line at FF to go down when Boise stops purchasing from the mill. 

This may create an opportunity for us to finance installation of a pulp dryer at FF in return for offtake,  although I suspect the competitive cost position of the FF pulp line probably would make it a better strategy for us to focus our efforts on St. Felicien. (Also I don't know that Abitibi would be interested in a pulp dryer at FF.)

Monika, for our pulp specialist who's coming to town on Thursday, could you see if one of the pulp originators has a basic presentation on Enron's forest products business that we could e-mail to him before Wednesday afternoon?

Thanks,
Dave

David,

Thanks for all the info from you and Nyree.  Dinner Thursday is fine.  The
only stuff I have not got is info about your plans, mill ownership, etc.
Perhaps you would prefer to discuss when I see you at 0900 on Thursday.
That's OK with me.  How about a list of assets you own or investments you
have in the forest products business?  Whatever you can send would be
appreciated.

See you Thursday.

Allen

Allen,

First of all, dress code is business casual (khakis etc.). My assistant,
Nyree Chanaba, will get back to you with particulars on the hotel. It
will probably be the Hyatt, which is kitty-corner from our office. But
whichever hotel it is, the concierge will be able to direct you to the
Enron Building: it's well-known, and we'll have you within 2-3 blocks of
our office at the most.

The morning session is for quiet conversations with anybody who wants
one-on-one time with you. At this point I don't know whether that will
be a lot of people or a few (we're in the middle of vacation time so
it's hard to predict attendance), but I would say 9 a.m. would be good.
Go to the lobby of the building and ask the security guards to call me
or Nyree (we're on the 29th floor).

If it's OK with you, why don't you pay your hotel bill and then fax me
the bill when you get home on Friday so we can cut a check.

If you're not too tired of Enron people at that time, I'd like to take
you out to dinner on Thursday night.

As to the projector, we'll have something set up; in case the connection
doesn't work we also have laptops we can hook up.

We'll communicate more as the week goes on. We look forward to seeing
you!

Dave

Hi, David,

A couple of questions:

*  dress code for visit
*  address and name of hotel.  My plane (DL 1857)is scheduled to arrive
at
1853.  I plan to go directly to the hotel.
*  do you want me to pay the bill and rebill you when I send the
invoice?
*  directions from the hotel to your office?  When do you want me to be
there on Thursday?
*  I plan to bring my laptop with several ppt presentations to show.  Do
you
have a hookup for the laptop to a projector?  I 	plan to leave a
copy of the
ppt slides with you if you have a zip file that can download them from
my
laptop.
*  I believe you were going to send me some info about Enron's plans and
objectives, now that I am on the team and have 	signed the
confidentiality
agreements.
*  any other questions I need to ask?

See you on Thursday.

Allen

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Here is what I got from Timo Teras at the Foex on their methodology in calculating the pix

To: Causholli, Monika
Cc: tuula@foex.fi
Subject: Re: Foex Index; yr two e-mails


Hi Monika,

Welcome to the pulp and paper world.

In order to understand the index system, the first thing is to look at our
web-site www.foex.fi which includes a lot of information, particularly in
this case the FAQ section. You probably have taken a look at that already,
though.

Our two pulp indexes, NBSKP (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) and BHKP
(birch+eucalyptus) cover the European market. As abt 40% of the world pulp
trade is for the European market, these are, in a way, considered to be the
""world market prices"", particularly as the third biggest market, North
America (Asia is the second biggest) has virtually the same prices as
Europe; correlation between the two is well over 0.9.

The sellers reporting to us are, by definition, in NBSKP from Canada, US
West Coast and the Nordic countries. BHKP (birch, euca) sellers are from the
Nordic region, Latin America, Spain and Portugal and a number of
Asian/African companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market.
Buyers are European producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some
of their pulp from the open market, representing virtually all countires in
Western Europe. The split between birch and euca is approximately 30%/70%,
again reflecting the actual situation in the European market.

The exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received
from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some
are not. The producers reporting to us represent roughly 80% of the supply
to Europe in the two benchmark grades.

Most (=80-90%) of the pulp sold in Europe is so-called contract business.
This means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract
covering the grades and volumes, quantity rebates etc. However, prices are
fixed also for contract business on a monthly/quarterly basis. Most of the
pulp arriving Continental Europe or UK from abroad, goes through consignment
warehouses (in places like Antwerp, Rotterdam, La Pallice, Tilbury,
Savono-Livorno range etc.). As forwarding companies allow 30-60 days of free
storage, buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp,
delivered by sellers in large shipments, little be little by lorry, rail or
barge. Each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the
price reported to us, before customer specific rebates. Prices are for prime
grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following
month.

The following comments are worth making:
- Our system is based on first taking off top 10% and bottom 10% of the
prices received and only then calculating the index (or rather benchmark)
values. This way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well
as any theoretical attempts of manipulation (we have never detected any
attempts)
- We have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and
sellers. Some we receive through agents/merchants/trading houses - usually
mandated by a supplier to give us the price data
- If someone does not report their prices on a given week, we can use the
previous week's data but only once
- Prices are not volume-weighted (in order to avoid the manipulation
possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier
sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones)
- Prices are CIF European port before customer-specific rebates (again to
avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain
unchanged; also, rebates are often given only afterwards - e.g. when
exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold - and we cannot alter our indexes
retroactively)
- Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European
Community anti-trust regulators (=DG IV) and audited by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
- There is a group of independent experts, case need, as ""trouble shooters"".
Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the
index values.
- Participation is totally voluntary
- The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes
and Pulpex quotations include:
a) our prices are before customer-specific rebates (averaging 5-6%), Pulpex
prices are net
b) our prices are for contract business, Pulpex prices represent the lowest
spot-levels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market
c) our price info is based on actual sales, Pulpex prices are expectations
what the spot price might be in e.g. 3 month's time
d) our price is for a prime quality (within each benchmark grade there are
surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold) approved
by a seller from a particular supplier/mill, whilst Pulpex prices, based on
a delivery concept (i.e. you do not accept the price offered to close a
contract, you can make/take delivery), are prices in a particular inventory
location (3-4 alternative ones), sometimes far away from buyer's or seller's
normal ports for any lot (often unknown/unwanted grade, up to 11 months and
29 days old goods). This system tends to emphasize in the Pulpex system the
extreme prices, up or down, particularly in these early stages with low
liquidity.
- Our indexes are trade-marked products. Therefore their use for any
commercial purposes is possible only with our permission. To get that
permission, users pay us a small premium, the main source of our income.
Enron and FOEX Indexes Ltd. have a contract, Bob Crane has the details at
your end.

I trust this is helpful. I encourage you to contact us anew for any
additional questions.

Please find enclosed, for order's sake our pulp specs, some additional
comments we send to the price providers and the historical price series you
asked for (historical series are still without today's indexes, to be
published about an hour from sending this message; you can add those from
our web-site by the time you read this).

My best regards to you as well as to David and Elizabeth.

Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron
Industrial Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and
Elizabeth Hutchinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works.
Right now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX
index and the methodology behind it. I have seen one of the
presentations that you have presented in the States a while ago but I am
looking for a little bit more detail. For example, what kind of
companies you contact, what percentage of industry they represent in
terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, what geographic area
these companies represent and anything else that you think its important
to know.

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli

Stora Enso launches EUR 365M pulp line at Imatra, Finland, mill complex

10/01/2001 12:45:48, Press Release 


HELSINKI, Oct. 1, 2001 (press release) -- Stora Enso's Imatra mills form one of Europe's largest wood processing complexes, which now includes Europe's largest integrated pulp mill, following the inauguration of the new fibre line there today. The new line produces bleached birch pulp for the company's own paper and board mills. The main products of the Imatra mills are liquid packaging boards, boards for the food and drinks industry and fine paper. 

The new fibre line strengthens the Imatra mills' position as the only integrated manufacturer of liquid packaging boards and boards for the food and drinks industry. The mills produce all four different types of pulp required: bleached softwood pulp, bleached birch pulp, unbleached softwood pulp and thermomechanical pulp.

The new fibre line meets the latest environmental standards and optimises usage of raw materials. Water consumption has been decreased by dry debarking and the introduction of modern, efficient fibre production technology. Effluent discharges into waterways have been reduced. Odours have also been reduced by more effective recovery and processing of malodorous gases, which are utilised in producing the impregnation solution for thermomechanical pulping. The new production lines will be quieter, too.

Increased black liquor combustion will raise the proportion of energy generated from biofuels at the Imatra mills to 85%. 

In addition to the new fibre line, the former birch pulping line at Imatra has been modernized to produce pine pulp, and the bleached softwood pulping line at Kaukopaa has been shut down because it no longer met current production and environmental protection requirements. The project also included expansion of wood treatment, upgrading of the power plant and installation of a new pulp dryer. The total cost of the project was 365 million euros, and most of the new facilities were already in use in spring 2001....

"FW: Foex ix up","Monika,

I think an important point to make is not just that the FOEX was up for the period, but that this is the third week of increases for the hardwoods index after several mixed months (both increases and decreases).  However, it's also significant that this week's increase is less than that of last week indicating that the market has not yet found direction.

In terms of the NBSK index, I think it'd be important to point out that this is the first increase in the index since April of this year.  Again, I don't believe this indicates any firm direction in the market, but it's nonetheless a significant event.

"Sappi fights back against tough market conditions with production cuts","paperlooop.com
BRUSSELS, July 31, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Sappi has taken massive downtime measures over the past three months to battle adverse trading conditions in the coated fine paper market. ""Coated fine paper is probably the worst market you can be at in 2001,"" the company's executive chairman, Eugene van As, said. ""We have taken severe production curtailments in this quarter. The market has been extremely difficult and the paper industry generally, I think, has taken a lot of curtailments,"" he added.
Sappi took 150,000 tonnes of coated fine paper out of the European market during the third quarter, which equals one week a month, in a bid to match output to market requirements. The group's worldwide total downtime tonnage for the period reached almost 250,000 tonnes of coated fine paper. 
Sappi will continue to cut capacity in the fourth quarter but the total tonnage might not be as high as in the third quarter. There has been a clear reduction in paper consumption and advertising levels have dropped, but the company expects an upturn in consumption and demand, which would in turn mean less downtime, van As explained. 
The market has been hit by declining advertising revenues and huge new capacity that has come on line both in Europe and Asia. He singled out Asian Pulp & Paper (APP) as one culprit for disruptions in the Asian coated fine paper market. APP has built over a million tonnes of new capacity in the last two years, and ""they are running these facilities for cash,"" van As criticized. As a result, producers have tried selling more in the US, adding pressure to that market. 
On the hot topic of price increases in the European coated fine paper market, van As said that Sappi has increased indent prices but stock prices have remained unchanged. ""Indent prices have slipped slightly, we brought them back to where they were before. So there hasn't been a general price increase for coated woodfree paper in Europe,"" he clarified. Sappi does not foresee a general price increase in the future either, according to van As. 
Sappi expects its fourth quarter results to be similar to the third quarter figures. Inventory levels are low and general economic recovery should bring relief to the industry. ""When the economic upturn happens and the inventory pipeline is empty, there will be a fairly rapid rebound in earnings for paper companies,"" van As said.

"newsprint update, 11/19","Hello Team,

Knight Ridder warned that its full-year earnings were likely to fall short of its expectations, citing a prolonged downturn in the advertising market that hurt October sales.   E.W. Scripps Co.  publisher of the Denver Rocky Mountain News, has also warned of lower earnings.  Gannett Co.  announced that October pro forma advertising revenues fell 8%, including a 31% drop in help wanted ads.  None of this comes as a surprise amidst a weak ad market and a sluggish economy.

According to the Fed, the U.S. industrial output last month took its biggest dive in nearly 20 years and extended a string of monthly declines that was the longest since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  The output for the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell 1.1% in October, the biggest decrease since it plunged 1.6 % in January 1982.   The portion of production capacity put to use by industries in October slid to 74.8% , the lowest since June 1983, from 75.7% in September.  No good news here...

"International Paper and Stora Enso rumored be in merger talks","STOCKHOLM, Aug. 22, 2001 (Reuters) - Finnish-Swedish Stora Enso and International Paper are in talks on the world's largest forest industry merger, Swedish daily Dagens Industri reported on Wednesday. 
If the companies were to merge, they would create a forest industry giant with annual sales of more than SEK 400 billion ($38.68 billion). IP is the world's largest papermaker in terms of output and Stora Enso is number two. Dagens Industri said it was basing its reports on sources which it did not identify. 
Officials at Stora Enso were not immediately available for comment. Were a merger to take place, it would create a dominant sector player with a market capitalization of some $30 billion, according to data from Reuters Securities 3000. 
Consolidation has picked up in the forest industry over the past few years as firms try to counter cyclical trends and the slowing global economy. Stora Enso bought US Consolidated Paper in 2000 to vault the firm into number two globally, while sector leader IP bought US Champion International also last year after winning a bidding war with Finnish UPM-Kymmene . 
IP shares ended flat at $41.04 overnight, while Stora Enso shares in Helsinki slipped slightly to Euro 12.32 ($11.29).

Mercer International Inc. (Nasdaq:MERCS, Easdaq:MERC GR) announced today that a joint venture led by Mercer has accepted the offer from Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG to act as the lead financial arranger and underwriter on the credit facilities for the Stendal pulp mill project to construct a 550,000-tonne Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft pulp facility.Financial close is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2002, as previously announced, pending the completion of certain terms and conditions for the facility, including completion of amendments to the permitting process, the receipt of confirmation of government grants and loan guarantees and other documentation customary to a syndicated loan. At financial close Mercer's ownership position in the joint venture will be 57.5%, as previously announced. Its partners, TESSAG Indsutrie-Anlagen GmbH and AIG Altmark-Industrie AG, will own 29.4% and 13.1%, respectively.

Any chance you could calculate the compound annual growth rates in capacity for hardwoods and the rate for softwoods?  Could you do it by region and also globally?  Thanks.

"NBSK pulp prices head further south in Europe","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, Aug. 9, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) prices settled at $460/tonne for regular business during the past week as $480/tonne disappeared into the sunset. Speculation about where levels will end up next puts the price at $440-450/tonne by the end of the month. There are reports that some contract business has already been concluded at $450/tonne.
Norscan inventory figures for July are awaited eagerly. One supplier asserted that a reasonable drop in Norscan stocks would be enough to hold the price of NBSK at $460/tonne. Downtime in British Columbia, Canada, has been particularly strong and there are hopes that this will tug down the Norscan inventories. Stocks of pulp at European ports dropped by 44,000 tonnes from June to July, according to Europulp's figures.
FOEX showed a slide in the price of NBSK of over $10/tonne to $458.92/tonne on August 7 from the previous week's $469.23/tonne. Eucalyptus and birch declined from Euro 458.30/tonne to Euro 449.08/tonne during the same period.
Many price agreements for regular business over the past few weeks have covered July and August. While this can be attributed to the mid-year vacation period effect - any price movement would be irrelevant in Italy in August, for example - market makers believe that a genuine flattening out has occurred and that a period of stability can be expected, albeit at rock bottom prices.
Softwood pulp remains available in Europe for spot deals, although the regular price is so close to the spot price that buyers are more likely to be pestered by their regular suppliers than by one-off deal makers. What little Canadian NBSK that is available on the European spot market is priced at around $400/tonne. This is rather more than the Scandinavian equivalent, which has arrived on the market thanks to the over-production which June's Norscan figures revealed. Much of this pulp, which is available at some $20-30/tonne cheaper than Canadian NBSK, has found its way to Asia and the Middle East to compete for government tenders.
The Pulpex August 2001 NBSK contract closed up $10.25 at $407.5/tonne DDU net the week ending August 3. Pulpex is not an exact mirror of the spot market but has proved a useful barometer and this rise suggests that there is at least little further downward pressure on spot prices.
One supplier believes that a period of restocking by buyers can be expected in September, as just-in-time purchasing in the expectation of further price cuts would no longer be necessary. This would in reality be nothing but a shift of inventory from supplier to buyer. Only a rejuvenated paper market can drag market pulp out of its trough and there is no guarantee that buyers will have the liquidity to increase their stocks even if they wish to. One of the more optimistic analysts said, ""The fundamentals are not there for a price increase before October.""

"Samoa Pacific to restart pulp production in California","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 17, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Samoa Pacific Cellulose, LLC said yesterday it would restart production at its 200,000 tonne/yr pulp mill in Northern California about 10 days ahead of schedule. The shutter, which began June 23, is slated to end Friday, said a company source.
""We had projected around a month of downtime,"" said the source, who indicated that Samoa Pacific's downtime would still total about 17,700 tonnes for the third quarter. Based on the mill's capacity, it will have lost about 15,500 tonnes during the 27-day shutter. 
""We would hope not to go down again for the year. Four weeks (of market related downtime) was projected but we didn't know if it would slide another week or not."" 
The Samoa mill produces 100 percent chlorine-free processed (TCF) bleached and unbleached softwood and hardwood kraft pulps. The official noted that the mill will ""do as much bleached pulp as we can sell"" as it moves to supply more specialized pulps and less commodity tonnage, which has taken the largest hit in prices both in the U.S. and Asia. Roughly 50 percent of the mill's output is sold to Asian markets.
""We've been looking for better markets and developing new customers and maintaining our current ones,"" said the source. ""U.S. prices seem a little better for what we're doing, more specialty in the U.S. Unfortunately, unbleached is in demand in Asia where it's commodity.""

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Hi, Monika, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I'm back. I'm sorry to hear about a possibility of you losing your 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;job. That just sucks. Hopefully things will get better soon. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I'm doing Ok, had a great time in NYC, we did and saw a lot of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;things. Now it's back to classes and studying--yak. I still have 2 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;more weeks and then exams and then I'm going home for 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Christmas--can't wait. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I'll try calling you sometime after Wednesday--I have a big final 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that day. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Remember no matter what happens with your job it will be for the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;better. Miss you lots. L.,

"Re: BMG",">>> do you know any phone number for BMG?

As far as I know, they do not do any customer service over the phone.
(A cost-saving policy, I assume.)  The best way to contact them is to
go to their web site, proceed to the customer service section, and use
the online forms to contact them.  If you are more comfortable with
low-tech methods of communication, simply send them a letter via snail
mail to the customer service address listed in your monthly magazine.

"questions","Hello Margaret,


I don't know if you remember but I gave you my and my husband's passports to obtain H1b visas in Washington DC. You said that I have to fill out a couple of forms before they were send out. Does that sound right to you or did I understand it wrong?
Do you know how long it takes for the forms to be mailed? The reason I am asking this question is because I am afraid that the visa process will be delayed and I have plans to travel in December. Without bothering you too much, can you explain to me the procedure. For example, Do I have to fill these two forms before the passports are mailed to DC or after. If I have to fill these forms before how can I speed up the process?

thank you,
Monika Causholli

Thanks to all of you for your patience and assistance during the move process.  Just a couple of things we want to remind you of/update you on.
 


Friday, October 12 is move day.  Please assure all boxes are packed by 5:00 p.m.  Movers will begin at 5:00 p.m.

Remember to get rid of as much as you can prior to moving - - space is limited.

There are boxes in the freight elevator lobby.  Feel free to take as many as you need.  There are also shred bins which are the large blue containers.  Please put only confidential papers in these bins as we will be paying for shredding by the pound.

Because movers will begin at 5:00 p.m. on Friday, the Graphics department will need to begin packing as early as possible.  No requests will be taken after 12:00 noon on Friday.

In an effort to help you with your packing on Friday and your unpacking on Monday, EIM Office of the Chairman will be supplying lunch for those wishing to stay in and pack/unpack during the lunch hour.

If you have any move related questions please contact Marsha at x-33356.


 
Thanks again to all of you for your cooperation and a special thanks to all the Points of Contact for a job well done on preparing churns and passing along information.

Can you provide a similar analysis for mixed tropical hardwoods versus NBSK?  Acacia versus NBSK?  We have an opportunity to pursue these commodities and provide structured solutions, etc.

"U.S. pulp market remains weak; producers reduce stocks, discounting continues","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - North American market pulp prices tumbled for the seventh time in as many months on seasonal weak demand and continued papermaker downtime. Benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) declined 7.4 percent or $40/tonne to $500/tonne, while other pulp grades fell less. 
Some producers indicated they ""have no list"" prices anymore as deals have increasingly occurred on a case-by-case basis, while one major producer said it had abandoned its list two months ago and has simply discounted. 
The sustained drop in prices prompted both sellers and buyers to note last week that even suppliers holding low inventories aren't able to leverage themselves in pricing. A large-volume buyer source said that his firm's discounts ""are anywhere from 5 percent to double digits,"" even off the latest prices.
Many producers continued offloading pulp to markets such as China, South Korea and Taiwan as prices there appear to have leveled off at low levels. Market watchers last week expressed concern with global inventories and the wholesale exports to non-Japan Asian markets.
""I'm concerned with what will happen (to inventories) through July and August,"" said a Canadian industry consultant, who said that although pricing dynamics could improve after September, producers may fight inventory surges all year. ""I hope they don't overproduce. This cycle is harsher than most cycles because of paper downtime.""
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Chip Dillon noted in a report that the latest inventories are, ""well above the 1.5 million tonne 'inflection' level...total inventories combined typically rise over 230,000 tonnes during July and August (so) we believe pulp prices will remain under pressure.""
Various North American producers have declined selling pulp to Asian markets on below cash-cost prices, but buyers there continue to bargain hunt from second or third suppliers. Because of lower operating costs and the availability of cheap NBSK, a buyer source said that his firm's paper machines are profitably running at 100 percent through the summer season. ""Some suppliers have more inventory than others and have no choice but to sell,"" noted the buyer.
Meanwhile, several pulp producers have attempted to offset poor demand conditions by further curtailing production. Tembec Inc. said it would slash its pulp output by at least 100,000 tonnes during the third quarter, matching the downtime it had taken through the first two quarters combined. Although Tembec didn't announce which mills or grades of pulp would be affected, an industry source said that Tembec was taking a month of downtime at its Crestbrook mill in Skookumchuck, B.C. With capacity to produce 227,000 tonnes/yr of NBSK, the mill's downtime would represent about 19,440 tonnes.
Weyerhaeuser recently told customers it would take about 54,000 tonnes of primarily NBSK market-related downtime during the third quarter. A Weyerhaeuser official said its mill in Prince Albert, Sask., would trim about 14,000 tonnes of NBSK and NBHK; 24,000 tonnes of NBSK would be cut at its mill in Grand Prairie, Alta., at a time to be determined later; and its Kamloops, B.C., mill would cut 16,500 tonnes of NBSK during outages in August and September. 
Additionally, the official expected that incremental tonnage would be lost during some maintenance downtime during the quarter. The downtime at Weyerhaeuser ""reflects softness in fine paper demand,"" said the official. ""Demand to Europe is particularly soft and with the strong dollar we have currency issues.""
Other producers are reducing supplies without acknowledging their curtailments. Producer sources in British Columbia said that Celgar Pulp Co. in Castlegar, B.C., would shut down production for about 35 days due to market reasons. With capacity to produce about 425,000 tonnes/yr of NBSK, the outage could clip about 42,490 tonnes from supplies.
A source at Western Pulp Ltd. said the Vancouver, B.C., firm had extended the shutdown its 255,000 tonne/yr NBSK pulp mill in Squamish due to continued soft demand. The downtime, which began on June 1, is expected to total six weeks, said the source. Western Pulp's Squamish operation will likely cut at least 30,000 tonnes from supplies during the closure, said the source.
In Wisconsin, an NBHK mill is currently shut down for market reasons and a company source said it would chop about 20,000 tonnes from production before restarting later this month. 
""In the fourth quarter, these kraft mills can't shut down,"" said the source. ""You have to run during the winter, but right now you can take a mill down. If the downtime isn't taken now, you will see a real bloodletting in the fourth quarter.""

"Frantschach Steti plans upgrade of pulp lines and PM in Czech Republic","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, July 18, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Frantschach Pulp and Paper has ordered an automatic chip storage and reclaiming system for its two pulp lines at the Steti plant in the Czech Republic. The revamp will be implemented in two stages to avoid a shutdown. The first phase of the upgrade will be completed in February 2002 and the final work will be wrapped up in July 2002. 
 A spokesman said the Steti mill produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of bleached and unbleached kraft pulp. The new system will enhance safety and product quality. 
Steti's paper mill produces 200,000 tonnes/yr of sack paper, machine-glazed (MG) wrapping paper and linerboard. A revamp of the plant's PM is also planned for next year. The unit's 12,000 tonnes/yr capacity of MG paper is set to gradually rise to 31,000 tonnes/yr following the upgrade.

Thanks very much! I'll check it out.

Monika, could you forward to me the file with your market pulp originator newsletter in it? Some of our originators would like to send it out of the company to potential counterparties, and I would like to look at the wording to make sure we can send it out: the wording for an internal document may be more frank and open than a document that's intended for external distribution.

Peggy, did I hear you say you got some legal language for a disclaimer for steel? I wonder if we can use that on the market pulp and other originator letters to make sure they can be used externally?

Great to hv you onboard. I have already seen all the postings on the Fundy website but nothing new. All I need is some other pulp presentations done for other companies. I just need to follow the format and use some of the slides to modify. 

I need some information on Phoenix Pulp regard their new increase in capacity. They are having some expansion plan in their mill. Their capacity will increase by another 220,000mt in the year 2003/4. Please help me check it out. Please find out what kind of pulp will they be producing in this new capacity.

I am replacing  Dimitri as the pulp analyst so in the future send the requests to me.

First, we do not have any readily available presentations on any of those two companies.
You can go to the EIM fundies website under companies and there is some info there about Advance Agro Public, I am not sure about Phoenix Pulp though. 

Also, if this info is not what you want can you be more specific as to exactly what you want reported on these two companies?

let me know if this helps,

Subject:	World market pulp inventories fall nearly 10 percent  

The good news for the pulp producers continue as worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 345,000 tonnes in September from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. World inventories have fallen seven consecutive months as producers reduced their stocks 9.7 percent from opening levels.
World producer stocks closed September at 3.073 million tonnes, representing 33 days of supply and a four-day reduction from August levels. Producer inventory results are 19.4 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. The inventory results were by far the largest single month reduction this year. The year's prior high was in June, when producers brought down inventories by 171,000 tonnes but faced a bloated 3.528 million tonnes of stock. 
September production of 2.525 million tonnes tumbled 10.2 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.812 million tonnes. Production levels were 5.9 percent lower than the prior month. 
Global shipments improved both month-over-month and compared to the same period last year. Shipments of 2.870 million tonnes rose 2.8 percent higher than year-ago results of 2.792 million tonnes, and surged by 4.4 percent vs. August despite a slower week of activity following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Producers operated at 84 percent of capacity in September, down 11 percent from the same time last year when producers ran at 95 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced another 5 points to 95 percent, PPPC reported.

"RE: Pulp Meeting Mondays","Dave,

I actually have asked Rodney long time ago that I wanted to be a part of the Monday morning meetings but he didn't want anyone other than traders in that meeting. I guess he changed his mind. Anyways, I would love to be a part of the meetings and maybe Karen and I can take turn to go in there.

Dave,

At a number of the pulp meetings we have had discussions around information we would like to gather in the marketplace.  Until now I had been erring on the side of smaller meetings to facilitate better discussion but I think it would be more helpful to have one person from fundamentals present at the pulp meetings on Mondays at 9:00.  This should be the person that is doing most of the work on pulp.  Please let me know who you think the best person to attend would be.

Thanks,
Rodney

We can use the disclaimer for anything - the legal group did ask to see the ""first"" one of anything that we decided to send out.  Do we want Laura to take a look at developing a standard ""format"" for the outside newsletter and include some key pricing parameters?  I would also suggest that we review the ""first issue"" and the proposed format with Jennifer Walker.  

Here is the language for the disclaimer:

Enron Industrial Markets and its affiliates are engaged in the trading of steel and related commodities, and swaps, options, forwards and other derivatives on such commodities, for their own accounts and such trading could affect the markets for or prices of such commodities or derivatives.  The markets for and prices of such commodities and derivatives could also be affected by a variety of other factors, including supply and distribution factors, activities of other market participants and economic conditions generally.  Enron Industrial Markets and its affiliates assume no liability or responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any information contained herein or for ensuring that any such information is current or updated.

The user is solely responsible for any investment or trading decisions made on the basis of this information.  The information set forth herein is subject to change without notice at any time.

A tad bit wordy, but if it will keep us from having to review every issue with legal, it is a good thing.

Thanks very much! I'll check it out.

Monika, could you forward to me the file with your market pulp originator newsletter in it? Some of our originators would like to send it out of the company to potential counterparties, and I would like to look at the wording to make sure we can send it out: the wording for an internal document may be more frank and open than a document that's intended for external distribution.

Peggy, did I hear you say you got some legal language for a disclaimer for steel? I wonder if we can use that on the market pulp and other originator letters to make sure they can be used externally?

"FOEX and September PPPC Flash Report","Hello Team,
 
The FOEX US pix paper index for newsprint is down  $6.22 from $530.87 last week to $524.65 this week.  The decline continues... 
 
PPPC released its September Flash report for newsprint.  Please find the Flash report notes below and the September numbers attached in the file below:


Production at North American mills was 15.6% lower than in September of last year, resulting in an 82% operating rate. If we exclude the 130,000 tonnes of idled capacity at the Steilacoom WA mill, the North American operating rate would be 83%. 

Total North American newsprint shipments were down 15.4% year-over-year in September, largely the result of North American demand falling off by 15%. This drop in demand can be explained in part by consumers reducing their stock levels in September 2001. This explains why consumption figures registered a lower year-over-year decrease for the current month.

Shipments to overseas markets also suffered a decline, dropping almost 17% compared to the same month last year, as North American deliveries to Western Europe fell 41%. 

At the end of  September, North American mills saw their inventories decrease by 28,000 tonnes from the preceding month to 477,000 tonnes, and therefore back below their historical average. 

US dailies consumed 9.1% less newsprint than in September 2000, and total consumption in the US was down 9%. Many publishers reported a substantial increase in newsprint usage to cover the September 11th tragedy (additional sections, increased single-copy sales), especially in the week that immediately followed it. However, the increase in consumption seems in effect to have been offset by the wave of advertising cancellations in the aftermath of the attack. At the end of the month, US dailies stock levels were 84,000 tonnes lower than the preceding month. Thus US dailies stocks fell from 43 days of supply at the end of August to 38 days of supply at the end September.

Pulp Update: Inventory Rise in July Well Below Average; Goldman Sachs High
Yield Research; 8/14/01

Norscan pulp inventories rose just 4,000 tonnes in July, which is well below
the typical seasonal increase of approximately 150,000 tonnes.  Amidst all
the bad news about the pulp environment, this is good news.  Producer
downtime is certainly helping.  However, pulp prices remain quite weak, and
inventories of 1.78 million tonnes are still too high to allow for any
tightening of supply and demand in the short term.

We will distribute details of the July pulp report once they are available.

Dear Team,

In the next couple of weeks, I will be scheduling meetings with the individual pulp originators.  We are gathering information on the pulp business and the originators' individual strategies when prospecting and maintaining client relationships.  

To prepare for these meetings, I would like to develop an outline of questions that we would like to discuss with the originators.  I hope to get their views on the industry, problems, and success stories.

I will scheduling a meeting later this week to discuss the strategies for these meetings.  In the meantime, would you put down topics or questions that you would like to discuss?  If you have any questions, please let me know.


Thanks,

It must be all the German blood coursing through my veins because I'm always suspicious of such a positive result.  We should definately try some exponential smoothing (don't ask me anymore about this topic as I don't know anything --- it's something to discuss with MT) to make sure these correllations are really that high.

"Mexico's Durango ends labor row to reopen paper plant","MONTERREY, Mexico, Aug. 30, 2001 (Reuters) - Mexican paper company Grupo Industrial Durango (Gidusa) said on Thursday it will reopen a plant in western Mexico after ending a four-month-old labor dispute.
The company said in a statement it agreed with workers at the Jalisco state plant to terminate and replace a collective bargaining contract in place for 55 years. The plant of affiliate Compania Industrial Atenquique was closed in April due to high labor costs, representing 25% of production compared with 8-10% at other plants.
""The final liquidation of the collective work contract was made under requirement of the law, respecting workers' rights,"" the company said. ""Compania Industrial de Atenquique plans to reopen this important industrial center in the coming weeks, with a new collective work contract."" The plant produces 132,000 tonnes/yr of paper.

"European pulp market looks to have bottomed out, but recovery is not yet on the cards","BRUSSELS, Aug. 23, 2001 (paperloop.com) - In a quiet market due to the mid-year vacation period, there have been reports that buyers have sought to settle pulp prices for the next three months. This suggests that the threat of a price rise in the near future is being taken seriously, or at least that prices are believed to have fallen as low as possible. The fear of buying pulp today on the basis that it might be cheaper tomorrow seems to have all but disappeared.
Virtually unchanged Norscan inventories for July were greeted with enthusiasm in many quarters. The average rise in July is 147,000 tonnes and this year, the increase was a mere 5,000 tonnes to 1.785 million tonnes, based on an operating rate of 84.6%. The doom merchants who did not believe the industry capable of controlling stocks have been proved wrong, according to some sources who believe all that is needed now is a good Norscan result for August, and the market will be ready for a price rise in the fourth quarter.
The widespread attitude to such optimism was succinctly summarized by one supplier who said, ""One should never talk down somebody who's talking up the market,"" which is, of course, very different from agreeing with the viewpoint.
Firm signs of a recovery are absent as yet, and as one supplier put it, ""There is still a lot less paper being used than we would like."" The rate of decline of the FOEX pulp benchmark price of northern bleached softwood kraft and eucalyptus has slowed down and buyers are reportedly happier to put their names on bales of pulp now than they were a month ago. The result is a gradual shift in inventory from seller to buyer. Suppliers have made it clear that they are unwilling to go any lower on the price front just to get business. 
The motivation for price rises is particularly strong in Europe, as the improvement of the euro has changed the relatively strong position of the Euro-zone producers. As such, any increase would be dressed up as a ""correction"". But North American producers are also strongly motivated to raise prices as they are operating at uneconomic levels. The danger feared by many analysts is that suppliers, encouraged by dwindling stocks, will crank up their production again and put paid to any chances of a price recovery.
Certain short fiber producers from South America are reported to have abandoned the Italian market temporarily as price demands in the country have hit lows that these suppliers are not prepared to entertain. Uncertainty over the future of Indonesian short fiber supplies is also helping to shore up the hardwood supply position elsewhere.
The spot market continues to dwindle in importance and buyers reported they are receiving far fewer unsolicited offers of cheap pulp than earlier on in the mid-year vacation period.

SINGAPORE, Aug. 14, 2001 (Dow Jones)--Indonesian pulp prices have bottomed out, with further recovery expected in the fourth quarter, the Indonesian Pulp & Paper Association told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday.

"Asian spot pulp prices look to have bottomed out","SINGAPORE, Aug. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Spot pulp prices in China and Korea seem to have hit rock bottom and hardwood pulp prices are showing signs of rallying. Overall pulp buying is picking up thanks to the current low prices. Supply has tightened for several grades, but sources are wary of any optimistic prediction that pulp prices will surge upward by the end of the year.
The benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) grade is trading at $390-400/tonne on the Korean and Chinese spot markets. Prices slipped to as low as $380/tonne in early August, but have now begun to bounce back. Buying activity has firmed up in China in particular.
The upward price movement in NBSK has been held back by a flurry of radiata pine pulp shipments from Latin America to Asia though. Suppliers slashed the list price of radiata pine pulp to $370/tonne, a $40/tonne drop, for Chinese buyers in early August. The volumes supplied at this low price level were eaten up within the following few days and the next deliveries will arrive at Chinese ports after the end of September.
Given the extensive shipments to come, it is hard to see radiata pine pulp prices moving up in China until the end of the year, unless producers announce price hikes, according to one major trader in Beijing. The grade is selling at $370-380/tonne in China and Korea.
Russian bleached softwood pulp has maintained stable trading volumes in China. Prices are now almost on a par with radiata pine levels at $360-380/tonne.
In the hardwood sector, sales of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood pulp have been contracting due to a lack of supply. This has led to a buoyant market for Brazilian eucalyptus, which is changing hands for $380-390/tonne in the Chinese and Korean spot markets, up $10/tonne from last week.
But sources said that Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood pulp still plays a key role in the regional market. Paper mills are in the habit of using this grade. On top of that, once normal supply resumes, and as prices are $20/tonne below eucalyptus, many paper mills may decide to purchase Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood grade in the price-sensitive spot market, one trader said.

"India's ITC Bhadrachalam boosts bleached kraft pulp quality, capacity","paperloop.com
SINGAPORE, July 20, 2001 (paperloop.com) - ITC Bhadrachalam has unveiled plans to invest Rupee 2.5 billion ($53 million) in a new fiber line for its Serapaka mill, which is located in the southern India. 
The modern elemental chlorine free (ECF) pulp line will have a capacity of 300 tonnes/day of bleached kraft pulp. It will use a mix of wood and nonwood fibers, including eucalyptus, bamboo and subabul. Startup is scheduled for mid-2002.
Metso Paper will supply the fiber line including screening, brown stock washing, oxygen delignification and bleaching. The new line will replace two 20-year-old lines with a combined bleached kraft pulp capacity of 200 tonnes/day, but which cannot produce the high brightness pulp the company needs to manufacture high quality board. ""To match international competition and meet the needs of customers in India and abroad, we have to use high brightness ECF pulp for the products being made on our machines,"" a spokesman for ITC Bhadrachalam said.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Here's note that just came from Merrill on last Wednesday's Pulp numbers...I'll leave the choice between what is and what isn't important up to you...

Thanks!

Grim Pulp Outlook The situation in the pulp market is grim. Here are our comments on last week's statistics. A pick up in prices before next year is getting slimmer by the day. 
Last Wednesday, the Norscan pulp producer inventories came out, showing a decline of 84,000, compared to the 10 year average of 65,000 tons. The difference is immaterial, but it is impressive that the stocks fell at all because of the very low operating rates in the European fine pape rmarket, the key market for chamical pulp sold in the open market. With Nordic operating rates for June believed to have been lower than 70%, there was a much lower than normal pulp consumption. We may make one important observation, however. Maybe the smaller fine paper producers, all non-integrated, has continued to operate at 100%, and this may explain why Norscan stocks fell. Then the next question is: how long are the Nordic producers, and Sappi, going to be willing to give away customers to the price cutters? M-real, and yesterday Stora Enso, has announced HIGHER fine paper prices. This is just surreal. Keeping prices relative stable is a phenomenal achievement in it self, and if they manage, there will be a dramatic multiple expansion over the next year. 
Europulp, the pulp kept in European harbours, fell by 67,000 tons in June, to 1.36 million tons. This is the second highest figure during the 2 1/2 years this statisitic has been collected, and brings us back to the April level. A year ago, the level was 765,000 tons, and the stocks kept within a band of 600,000 and 900,000 from the start of 1999 (when our information starts) to November last year. So, in one way, this is good news, but we believe the stocks are still much too high. The little history we have show a small decline in June, but 2001 was better than the average. The Europulp stocks are owned by pulp producers (of which some is included in Norscan), traders (very little) and buyer (almost all of this would be included in Utipulp). We have to wait a few days for the Utipulp figures, but there is a small increase, historically, of 4,000 tons in June. The fact that the Norscan stocks fell 17,000 more than the Europulp figures suggest that the Utipulp stocks would have increased this year, too. 
Another reason for the declining Norscan figure may be found in Aracruz's 2Q figure. Thomas Souza, our South American colleauge, reports that Aracruz dramatically increased its sale to Asia. The reason was that the Chinese started buying pulp again in March/April. If they bought more eucalyptus pulp from Brazil, they would most likely also have bought a lot more softwood pulp from Canada and the US. Thus, Norscan shipment rates would most likely have been high, despite of the low fine paper production in Europe. The important point the Norscan figure is that the stocks still are way above 1.5 million tons level, where the inventories typically have to fall to in order to create pricing power for the producers. The stocks have fallen 225,000 since the seasonal peak in February, compared to a drop of 338,000 tons during the last 10 years. So, this was a bad spring. July and August typically see a seasonal increase in stocks, 230,000 on average over the last 10 years. There is no reason to believe that it will not increase this summer, too. As a matter of fact, there is a seasonal increase of 377,000 (implying a 29,000 per year increase in the stocks) tons in the Norscan stocks from June to February.
 The price is now very close to the cash cost for the high cost producers, and it is just a question of time before we get announcements of indefinite pulp mill closures. Then it's time to buy. However, we are starting to think that the pulp market may not recover before the start of next year. Not since 1978 have there been a recovery in the pulp price during the second half of the year, and at that time it started in 3Q ( In think all would agree that the possibility for a 3Q recovery is small), not Q4. Thus, every recovery in the pulp price during the last 23 years has either started in 1Q, or more often in 2Q.

Subject: Re: Foex Index; yr two e-mails


Hi Monika,

Welcome to the pulp and paper world.

In order to understand the index system, the first thing is to look at our
web-site www.foex.fi which includes a lot of information, particularly in
this case the FAQ section. You probably have taken a look at that already,
though.

Our two pulp indexes, NBSKP (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) and BHKP
(birch+eucalyptus) cover the European market. As abt 40% of the world pulp
trade is for the European market, these are, in a way, considered to be the
""world market prices"", particularly as the third biggest market, North
America (Asia is the second biggest) has virtually the same prices as
Europe; correlation between the two is well over 0.9.

The sellers reporting to us are, by definition, in NBSKP from Canada, US
West Coast and the Nordic countries. BHKP (birch, euca) sellers are from the
Nordic region, Latin America, Spain and Portugal and a number of
Asian/African companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market.
Buyers are European producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some
of their pulp from the open market, representing virtually all countires in
Western Europe. The split between birch and euca is approximately 30%/70%,
again reflecting the actual situation in the European market.

The exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received
from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some
are not. The producers reporting to us represent roughly 80% of the supply
to Europe in the two benchmark grades.

Most (=80-90%) of the pulp sold in Europe is so-called contract business.
This means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract
covering the grades and volumes, quantity rebates etc. However, prices are
fixed also for contract business on a monthly/quarterly basis. Most of the
pulp arriving Continental Europe or UK from abroad, goes through consignment
warehouses (in places like Antwerp, Rotterdam, La Pallice, Tilbury,
Savono-Livorno range etc.). As forwarding companies allow 30-60 days of free
storage, buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp,
delivered by sellers in large shipments, little be little by lorry, rail or
barge. Each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the
price reported to us, before customer specific rebates. Prices are for prime
grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following
month.

The following comments are worth making:
- Our system is based on first taking off top 10% and bottom 10% of the
prices received and only then calculating the index (or rather benchmark)
values. This way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well
as any theoretical attempts of manipulation (we have never detected any
attempts)
- We have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and
sellers. Some we receive through agents/merchants/trading houses - usually
mandated by a supplier to give us the price data
- If someone does not report their prices on a given week, we can use the
previous week's data but only once
- Prices are not volume-weighted (in order to avoid the manipulation
possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier
sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones)
- Prices are CIF European port before customer-specific rebates (again to
avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain
unchanged; also, rebates are often given only afterwards - e.g. when
exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold - and we cannot alter our indexes
retroactively)
- Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European
Community anti-trust regulators (=DG IV) and audited by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
- There is a group of independent experts, case need, as ""trouble shooters"".
Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the
index values.
- Participation is totally voluntary
- The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes
and Pulpex quotations include:
a) our prices are before customer-specific rebates (averaging 5-6%), Pulpex
prices are net
b) our prices are for contract business, Pulpex prices represent the lowest
spot-levels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market
c) our price info is based on actual sales, Pulpex prices are expectations
what the spot price might be in e.g. 3 month's time
d) our price is for a prime quality (within each benchmark grade there are
surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold) approved
by a seller from a particular supplier/mill, whilst Pulpex prices, based on
a delivery concept (i.e. you do not accept the price offered to close a
contract, you can make/take delivery), are prices in a particular inventory
location (3-4 alternative ones), sometimes far away from buyer's or seller's
normal ports for any lot (often unknown/unwanted grade, up to 11 months and
29 days old goods). This system tends to emphasize in the Pulpex system the
extreme prices, up or down, particularly in these early stages with low
liquidity.
- Our indexes are trade-marked products. Therefore their use for any
commercial purposes is possible only with our permission. To get that
permission, users pay us a small premium, the main source of our income.
Enron and FOEX Indexes Ltd. have a contract, Bob Crane has the details at
your end.

I trust this is helpful. I encourage you to contact us anew for any
additional questions.

Please find enclosed, for order's sake our pulp specs, some additional
comments we send to the price providers and the historical price series you
asked for (historical series are still without today's indexes, to be
published about an hour from sending this message; you can add those from
our web-site by the time you read this).

My best regards to you as well as to David and Elizabeth.

Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron
Industrial Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and
Elizabeth Hutchinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works.
Right now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX
index and the methodology behind it. I have seen one of the
presentations that you have presented in the States a while ago but I am
looking for a little bit more detail. For example, what kind of
companies you contact, what percentage of industry they represent in
terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, what geographic area
these companies represent and anything else that you think its important
to know.

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli

I just spoke to Karen and she said that we are not going to do the pricing newsletter. There is going to be only one newsletter published (the one I have been doing so far) but we have to format it. I'll call you later today.

"newsprint update, 10/29","Good Afternoon Team,

Belo issued its statistical report for the month of September.  Newspaper Group total revenues were down 10% in September on a pro forma basis. September 2001 had one more Sunday than September 2000.  Excluding the effect of the extra Sunday this year, Newspaper Group revenues were down approximately 16% . The Newspaper Group's revenue loss specifically related to the attacks was about $2 million.  At The Dallas Morning News, total full-run advertising linage, including preprints and supplements, was down 10.9% versus 2000.  Classified volumes were down 12.8%  with continued weakness in classified employment.   At The Providence Journal, total full-run advertising linage, including preprints and supplements, decreased 8.3 %.   Retail and classified volumes decreased 9.5% and 7.3 %, respectively.   The decrease in ad linage has decreased ad revenues to Belo -- which has negatively impacted Belo's total revenues.  Many publishers also find themselves in this weak position... and producers are struggling amidst sluggish newsprint demand.

"Finland's FOEX reports further erosion on NBSK price levels","paperloop.com
HELSINKI, Aug. 7, 2001 (Press release) - There was a further downward slide in the European contract business prices for northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) pulp. Most of the quotes for NBSK were in the $450-475/tonne range and the benchmark index dropped 2 percent to $459.82/tonne. 
Contract prices for bleached hardwood kraft (BHK) pulp including discounts have approached spot prices, which are beginning to inch upwards, especially in the Asian market. However, contract prices in Europe continued to move down, showing a 2 percent drop to Euro 449.08/tonne. The 0.7 percent strengthening of the euro against the dollar meant that the greater euro decline converted to $396.85/tonne, that is, the dollar index registered a 1.3 percent drop. 
Downtime announcements continue to flow in. In market pulp, including chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP), almost 1 million tonnes of supply reduction has been published. Also, European and North American papermakers have taken substantial curtailments in printing/writing papers as well as packaging grades.

"Tembec to shutter pulp mills in August","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 19, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Tembec Inc., the second-largest capacity pulp producer in North America, plans to shut down its mills for the month of August due to weak market conditions, said a company executive. Earlier, Tembec had announced it would curtail pulp production by about 100,000 tonnes in the third quarter.
""All of it (is market-related downtime), most is in August,"" said the executive, who indicated the firm would ?shut down cold' most of its facilities systemwide for the month. ""My customers are taking downtime and I in turn told them we will match their downtime. Our October 1 inventory will be the same as in '99 when the market was tight.""
Last week, an industry source noted that Tembec would take a month of downtime at its 227,000 tonne/yr northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) mill in Skookumchuck, B.C. With the closure in August, that mill will lose about 20,119 tonnes while Tembec's other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will trim about 16,926 tonnes based on capacity of 191,000 tonnes/yr. Tembec's NBSK downtime will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of its 3Q downtime. 
Tembec's third-quarter curtailments equal the firm's combined downtime on the year, with 55,000 tonnes trimmed from supplies in 2Q. But the executive said this quarter there were no plans to perform maintenance. 
""We have no traction in prices because the inventories (industrywide) are too high. Shutting down now is not going to cost us in sales. We have stock. Given that paper business returns to normal I will be able to run my business normal.""

Pulp Update: Inventory Rise in July Well Below Average; Goldman Sachs High
Yield Research; 8/14/01

Norscan pulp inventories rose just 4,000 tonnes in July, which is well below
the typical seasonal increase of approximately 150,000 tonnes.  Amidst all
the bad news about the pulp environment, this is good news.  Producer
downtime is certainly helping.  However, pulp prices remain quite weak, and
inventories of 1.78 million tonnes are still too high to allow for any
tightening of supply and demand in the short term.

We will distribute details of the July pulp report once they are available.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"FW: RISI pulp price methodology","

Subject:	RISI pulp price methodology

July 23, 2001

Dick, I know Elizabeth gave you a copy of a fax RISI sent her about their pulp price methodology. To supplement that fax I called Rod Young and he gave me the following information.

Over the course of the year they talk to about 30 buyers and 30 producers for their U.S. NBSK price (Table 5). This list represents about 80% of the sell side and 75% of the buy side.
However, in a given month their sample is much smaller. In a typical month they talk to 5-10 buyers and 5-10 suppliers, who probably represent 20-25% of the buy and sell side. However, Rod said if they get exactly the same price from the first three buyers and the first three sellers, they stop their interviewing at that time and use that price.
Their call list covers a variety of sizes of buyer and seller, from very large to very small. I couldn't get more details.
Regionally they talk to producers from all major regions including West, Canada and the South. They talk to buyers from all regions but the emphasis is on the northern and central U.S., where the largest focus of consumption is located. They believe their sample is reasonably well balanced according to where production and consumption take place.

Monika will be speaking to Timo Teras at FOEX to as similar questions about their methodology.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks,

Dave

Dear Team,  

I know that some of us have been regularly updating a file for Bob named ""Pulp-Newsprint-Corrugated"" on the O:/ drive.  Should we not do this anymore?  Stacey may want to use that file as a template for the new one...just an idea.

Thanks!

In the interest of giving Bob Crane regular weekly access to our major market numbers, could you please help out in the following way:

I believe you have a spreadsheet that contains your basic market data (production, shipments, consumption, producer ivnentories, consumer inventories, exports, imports etc.). In future, when you update this spreadsheet with trade association data etc., could you save it twice: once in your normal drive, and once in a new file that Stacey will create, to be called Bob and located in the Industrial Markets folder on the O: drive.

Thanks,

Dave

"newsprint update, 10/29","Good Morning Team,

Many US papers are planning ad rate increases in an effort to make up for lost ad dollars -- The Hartford Courant  plans a 3% to 4% boost in 2002, The New York Times' overall rates will likely increase 5% or so next year, while The Wall Street Journal's net effective general ad rate will be up 3.3%.  USA Today's general rate will go up 4%, as it has in recent years.  The Houston Chronicle plans to raise daily ad rates about 5%, only slightly below last year's hike, said Gary Randazzo, senior vice president of sales and marketing. ""While the downturn is significant now, ... we think that, because of the [federal] stimulus package, ... next year may begin getting back to some normalcy,"" he said, adding that advertisers may benefit from wider use of volume discounts.  Let's hope that advertisers are willing to pay, as ad dollars comprise a significant portion of newspapers' revenues...

Thanks very much! I'll check it out.

Monika, could you forward to me the file with your market pulp originator newsletter in it? Some of our originators would like to send it out of the company to potential counterparties, and I would like to look at the wording to make sure we can send it out: the wording for an internal document may be more frank and open than a document that's intended for external distribution.

Peggy, did I hear you say you got some legal language for a disclaimer for steel? I wonder if we can use that on the market pulp and other originator letters to make sure they can be used externally?

"Pulp spot prices have little room to fall in Europe","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The pressure has eased on hardwood spot prices in Europe as Indonesian hardwood pulps continue to slip out of the European market. 
This has been caused by factors such as higher prices in Asia, timber supply problems and environmental pressure. Eucalyptus is available on the spot market for $340-360/tonne, which, after discounts and rebates are taken into account, is little different to the regular transaction price of approximately $400/tonne. 
Spot prices for northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) are at $400/tonne at best, a price below which many North American producers fail to break even. There can be little room for spot prices to fall further. As is typical in a buyer's market, the distinction has blurred somewhat between regular and spot business, with many combined deals going on of regular tonnes topped up with spot.

"PPPC October Flash Report","Hello Team,

Please find the October PPPC Flash Report attached in the MS Excel file below.  Pablo Conde's highlights include:

*North American mills produced 11.9% less newsprint than in October of last year, resulting in an
85% operating rate.  If we exclude the idled capacity in Steilacoom WA (130 000 tonnes; mill
closed in December 2000) and Kenora ON (85 000 tonnes; PM#8 shut down in June 2001), the
operating rate would be 86%.

*Total North American newsprint shipments fell 12.3% year-over-year in October, due principally
to a 10% contraction in North American demand. Moreover, North American deliveries to
offshore markets registered a marked decline, falling off almost 25% from the same month last
year. Shipments to all the major markets fell, however Latin America accounted for more than
50% of the decrease. At the end of October, North American mill inventories increased slightly,
by 8 000 tonnes month-over-month, but remained 1% below the historical average.

*In October, total newsprint consumption in the US was 9.3% lower than the same month last
year, and US dailies consumption was down 10.8%. It should be noted, however, that
October 2000 counted 5 Sundays (as opposed to 4 in October 2001) and was the fourth strongest
month ever for newsprint consumption by US dailies. Inventories held by US dailies fell for a
third consecutive month, down 50 000 tonnes month-over-month, and stood at 38 days of supply
at the end of October. Since the end of February 2001 US dailies' stocks have decreased by
213 000 tonnes, or -19%. The most recent figures indicate that ad linage decreased 8.7% in
September 2001, for a year-to-date decline of 4.6%.

*At the end of October, total North American inventories (all mills and users) decreased by
41 000 tonnes from the preceding month. As a result, total North American inventories stood at
1.718 million tonnes, or 5.3% below the historical average.

The main belief is that prices have yet to reach the bottom, and it seems that this is going to happen in Aug-September.

Monika,

I guess given this week's index results versus the prior week's we can conclude that the pricing signals from the market are still mixed.

"Food Idea-Follow-up","Hello everyone,


As a follow-up to Vikram's note I was thinking of us getting together someplace and each bringing a potluck dish from our own respective countries or anything else that you want to cook, including desserts. 

What do you think? I am going to need some feedback on this in terms of when you want to do it, where, and what time? Then we can coordinate on who is bringing the main dish, salads, and desserts. 

I thought of this as a way of knowing each other better and sharing some cultural experince from everyones background.



let me know,
Monika

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"U.S. pulp prices slide again but market participants see a bottom","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Primary grades of North American market pulp declined last week as producers waited for their proactive downtime plans to take effect and many buyers easily talked down prices. Benchmark northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) fell another 4 percent, dropping $20/tonne to $480/tonne while other grades declined even further. 
Although many producers are moving to align supplies with moderate demand conditions, various sources said that softwood pulps in particular were still too abundant in the U.S and Canada. But over the short to middle term, market watchers appear less concerned with inventory levels and indicated that a cyclical bottom was very close. 
Some producer sources suggested that downward pressure had eased compared to last month. However, several buyers noted they had easily pushed down prices for most pulp grades. Effective list prices for southern bleached softwood kraft slipped $30/tonne to $430-$440/tonne on oversupply. But differential prices showed a slight anomaly as northern bleached hardwood kraft dipped only $10/tonne to $420-$440/tonne as the grade was said to be less abundant on the contract market. Suppliers also claimed its specialty uses allowed it to hold up compared to other grades. But southern bleached hardwood kraft (SBHK) prices saw the month's largest percentage drop, down 7 percent or $30/tonne to $390-$410/tonne. Still, market participants appear to be looking to the near term future with guarded optimism. 
Tuesday's North American/Scandinavian (Norscan) chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventory report may have been the first sign that producers have been able to control their stocks this year. Norscan inventories rose only 5,000 tonnes in July, well off an average July increase of 143,500 tonnes recorded over the past 10 years. 
Norscan stocks stood at 1.785 million tonnes at the end of July, representing 32 days of supply. Producers also held 32 days of supply in June. July inventories closed at 42.3 percent higher than year-ago results, a large improvement over the prior month's year over year 66.9 percent differential. 
""When you consider the downtime and how much production is being taken out of the market in the next three months, it's quite staggering,"" said a U.S.-based agent. ""Also, look at Asian and European buyers who are building inventories in anticipation of a bottom. There are some fundamental and psychological changes in the market (that will occur) in the next month as inventories are announced and downtime continues."" 
Guaranteed pricing offers. Both pulp sellers and buyers indicated there have recently been more attempts at guaranteed prices for anywhere from two to five months. A U.S.-based producer source said some buyers had proposed guaranteed prices for their contracted tonnes through the end of the year on concern of a sudden price rebound. 
Export markets showed mixed results. European prices again slid while Asian markets such as China and Korea appeared to level off. Consumer downtime continues to hit suppliers, but an Asian buyer said downtime at his firm's paper mills averaging a week per month were tempered by already low pulp prices. Hardwood pulps also appear to have leveled off there despite continued aggressive maneuvering from Brazilian producers that over the past few months have adjusted their prices to compete with Indonesian and other suppliers. 
In U.S. spot markets, NBSK pulp prices recently declined just over 2 percent compared to recent weeks, and apparently have come to mirror contract prices in non-Japan Asia. 
""NBSK spot prices seem to have bottomed out. List and spot prices are converging, which has always (signaled) a bottom,"" said Gordon Floe of NLK Consultants, who suggested that NBSK spot prices in the U.S. had already bottomed at $400/tonne weeks ago. ""But there is still a lot of pain for the producers in contract tonnage. Contract and spot needs to converge before a recovery will happen."" 
Prices for spot NBSK delivered in the Northeast or Midwest declined $10/tonne to $410-$440/tonne last week on paperloop's spot market price index. Recent paperloop spot prices represent a middle range of transactions, and closed 11.5 percent below August contract prices.

Stora Enso launches EUR 365M pulp line at Imatra, Finland, mill complex

10/01/2001 12:45:48, Press Release 


HELSINKI, Oct. 1, 2001 (press release) -- Stora Enso's Imatra mills form one of Europe's largest wood processing complexes, which now includes Europe's largest integrated pulp mill, following the inauguration of the new fibre line there today. The new line produces bleached birch pulp for the company's own paper and board mills. The main products of the Imatra mills are liquid packaging boards, boards for the food and drinks industry and fine paper. 

The new fibre line strengthens the Imatra mills' position as the only integrated manufacturer of liquid packaging boards and boards for the food and drinks industry. The mills produce all four different types of pulp required: bleached softwood pulp, bleached birch pulp, unbleached softwood pulp and thermomechanical pulp.

The new fibre line meets the latest environmental standards and optimises usage of raw materials. Water consumption has been decreased by dry debarking and the introduction of modern, efficient fibre production technology. Effluent discharges into waterways have been reduced. Odours have also been reduced by more effective recovery and processing of malodorous gases, which are utilised in producing the impregnation solution for thermomechanical pulping. The new production lines will be quieter, too.

Increased black liquor combustion will raise the proportion of energy generated from biofuels at the Imatra mills to 85%. 

In addition to the new fibre line, the former birch pulping line at Imatra has been modernized to produce pine pulp, and the bleached softwood pulping line at Kaukopaa has been shut down because it no longer met current production and environmental protection requirements. The project also included expansion of wood treatment, upgrading of the power plant and installation of a new pulp dryer. The total cost of the project was 365 million euros, and most of the new facilities were already in use in spring 2001....

Dave,

At a number of the pulp meetings we have had discussions around information we would like to gather in the marketplace.  Until now I had been erring on the side of smaller meetings to facilitate better discussion but I think it would be more helpful to have one person from fundamentals present at the pulp meetings on Mondays at 9:00.  This should be the person that is doing most of the work on pulp.  Please let me know who you think the best person to attend would be.

Thanks,
Rodney

"Spanish pulp, paper industry boasts 7.4 percent growth in 2000, shows potential for future growth","paperloop.com
BRUSSELS, July 23, 2001 (paperloop.com) - ""With a turnover of Euro 4,100 million ($3,491 million) in 2000, the Spanish pulp & paper industry is in full expansion,"" said Juan Villena, president of Spain's Association of Pulp, Paper and Board Producers (ASPAPEL) at the presentation of the association's annual statistical report. ""The industry is involved in several large-scale industrial expansion projects to increase capacity. The high level investments have increased paper and paperboard production by 1 million tonnes in the last five years,"" he added.
Spain is high in the ranking of pulp and paper producers in the European Union (EU), with 15 pulp mills and 132 paper and board mills.  Pulp production rose by 4.2 percent to 1.750 million tonnes.
In total, Spain consumed 6.824 million tonnes of paper and board in 2000, some 6 percent higher than the previous year, taking the total growth figure for the past five years to 32 percent. Despite the dramatic growth figures, Spaniards consume just 171 kg/capita of paper and board. When this figure is compared to the US's 347 kg/capita, German levels of 215 kg/capita or 245 kg/capita in Sweden, it is clear that Spain's pulp and paper industry has huge growth potential.
Home grown Pulp consumption rose by 11 percent to 1.578 million tonnes in 2000. Spain's pulp and paper producers sourced 27 percent of the wood and 17 percent of the recovered paper used as raw materials in 2000 through imports. The industry is working toward ways to source its furnish domestically though. To reduce Spain's raw materials deficit, both paper recovery and the harvesting of fast-growing species on wasteland need to be increased, ASPAPEL said. 
New technologies
Demand for printing/writing grades has leapt up by 31 percent over the same period to arrive at 1.957 million tonnes last year. The market has developed in tandem with the growth in demand for electronics and personal computers in Spain.
Household and sanitary papers
Demand for household and sanitary papers has risen by 35 percent between 1995-2000. Spain consumed 455,000 tonnes of these grades past year. Suppliers have fed the growing demand for tissue and sanitary products with the launch of new cleaning products and introduced new applications for personal hygiene and health goods.
Trade imbalance
Last year, Spain's producers exported 827,000 tonnes of pulp and 1.475 tonnes of paper. Exports accounted for 43 percent or nearly Pta 300 billion (Euro 2,164 million) of the overall turnover of Euro 4,100 million. The lion's share of exports went to EU countries, 89 percent for pulp. 
On the pulp side, exports dropped by 2.8 percent last year which came as a result of an 11 percent increase in domestic consumption. For every kilogram of pulp imported into Spain, the country exports 1.3 kg. Imports rose by 10.7 percent to 656,000 tonnes in 2000.Spain is one of the leading producers of eucalyptus pulp and domestic consumption of wood for pulp production stood at 5.564 million m3 in 2000. The fiber was sourced mainly from plantations of the fast-growing species, eucalyptus globulus and pinus insignis.

ABOUT SPOT PRICES
---------------------------------------------------- 

One important note: The pricing in this newsletter
and paperloop.com's Spot Prices Center should 
not be confused with contract pricing reported in 
Pulp & Paper Week and PPI This Week. Spot prices can 
vary dramatically from what most buyers in the market 
are in fact paying. The movement of spot prices does, 
however, provide some information as to the future 
direction of contract prices. The prices reported here 
reflect the market conditions in the week prior to 
their publication.

"RE: World market pulp inventories fall nearly 10 percent","

Subject:	World market pulp inventories fall nearly 10 percent  

The good news for the pulp producers continue as worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 345,000 tonnes in September from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. World inventories have fallen seven consecutive months as producers reduced their stocks 9.7 percent from opening levels.
World producer stocks closed September at 3.073 million tonnes, representing 33 days of supply and a four-day reduction from August levels. Producer inventory results are 19.4 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. The inventory results were by far the largest single month reduction this year. The year's prior high was in June, when producers brought down inventories by 171,000 tonnes but faced a bloated 3.528 million tonnes of stock. 
September production of 2.525 million tonnes tumbled 10.2 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.812 million tonnes. Production levels were 5.9 percent lower than the prior month. 
Global shipments improved both month-over-month and compared to the same period last year. Shipments of 2.870 million tonnes rose 2.8 percent higher than year-ago results of 2.792 million tonnes, and surged by 4.4 percent vs. August despite a slower week of activity following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Producers operated at 84 percent of capacity in September, down 11 percent from the same time last year when producers ran at 95 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced another 5 points to 95 percent, PPPC reported.

"Parsons & Whittemore takes pulp downtime in New Brunswick","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 23, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Parsons & Whittemore (P&W) began a two-week shutdown at St. Anne, its northern bleached hardwood kraft pulp mill in Nackawic, N.B., Monday due to market conditions. The outage will trim about 10,500 tonnes from the mill's supplies, or just over 16 percent of its quarterly capacity, a source at the company said.
The Rye Brook, N.Y.-based firm hadn't slated market-based curtailments this quarter but had planned about 14,000 tonnes worth of maintenance closures. The New Brunswick mill's downtime, which the source said could produce 750 tonnes/day of NBHK, brings expected third-quarter downtime at P&W to about 24,500 tonnes. 
A company official indicated that weak pricing conditions had prompted the shutdown. 
""We could sell pulp but we're not going to sell at the price,"" said the official, who added, ""We only ship to the U.S. Northeast by truck. There's no rail siding so shipping is more expensive. We have good, long-term customers there so we made sure we had ample inventory (before shutting down)."" 
Although much of St. Anne's pulp is used for photographic paper and other specialty uses, prices even for specialty grade NBHK have fallen deeply enough that freight costs have recently been more of a consideration for producers seeking to protect margins. 
A company source added that systemwide there were no further market-related downtime plans through August.

Paperloop has given us an estimate for the cost of giving us online access to their complete historical pricing database on an going basis. Essentially this would cover all products that are contained in any of the price tables in Pulp & Paper Week. 

Their quote is expensive so we need to think about it. We already have a fair amount of historical information, although many of their prices go back (monthly) to 1979 or 1980. And, of course, their data base includes some products we don't presently track. My question to you: Would this access make a significant difference to you in doing price analysis?

Avril: an alternate and very labor-intensive approach: I have almost all of the Pulp & Paper Weeks going back to 1979; we could ask a temp to key the data in out of the newsletters.

I mentioned the following idea to Vikram.  The Gispy Kings are playing out at the Woodlands Pavilion on August 26 (it is a Sunday)  and I was thinking it might be nice if we got together beforehand and had the potluck and then we could all go to the show, assuming their music is within everyone's taste and liking.  (Given the heavy weighting of the Latin contingent, I suspect it may be.)  Anyway, lawn seats are only $17, so it is also pretty affordable.  Dave and I both live out there, and I would be happy to host the potluck before hand in the afternoon at my house, or if Dave is willing we could make it a pool party,and get him off to a good start with all of his new neighbors by being really loud in his back yard.  Any thoughts?

PS  I'm out of town this coming weekend.

Elizabeth

Hello everyone,


As a follow-up to Vikram's note I was thinking of us getting together someplace and each bringing a potluck dish from our own respective countries or anything else that you want to cook, including desserts. 

What do you think? I am going to need some feedback on this in terms of when you want to do it, where, and what time? Then we can coordinate on who is bringing the main dish, salads, and desserts. 

I thought of this as a way of knowing each other better and sharing some cultural experince from everyones background.



let me know,
Monika

"newsprint morning update, 10/18","Good Morning Team,

The Orange County Register will eliminate 102 positions of the newspaper's 1,749 full time employees on Friday, as a result of decreased circulation and revenue due to weak advertising compounded by the September attacks.  As of March 31, the Register had a daily circulation of 353,334 and a Sunday circulation of 410,207, with an annual NP consumption of 120,000 MT.

Media General reported a 3Q01 loss -- its first quarterly loss in 4 years.  ``The terrorist attacks of September 11th had an immediate impact on our earnings, and they have exacerbated the economic uncertainty that has caused many of our advertisers to remain cautious,'' Chief Executive J. Stewart Bryan III said.  Revenues for 3Q01 were down 4% from the same period in 2000.  Media General's publishing division, which includes the Richmond Times-Dispatch and the Tampa Tribune, had a revenue decrease of  5.4%.

Sun Media eliminated 125 more jobs in cost-cutting measures intended to save $10 million annually.  The Quebecor subsidiary - publisher of such major dailies as the Toronto Sun and Le Journal de Montreal - announced it is combining the business operations of its Bowes Publishing division, which produces over 190 weeklies and community dailies, with those of its metropolitan dailies.  As well, it is ending production of its free Toronto commuter daily, FYI Toronto.  The end of FYI Toronto should provide some immediate relief to other Toronto dailies, such as the Toronto Star, and possibly increase demand for Toronto dailies...
October abounds with job cuts and 3Q01 losses... none of this comes as a surprise in light of the bleak ad market and the negative shock of the September attacks.  As a result, many publishers are looking to cut costs to recover from decreased ad revenues.  If you would like more information on a particular publisher, I would be happy to oblige.

"Sub-cost production to rescue European pulp market","BRUSSELS, Aug. 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The pressure of producing market pulp below cost is likely to provide its own outlet, according to a number of sources. Suppliers from North America's West Coast have been producing in the red for some time now and severe downtime will be forced upon them, providing the sharp slimming of inventories which is required for recovery. One supplier predicted, ""It won't be long before we get better prices and conditions.""
Suppliers in the southern states of the US and eucalyptus producers are suffering similarly unprofitable business. Southern pine is a rarity now in Europe, as the home market proves more attractive. And some South American eucalyptus producers have turned the supply tap off in Italy. But Italian activity has proved a reliable barometer for market direction in the past and it is the Italian buyers who are seeking fixed contracts for two to three months in advance now. This is reported to be spreading north.
There are rumblings in South America about a correction to the eucalyptus price. The weakened dollar means that Latin American eucalyptus priced in dollars is cheap compared with European volumes priced in euros. While producers are likely to wait at least until October for the market to see some post-vacation period momentum in the paper market, the intention is clear.
Major producers of northern bleached softwood kraft have indicated they intend to go no lower than $450/tonne, yet the possibility of $440/tonne in September was not dismissed by buyers or sellers. The FOEX benchmark is still slipping, albeit slowly, and there may be another $10/tonne to go before the absolute bottom is reached. This would drive out the spot market almost completely, in particular as prices in Asia are now at very similar levels to those in Europe. Pulp buying in Asia is said to have picked up thanks to the low prices. One supplier said, ""The spot market in Europe seems more or less to have disappeared.""
The effect of such low prices combined with any pick-up in woodfree paper sales could provide sufficient impetus for pulp prices to creep up again in the fourth quarter, according to one source. But he warned that if higher cost producers were encouraged by this to enter the fray at 100% production, it could pave the way for a rocky 12 months bumping along the bottom.
Norscan inventories are predicted to end August much as they did in July, which would be contrary to the trend for the month and set the scene for falling stocks in the fourth quarter, if demand picks up to anything like normal levels.

Market Pulp Prices Continue to Fall; Goldman Sachs High Yield Research;
7/16/01

This week's issue of Pulp & Paper Week shows an NBSK pulp price of
$500/tonne, down from $540/tonne last month and $710/tonne at the beginning
of the year.  As we wrote about last week, demand for pulp continues to be
very soft, with Norscan shipments down a whopping 10.6% during the first six
months of 2001.  This ties to lower demand for paper products as a result of
general economic weakness.

Norscan stocks are still too high, totaling 1.781 million tonnes at the end
of June.  Although pulp inventories typically rise during the seasonally
slow months of July and August, we are optimistic that increased amounts of
producer downtime this summer will actually improve the inventory situation
somewhat.  Producers have already announced 550,000 tonnes of downtime for
the third quarter, which equates to 9% of Norscan quarterly capacity.  The
extent of Q3 downtime will determine how quickly the pulp market can
stabilize and when pulp prices can begin to reverse this slide.

Our forecast is for an average NBSK pulp price of $580/tonne in 2001, down
from $685/tonne in 2000.

"Mexico's Durango ends labor row to reopen paper plant","paperloop.com
MONTERREY, Mexico, Aug. 30, 2001 (Reuters) - Mexican paper company Grupo Industrial Durango (Gidusa) said on Thursday it will reopen a plant in western Mexico after ending a four-month-old labor dispute.
 The plant of affiliate Compania Industrial Atenquique was closed in April due to high labor costs, representing 25% of production compared with 8-10% at other plants. The plant produces 132,000 tonnes/yr of paper.

Subject: Re: Foex Index; yr two e-mails


Hi Monika,

Welcome to the pulp and paper world.

In order to understand the index system, the first thing is to look at our
web-site www.foex.fi which includes a lot of information, particularly in
this case the FAQ section. You probably have taken a look at that already,
though.

Our two pulp indexes, NBSKP (Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft) and BHKP
(birch+eucalyptus) cover the European market. As abt 40% of the world pulp
trade is for the European market, these are, in a way, considered to be the
""world market prices"", particularly as the third biggest market, North
America (Asia is the second biggest) has virtually the same prices as
Europe; correlation between the two is well over 0.9.

The sellers reporting to us are, by definition, in NBSKP from Canada, US
West Coast and the Nordic countries. BHKP (birch, euca) sellers are from the
Nordic region, Latin America, Spain and Portugal and a number of
Asian/African companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market.
Buyers are European producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some
of their pulp from the open market, representing virtually all countires in
Western Europe. The split between birch and euca is approximately 30%/70%,
again reflecting the actual situation in the European market.

The exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received
from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some
are not. The producers reporting to us represent roughly 80% of the supply
to Europe in the two benchmark grades.

Most (=80-90%) of the pulp sold in Europe is so-called contract business.
This means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract
covering the grades and volumes, quantity rebates etc. However, prices are
fixed also for contract business on a monthly/quarterly basis. Most of the
pulp arriving Continental Europe or UK from abroad, goes through consignment
warehouses (in places like Antwerp, Rotterdam, La Pallice, Tilbury,
Savono-Livorno range etc.). As forwarding companies allow 30-60 days of free
storage, buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp,
delivered by sellers in large shipments, little be little by lorry, rail or
barge. Each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the
price reported to us, before customer specific rebates. Prices are for prime
grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following
month.

The following comments are worth making:
- Our system is based on first taking off top 10% and bottom 10% of the
prices received and only then calculating the index (or rather benchmark)
values. This way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well
as any theoretical attempts of manipulation (we have never detected any
attempts)
- We have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and
sellers. Some we receive through agents/merchants/trading houses - usually
mandated by a supplier to give us the price data
- If someone does not report their prices on a given week, we can use the
previous week's data but only once
- Prices are not volume-weighted (in order to avoid the manipulation
possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier
sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones)
- Prices are CIF European port before customer-specific rebates (again to
avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain
unchanged; also, rebates are often given only afterwards - e.g. when
exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold - and we cannot alter our indexes
retroactively)
- Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European
Community anti-trust regulators (=DG IV) and audited by
PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
- There is a group of independent experts, case need, as ""trouble shooters"".
Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the
index values.
- Participation is totally voluntary
- The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes
and Pulpex quotations include:
a) our prices are before customer-specific rebates (averaging 5-6%), Pulpex
prices are net
b) our prices are for contract business, Pulpex prices represent the lowest
spot-levels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market
c) our price info is based on actual sales, Pulpex prices are expectations
what the spot price might be in e.g. 3 month's time
d) our price is for a prime quality (within each benchmark grade there are
surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold) approved
by a seller from a particular supplier/mill, whilst Pulpex prices, based on
a delivery concept (i.e. you do not accept the price offered to close a
contract, you can make/take delivery), are prices in a particular inventory
location (3-4 alternative ones), sometimes far away from buyer's or seller's
normal ports for any lot (often unknown/unwanted grade, up to 11 months and
29 days old goods). This system tends to emphasize in the Pulpex system the
extreme prices, up or down, particularly in these early stages with low
liquidity.
- Our indexes are trade-marked products. Therefore their use for any
commercial purposes is possible only with our permission. To get that
permission, users pay us a small premium, the main source of our income.
Enron and FOEX Indexes Ltd. have a contract, Bob Crane has the details at
your end.

I trust this is helpful. I encourage you to contact us anew for any
additional questions.

Please find enclosed, for order's sake our pulp specs, some additional
comments we send to the price providers and the historical price series you
asked for (historical series are still without today's indexes, to be
published about an hour from sending this message; you can add those from
our web-site by the time you read this).

My best regards to you as well as to David and Elizabeth.

Hello Mr. Teras,

My name is Monika Causholli and I am a new analyst working at Enron
Industrial Markets concentrating in pulp. I work with David Allan and
Elizabeth Hutchinson whom you met in the conference in Las Vegas.

I am in the process of understanding the pulp market and how it works.
Right now I am working on a project where I have to analyze the FOEX
index and the methodology behind it. I have seen one of the
presentations that you have presented in the States a while ago but I am
looking for a little bit more detail. For example, what kind of
companies you contact, what percentage of industry they represent in
terms of tonnage, markets that they represent, what geographic area
these companies represent and anything else that you think its important
to know.

I would very much appreciate your help in the matter,

sincerely,
MOnika Causholli

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Asia sees mixed price developments","paperloop.com
SINGAPORE, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com ) - Market pulp trading is growing in China in line with the country's healthy economic growth, but it is slumping in Korea as a result of the country's weakening coated woodfree paper exports to China. Sources said that although buying activity is picking up, Chinese traders are keen to destock their full inventories, putting a stop to any upward moves for NBSK and radiata pine pulp prices. Spot prices for these two grades have stayed flat at $390-410/tonne and $370-390/tonne, respectively, since early July. 
Mill downtime and reduced woodchip supplies have impeded trading of Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood in Asia. But a flurry of Brazilian eucalyptus to the region has filled the gap. Indonesian mixed tropical hardwood prices have edged up at the lower end to $360-370/tonne, up from $340-370/tonne in mid-July. Brazilian eucalyptus prices also shifted up $10/tonne at the lower end of the range, taking prices to US$360-370/tonne. Sources reported that large volumes of pulp from Latin America were being shipped to China in July following orders placed earlier. These include Brazilian eucalyptus and radiata pine from Chile. Chinese buyers placed large orders for these grades when prices plunged in April.

"Monthly Exec. Report June printing & writing numbers","Hello MR. Conde,

As I told you over the phone there are a couple of numbers in June Executive report for Communication papers that do not match the numbers in the time machine. For example:

June Demand for Canada for Coated woodfree papers is 39 000 in the report whereas I get 41,296 from the time machine.
Also, for the Uncoated Woodfree the report says that demand is 72,000 whereas the time machine says 74,123.

Can you help me figure out which one is correct? Also, How much time after the Monthly Executive reports go out does it take before the Time machine numbers are updated?

thanks,

HEADLINE: 	Deferiet Paper mill in N.Y. to be reopened by new B.C. owner 	
ARTICLE: 	By James McLaren 

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 29, 2001 (Forestweb) -- Vancouver, B.C.-based Belkorp Industries Inc. has acquired the Deferiet Paper Co. mill in Upstate New York from bankruptcy court. A Belkorp official declined comment today until the transaction is completed. 

The new owner plans to reopen to idled mill to produce paper, either from existing wood pulp operations or recycled paper, according to local press reports. 

The deal comes four months after the mill closed down, and one month after an auction failed to produce any bids. 

The independent mill was formerly operated by Champion International. It has listed capacity of 225,000 tons annually of groundwood specialty paper. 

Belkorp plans to re-open the mill by next spring, and rehire between 100 and 200 workers, local press reports said. It previously employed more than 400. 

The news came after weeks of efforts to jointly market the Deferiet mill with other Upstate closed mills in Lyons Falls, N.Y., and Newton Falls, N.Y. 

Unemployment benefits were to run out soon for the former Deferiet Paper workers, who are members of the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union.

"Downtime, lower inventory keep prices relatively flat for U.S. uncoated papers","paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - While coated paper prices declined in July because of cheaper imports and flooded domestic inventories, uncoated papers, including free-sheet, have been spared a dramatic turn by industry-wide downtime efforts and inventory management. 
Even considering the increase in South Korean uncoated free-sheet and European uncoated mechanical imports, prices managed to remain relatively stable, dipping only slightly in what many producers and merchants are calling the most depressed market in over two decades. One forms bond manufacturer and one merchant both stated that, while business was ""lousy,"" prices were holding. 
However, spot market deals dramatically impacted rolls of uncoated 50-lb offset. Another trend in publishing spheres is downgrading from uncoated free-sheet to cheaper, uncoated white groundwood. Sources said that, although these groundwood alternatives do not meet all the specifications for permanence, they are being sold in increasing volumes by Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. and Alliance Forest Products Inc., which Bowater Inc. plans to acquire. 
The largest grade of uncoated free-sheet in production, demand, and sales is repro bond, yet reprographic paper takes an annual downturn in the summer months due to lowered office demand and school closures. End uses for the paper are in personal printers and/or photocopiers. Most merchants expect a swell in demand in August, when schools will actively bid. Another factor in the expected increase of repro usage is the decrease in heavier trade book and offset uncoated papers. 
Some paper manufacturers, praising North American mills in their choice to take downtime rather than discount across-the-board, felt that continental production has more of an impact on the domestic market than imports. From January to March of this year, the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) released figures that put uncoated mechanical exports 3.7 percent higher in the first quarter than year-to-date figures. 
Indeed, extensive downtime has been the saving grace of uncoated papers over the last six months, sources said. Beginning in the first quarter with exorbitant energy costs in the U.S. West, and continuing through the lack of demand in the second and third quarters, lost tonnage has saved manufacturers the costs of energy, freight, surplus inventory, and labor.

I am working with Christopher de los Santos and Fariha Haque in looking at some of the drivers for the pulp market to structure a Decster for pulp-- one thing that struck me at today's meeting was the looming threat of BEK.  I would like to get together with you to better understand the work you have done on the drivers as well as the view that we are developing for BEK.

<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<P>1) Can I pay the application fee in US dollars? I don't know if I can write a check in Euros. If&nbsp;yes, how much would it cost in US dollars?</P>

"Pacifica Papers to extend the downtime at its Port Alberni operations","paperloop.com
VANCOUVER, July 31, 2001 (PRNewswire) - Further to its announcement of July 5, 2001 that it would curtail production of approximately 8,500 tonnes of lightweight coated and telephone directory paper, Pacifica Papers Inc. announces that it has extended the downtime at its Port Alberni operations until August 5, 2001 to curtail production of an additional 5,000 tonnes. The extension of the curtailment will further enable the Company to maintain efficiency in the balance of inventory, order flow and machine capacity in response to weaker economic conditions in the key U.S. market.
Pacifica is a high-margin producer of value-added groundwood printing and communications papers including lightweight coated paper, soft nip calendered paper, telephone directory paper, machine finished hibrite paper, and newsprint. Pacifica's operations include two paper mill complexes at Powell River and Port Alberni, British Columbia, with a combined annual production capacity of close to 900,000 tonnes.

"RE: Correlations between NBSK price and paper grades prices","Karen,
 
When I asked MT about exp. smoothing she said that exp smoothing is used for smth else and not for correlations. She suggested though that I run the correlations between the changes in prices as that will remove the trends in data (if there is any trend) for a more accurate corr. coefficient. That is what I did in the spreadsheet. As a result correlation coefficients were much lower.
 
By the way, how is your son doing?

Hi Monika,
I had to ask you about the Pulp Industry. When you

Subject:	VCP snaps up Anglo American?s stake in Aracruz

SAO PAULO, Oct. 4, 2001 (Press release) Votorantim Celulose e Papel (VCP) announces that it has entered into an agreement to acquire, through one of its affiliates, a 28% voting interest (12.3% total interest) in Aracruz Celulose, the Brazilian eucalyptus pulp company. The stake is being acquired from Mondi Brazil, a subsidiary of Anglo American for a cash consideration of $370 million.
Raul Calfat, CEO of VCP, said, ""This transaction represents an important step for VCP in strengthening our position in the global pulp and paper markets. This also enhances our status as one of the lowest cost producers with outstanding services to our customers. We are very pleased with this opportunity which we believe will create substantial value for our shareholders.""
Andrew Thompson, chairman of Mondi Brazil, said, ""We evaluated the options for our investment in Aracruz and concluded that it was in the interests of our shareholders to sell our stake on these terms. We have valued being party to the development of Aracruz during our time as voting shareholders with board representation. We have been particularly impressed by the vision and leadership of Erling Lorentzen as founder and chairman. We are confident that VCP will be a supportive new voting shareholder and we wish both them and Aracruz success in the future.""

"Coated woodfree suppliers fight back in Europe","BRUSSELS, Aug. 30, 2001 (paperloop.com) - The European coated woodfree market has seen a welcome boost, with producers launching attempts to raise prices. M-real took the lead in July when it announced having started negotiations with customers to raise coated woodfree indent prices in Germany. The French market was the company's next target. 
Stora Enso has also kicked off talks to increase indent prices for coated woodfree paper. South Africa's Sappi said it has already managed to improve its indent levels in Europe. But the companies have remained tight-lipped on the amount of the increases. The success of the planned price hikes will be seen in September or October at the latest. Producers have backed up their efforts to raise prices with massive production curtailments.
Germany is reportedly a hive of activity, having been the starting point for the price negotiations. Merchants and producers have indicated that prices were set to rise in late August and September to pre-vacation period levels, market watchers said. Suppliers have been able to squeeze some of the increases through already. Prices for coated woodfree sheets improved by DM 50/tonne at the bottom end of the range in July, having dipped by DM 50/tonne in June. Prices for coated woodfree reels remained steady in June and July. 
French prices dropped by FF 100-200/tonne in July and levels slipped by a further FF 100/tonne in August. June saw no price movements, but some levels eroded by FF 100/tonne in May. One supplier to the French market indicated it will raise prices by around 5% in October. But at least one buyer gave the move the thumbs down, saying, ""I will not accept any increases.""
In the UK, coated woodfree reels slid by ?10/tonne in June and both reels and sheets fell by ?20/tonne in July. The UK market continues to be difficult for suppliers. One buyer indicated there has not been much buying activity in reels and as a result, some producers have tried to attract more business by lowering prices.
Italian levels have also weakened. In July, prices for coated woodfree reels slid by ITL 50-100/kg and offset sheets by ITL 50/kg. There have been rumors of offset sheets being offered at ITL 200/kg below regular levels on the spot market.
Soft demand has taken its toll on the coated woodfree sector across Europe. Several suppliers admitted that there has been a reduction in end-user demand. On top of that, the market became even quieter due to the mid-year vacation period. 
Dwindling advertising expenditure is one major culprit behind the lack of orders, along with the drop-off in dot.com initial public offerings (IPO). Advertising budgets have been cut and the need to print IPO information material has disappeared, as there have been fewer dot.com companies listing on the stock exchanges this year, market watchers said.
There is light at the end of the tunnel though, as some sources have already reported healthy order books for September. One player indicated that the market has reached the bottom, but said the burning question now is how long the market will stay there. 
The arrival of the euro in January 2002 is expected to boost demand, sources reported. Governments and monetary institutions will print leaflets and brochures on the adoption of the currency and a fair amount of these orders is about to trickle through to printers and producers.
Some papermakers are pinning their hopes on revived advertising budgets, as spending on this has a tendency to rise in the second half of the year. Although one printer said the current printing situation is ""very grim"", he expected the market to bottom out in August and then turn upward when the catalogue season kicks in during September.

"newsprint update, 10/23","Good Afternoon Team,
 
Not long after acquiring the mill as part of its merger with Alliance, Bowater will cut 300 of 1,000 jobs at the Coosa Pines mill in Alabama.  After posting weak 3Q01 results, Bowater is cutting costs.

For the 3Q01, McClatchy Co.'s  revenues dropped 5.5%, advertising revenues were down 6.5% from 2000 and circulation revenues declined 1.2%.  To keep costs down, McClatchy has reduced  the width of The Sacramento Bee's pages to save newsprint.  Its newspapers include The Fresno Bee, The Modesto Bee, The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., The News Tribune in Tacoma, Wash., and the Anchorage Daily News in Alaska.  As NA newsprint demand is already stagnant, let's hope other newspapers do not decrease their newsprint consumption.

I will be back in the office tomorrow afternoon.  Please call me at (832)721-3286 if you need anything.

Ayesha
