Bob,

I was going to write you to propose an alternative meeting venue, but my
firm has issued a stricter prohibition on all overseas travel and US
domestic travel (which stranded my colleagues who are already abroad on
business trips=they have to stay there until further notice). This is in
response to the anthrax incidents and the FBI's terrorism alert.

But, apart from myself, it may be worthwhile considering changing the venue
of the board meeting of November and January to countries that are not
actively participating in the retaliation.
Among the cities in which board members reside, places like Amsterdam,
Madrid, Paris and Milan may be safer. Perhaps we could consider Singapore
and Switzerland, too.

You are right that agendas for these two meetings are very full and
telephone conferences are not adequate. We should meet in person somewhere.
We could split them into several consecutive days' telephone conferences but
you have to get up early and we (including Azam and Steve) would have to
stay up late.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"We have resolved the BPA-James River contract","All,

I am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous James River contract with BPA under favorable terms.  The signed agreements are on my desk right now.  Besides significantly reducing our litigation risk, the addition of 7.5 MW/h and the change of delivery point have added $22.8 million to the value of the contract.

BPA and EPMI have amended the original contract to specify that (i) BPA will deliver 102 MW/h 24/7 for the 5-year term of the agreement (an increase of 7.5 MW/h over the original), (ii) the disputed ""alternative delivery point"" is designated as Mid-C, (iii) all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement, (iv) the parties agree to ""book out"" the James River physical deliveries against EPMI sales to BPA at the Mid-C delivery point (so no power will flow); and (v) we will continue to invoice BPA each month for the term of the agreement, just as if the power was still flowing.

Although my preference would have been to terminate the James River agreement, BPA refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates.  Similarly, I had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out, but BPA refused to do so because--according to BPA's finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring BPA to use mark-to-market accounting.  Therefore, we executed two documents:  one amending the original contract, and another called the ""Book-Out Agreement,"" which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years.  

I am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for EPMI because (1) we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point, which (2) will make it very difficult for BPA to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to James River, and (3) the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $22 million in value to the contract.  

Thanks to everyone for your help.

Steve

"Organization Changes","Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International

?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

"legal group - South America","Mark;

Today, Brett Wiggs told me that there will be a significant number of cuts on our Brazil staff (including Legal) within the next couple of weeks.  He asked me to think about a new structure to assist a small commercial team.  I asked about John Novak and he said ""he will probably end up being repatriated and you will become General Counsel"".  I was obviously a bit puzzled about his comments/questions and, since he was travelling to the Eletrobolt site today, I asked for some time before giving him any answers.  I wanted to know from you if this is something I should discuss with Brett Wiggs only, or you/Brett, or you/Brett/Novak, or ????

If the Brazil office remains open/alive focusing (primarily) on power marketing activities, I am sure that Karla Azevedo and I could handle all the business guys.  However, I anticipate that, within the next couple of months, there will be plenty of corporate work to be done in the near future such as Central Bank and Board of Trade matters (we would have to decide whether we keep Patricia Dutra in-house OR whether to outsource all corporate & institutional workload to outside counsel  -  I'd rather keep Patricia Dutra until everything is worked out well) as well as a lot of legal work to do on the Eletrobolt financing (where Luiz Watanabe and his trainee Aline Merone are focused).

I'd very much appreciate it if you could find a few minutes to provide me with your thoughts on the matter.  I know we are all going through heavy turbulence these days ...  sorry to bother you with this matter.

"Further Update--Enron Wind; Canadian Contract","Mark: To supplement my earlier email, I just got off of a t/c with Weil and some of our in-house attorneys (we have a daily call for the lawyers to catch-up); they advised that there is a hearing this week for expedited approvals (ie. before yearend) for the sale of certain Enron Wind partnership interests (Indian Mesa?) valued at about $190MM and our large PPA in Alberta, Canada. (I'm unsure of the value, although I thought I heard it was worth--at least at one time--close to $300MM--I think U.S.)  The Wind transaction is motivated by the expiring tax credits, while (I believe) the PPA impetus simply relates to the risk of declining value.  I'll keep you apprised.

"Upcoming Conferences and Recently Published Conference Proceedings","Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop 

And

Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference

January 22-25, 2002, New York City, NY

 

OVERVIEW

 

In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference

Feb. 5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida

OVERVIEW

 

This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

===========================================================================
PERCEPTIONS TOWARD ENRON HAVE TUMBLED FAR BELOW REALITY
Perceptions toward Enron have fallen as dramatically over the past 18
months as we have seen for any major company.  However, the major
disconnect is that unlike many technology and other (former) high growth
companies, Enron continues in our view to be the far-and-away best-in-class
company in its major business segments, and to have company-making growth
prospects, with a high probability of success, in huge new markets.  Only
18 months ago Enron was perceived as a company that could do no wrong.
It's wholesale marketing operation (currently 77% of earnings) was viewed
as having virtually limitless potential and its retail marketing business
was just beginning to emerge as a business that could even surpass
wholesale.  Management presented its telecommunication strategy to Wall
Street in January 2000 to great fanfare.  It was this raising of
expectations to (in hindsight) unreasonable levels and management's failure
to reset expectations for telecommunications when this business clearly was
falling far short of the objectives set by management that set the stage
for investors to lose trust in management and to discount other statements
because disclosure and transparency of information was so limited.

PERCEPTIONS HAVE HIT BOTTOM AND ARE LIKELY TO TURN WITH COMING DISCLOSURES
We believe perceptions have gone to such a negative extreme that a major
uptick is likely in the near and intermediate term given actions we expect
to be taken by management and new disclosures we expect with the Q3 report
and at year end.  We are decreasing our previous price target from $63 to
$48, still representing 57% appreciation, based on an 18 multiple of
forward earnings; we see this target as one that could easily be exceeded.
We view the current period as an extremely rare opportunity to purchase
shares of a company that remains extremely well positioned to grow at a
substantial rate and earn strong returns in the still very young and
evolving energy convergence space.  We do not intend to totally dismiss the
concerns of investors and even certain of the negative stories that are
circulating about Enron.  Some appear to have validity.  However most
appear to us to represent major exaggeration or misinformation to an
extreme; even these are difficult to effectively debunk given Enron's
limited financial disclosure.

WE SPOKE RECENTLY WITH MOST OF TOP MANAGEMENT; OUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS HIGH
We spoke recently with top management including the CEO, CFO, Chief
Accounting Officer and the head of Wholesale Services.  We challenged top
management on the wide range of accusations and concerns that have been
repeatedly bandied around by investors and have weighed heavily on the
shares.  We are convinced that the great bulk of the negative stories being
told about Enron are false or without substantial merit.  Most others
appear exaggerated in their claims.  We strongly believe that ENE shares
have fallen to discount these worst fears of investors and that as they are
debunked in coming months, as we fully expect, that the shares will rise
substantially.  We will review the major concerns that investors have
expressed and present our response/conclusions:

Market Speculation:  Enron uses fair value accounting and has 'created' the
bulk of its earnings in recent years by writing up assets to market (and
above market in today's world) and now faces huge charges as it attempts to
sell these assets.
Response:  Enron does use fair value accounting, but only in its merchant
investment portfolio.  This portfolio totaled as much as $2 billion at its
peak and is currently valued at approximately $1 billion.  Earnings and
losses from this portfolio have appeared in the asset and investment
category of Wholesale Services, the (by far) smallest piece of Wholesale's
earnings in recent years.  Any net gains in our view have been a modest
portion of earnings over the years and a negative in 2001.  This criticism
of Enron's past earnings, which some have used to discount past and current
levels of earnings as proper numbers to use to value the company, appears
to be totally off base.  We believe that some small portion of past
earnings can be categorized by investors as non-recurring, but that the
great bulk of past earnings are real and recurring and the proper starting
point in forecasting future earnings.

Market Speculation:  Enron has indicated that many billions of dollars of
assets that earn low returns are for sale and investors are concerned about
major write-offs that some believe could run in the billions of dollars.
Response:  Management does not deny that certain assets when sold could
incur losses.  However, others are likely to be sold at gains.  No assets
on the balance sheet are classified by accountants as impaired, which would
require that write-offs be taken.  Rumors of an $850 million charge at the
company's Dabhol, India power project appear far off base and we expect
Enron to suffer no loss given its strong contract position.  Although
certain Brazilian assets could be sold at losses, Enron does not have the
problem of having financed the Brazilian assets with U.S. debt; all were
financed with local currency.  We doubt that major charges are likely on
any assets to be sold and expect management will better define this issue
on October 18th with its earnings release.  Concerns of multi-billion
dollar charges in telecommunications and elsewhere also appear grossly
inaccurate.  The sale of various assets including the long awaited sale of
Portland General will likely create substantial cash proceeds (close to
$1.5 billion of net cash proceeds from the PGN sale alone) which will be
accretive to earnings almost regardless of how the proceeds are used (we
expect debt paydown and share repurchases).  Enron is committed to selling
some billion of dollars of assets over the next two years.

Market Speculation:  Capital requirements are substantial in the company's
marketing operations and both customers and competitors are concerned about
credit exposure to Enron.
Response:  Moody's upgraded Enron's credit earlier this year to BAA1 and
rating agency discussions have been routine according to management, given
Enron's best ever funds flow ratios.  Management indicated that speculation
of certain counterparties not extending credit are 'absolutely false.'

Market Speculation:  Cash flow from operations has lagged earnings and the
company has been a consumer of cash.
Response:  Management indicates that it will be cash positive in the second
half of 2001 and in future years.  This is perhaps the most difficult or
inpossible claim to confirm.  Management claims that margin activity
distorted cash flow in 1H01; in 2000 there was $1.8 billion of customer
inflows to cover margin requirements and in 1H01 $2 billion of deposits
were returned.  Enron has made many billion of dollars of investment in
past years as it sought to build its various businesses.  Financial
discipline did not appear in the past to be a top priority as the company
spent whatever it took to rapidly build its industry leading capabilities.
It now appears that financial discipline is dramatically improved at Enron.

Market Speculation:  A. California generated huge profits for Enron.
               B. California represents substantial potential liabilities.
Response:  This is another difficult topic to prove or disprove.
Detractors can (and have) made many unsubstantiated claims.  The recent
agreement for SoCalEdison to avoid bankruptcy appears to confirm the
validity of contracts and likelihood of Enron being paid for past power
sales.  Enron earlier identified nearly $600 million of receivables and has
indicated, similar to other convergence companies, that it has recognized
limited profits in California and has created substantial reserves.

Market Speculation:  Disclosure is sketchy.  The company must be hiding
something.
Response:  Enron had substantially more complete disclosure a decade ago
when it was forming its natural gas business and found that competition
intensified and margins were held down as competitors took advantage of the
information.  Management has steadily reduced the disclosure of information
even as the company's businesses and its products have become dramatically
more complex.  Investors have begun to call Enron's earnings a 'black box'
as they began to doubt their ability to analyze and predict future
earnings.  When management began to lose credibility with investors this
turned into a total loss in confidence in reported and potential future
results, a very high price to be paid.  Enron management is now committed
to improving disclosure, even at the expense of competitive issues.  (The
number of true competitors has already declined dramatically).  We expect
some additional disclosure with the Q3 report, but substantially more
beginning at year-end as management now recognizes the cost in ENE share
price of the limited disclosure and loss of confidence.

Market Speculation:  Recent 10K and 10Q disclosure of transactions may
require substantial new share issuance, given the current weak share price,
that will appear in fully diluted shares.
Response:  These shares represent collateral to backstop off-balance
transactions.  Net exposure and the transactions themselves are not well
defined and disclosed.  Management has indicated to us that the company is
working to restructure these transactions and that investors will see
results on this score 'fairly soon.'

Ken,

I don't know if you are the right person for this - but I thought that someone should register Enron in the new domain(s) asap before we lose them.

Although I am in IT, I am not really in the right area and neither is my direct chain of command (although I think they are just great to work for)

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1569000/1569222.stm

Sorry to have troubled you, but I KNOW that if I mention it, then you will get it to the right person for consideration.

Many thanks

Andrew Henderson

"David Mengle","I am delighted to announce that David Mengle will be joining us this coming
Monday, November 26, as Head of Research. In this newly-created position,
David will be responsible for providing research and analytical support for
our various committees and initiatives. In particular, he will work on
aspects of our risk management activities, providing technical assistance on
issues surrounding the Basel capital accord. He will oversee our market
survey and will work with those committees (operations, collateral) and
related staff members that produce surveys in other areas. Finally, he will
continue his involvement in our conferences, working with Mary and her group
to develop ideas for other training seminars. I encourage you to use David
as a resource whenever you believe that his analytical skills would be
useful in supporting committee activities.
 
David has a Ph.D. in Economics and was most recently with Rutter Associates,
the consulting firm started by Charles Smithson, a former ISDA Board member.
Prior to that, David was with J.P. Morgan and worked on a number of policy
and capital related issues. He brings to ISDA a great deal of industry
experience, as well as a wonderful, quirky sense of humor, and I am sure you
will all enjoy working with him.

"NETCO","The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Subject:	RE: Requests for Jim Derrick's signature on financial documents 

Kate:  Your memo is timely (and appreciated!).  Jim and I and the other general counsels discussed this topic this morning at Jim's weekly general counsels meeting (Jim and I are receiving a ton of these type of documents).  With respect to subsidiary financial statements requiring Jim Derrick's sign-off, the internal accounting officer and the internal lawyer representing the subsidiary company must initial the documents Jim is being asked to sign;  they are then sent to me (I also initial anything that Jim signs that relates to Arthur Andersen, per Jim's request).  Jim and I are not CPAs and we have little to do with the day-to-day operations of most of these companies, so that is the reason for all the diligence.  It is the responsibility of the general counsel of the subsidiary operation whose financial statements are being audited by AA to ensure that the proper review and initials are on these documents before they come to your group or mine----if not, we send the documents back to them to get the necessary initials.  If you have any problems with anyone who delivers these documents to you, let me know and I will be happy to educate them about this policy.  Bottom line for Jim and me:  We have little knowledge or expertise when it comes to the preparation of the financial statements of these companies, and we are relying on the expertise of our internal accountants who are involved in such preparation----they need to take ""ownership"" by initialing the documents.   Thanks for your help?.I hope these procedures don't make your job any harder than it already is!.   Regards, Rex.

Mike McConnell and Enron Community Relations is challenging Corp, EES, EGS (which includes ETS and Global Assets), and EWS to win the Race to Cure Diabetes.  

Which business unit  will sell the most shoes?

To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain or contact Janice Riedel at x37507.  The donation will represent a $10 contribution (with the company match) toward the research foundation.  Your shoe will be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26th.  Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Researchers are closing in on finding a cure.

The Cure for Juvenile Diabetes is within walking distance.

          Janette,
          With reference to our telephone conversation of last Friday, I talked to Jaime Alatorre.
           He will not be  able to be with Mr. Haedicke tomorrow Tuesday Oct. 16 at 2:00 o'clock, as he already had made an appoitnment.
           He mentioned that maybe the best time would be after finishing the staff meeting. (He thinks Mr. Haedicke will
           also be in the same meeting).
          Do you think they could meet tomorrow at around 5:15 pm.?
          If this is not possible, he will talk to you later, as he is out of the office in a Seminar this morning. 

          Thank you, Ma. Elena

Southern California Edison Averts Bankruptcy 



By Bob Bellemare
Vice President 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/r_bellemare_photo.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and Southern California Edison (SCE), the utility unit of Edison International (NYSE: EIX), said they have reached an agreement that will enable the utility to ""pay off its creditors and prevent another utility bankruptcy in California."" The CPUC also rejected the state's plan to issue a record $12.5-billion bond to fund some of California's power purchases. 

Analysis: In a striking move, SCE has reached agreement with the CPUC on a plan to keep the company out of bankruptcy. SCE accumulated a $3.9-billion debt buying electricity on the wholesale market at prices far greater than it was allowed to recover under a rate freeze imposed by deregulation. 

The key elements of the plan include a rate freeze and an agreement by SCE to not pay shareholders a dividend until the debt is paid off. SCE's rates were raised by approximately 42 percent earlier this year and will remain frozen through 2003 unless its pays off its debts sooner. In exchange, SCE agreed it will: use cash on hand and any revenue beyond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pay off its old debts; pay no dividends on its common stock through 2003 or until its back debts are fully paid; and drop a lawsuit against state regulators claiming the CPUC had violated federal law by failing to raise retail rates to reflect the underlying cost of wholesale power. 

Wall Street was quick to react favorably to the plan, as SCE's parent company stock (NYSE: EIX) rallied to its highest level in 10 months. Edison's stock rose $1.95 to close at $15.70, and shares of California's largest electric utility, Pacific Gas & Electric parent PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG), advanced $2.54 to $17.59. PG&E, who chose to declare bankruptcy earlier this year, said in a statement: ""Anything that would return utilities to financial health is a positive step in bringing stability to the state's year-long energy crisis."" However, it pointed out that the framework of the settlement appears to ""be remarkably similar to the rate stabilization plan that it and Edison proposed to the CPUC nearly a year ago."" ""The relative ease with which this agreement appears to have been reached in the past few days suggests that the upheaval and damage of the past year might have been avoided."" 

Shares in energy merchant firms selling power in the California market also rose sharply Wednesday as investors gained confidence that these firms will now get paid for their prior electricity sales to SCE. Gainers included Mirant Corp. (NYSE:MIR), which was up 11.98 percent or $2.72 to $25.42; Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE), up 7.9 percent or $2.42 to $33.03; and Calpine Corp. (NYSE:CPN), up 11.19 percent or $2.94 to $27.72. 

Consumer groups blasted the settlement, calling it a bailout that froze SCE's electric prices at artificially high levels. Mike Florio, senior attorney for the consumer group Utility Reform Network, argued that the settlement actually has ""unhealthy implications for consumers."" While the state legislature ""refused to force consumers to pay for the bailout they were considering, the CPUC is insisting that small customers bear the brunt of Edison's problems,"" he said, noting that consumers will pay inflated rates indefinitely. 

Gov. Gray Davis was also supportive of the agreement stating it ""protected the public interest and will allow the state's second-largest utility to return to financial health,"" adding that he welcomed the CPUC's assurance this could be accomplished without raising electric rates. The governor canceled a special Oct. 9 legislative session he had called to solve SCE's financial problems. 

The governor, however, had harsh words concerning an earlier vote by the CPUC that rejected the state's bond plan to finance electricity purchases made by the state's Department of Water Resources on behalf of utilities. California's bond plan, was defeated in a 4-1 vote, driven by concerns that the plan was too costly and would surrender the commission's authority to regulate power prices. The agreement would have allowed the state's Department of Water Resources to decide the ""reasonableness"" of power rates, traditionally a CPUC responsibility. Commissioner Henry Duque said this would ""set a dangerous precedent"" and lead to the ""dismantling of the CPUC."" ""The Department of Water Resources was not meant to be a bloated power bureaucracy"" and the rate agreement would do this, said Commissioner Richard Bilas. 

The state of California must now go back to the drawing board to find a way to sell the record $12.5-billion bond. State Treasurer Phil Angelides said he cannot sell the power bonds until the CPUC ""takes the actions required to implement the law. The CPUC's refusal to take action means there is no schedule for the bond issuance and no plan in effect as of today to repay the state's general fund."" Angelides warned that the state faces a budget deficit of over $9 billion in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if the bonds are not sold before July 2002. Gov. Davis said the vote ""was an irresponsible act. It creates uncertainty about our ability to sell the bonds necessary to repay the general fund when California can least afford additional fiscal uncertainty."" 

The four commissioners voting against the bond plan all favor a bill that was authored by state Senate Leader John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat, on grounds that it is more flexible and less costly. But the bill, already passed by the legislature, is opposed by Gov. Davis, who has vowed to veto it when it lands on his desk. 

True to its word, Southern California Edison has found a way to avert bankruptcy. This is a major milestone in the restoration of California's power business. But challenges remain for the state. PG&E remains in bankruptcy, the state is saddled with a $12.5-billion debt that it must find a way to finance, and wholesale electricity prices continue to lower making the state's decision to enter into very long-term contracts for electricity supply very questionable. Ironically, California began its deregulation efforts on the hopes of lowering electricity costs, which at the time were some of the highest in the nation. Now, the state is locked into even higher prices, as SCE's interim-rate increases averaging 4 cents/kWh are permanent for the foreseeable future.

Some Reasons Why Duke Energy
Was Named Company of the Year



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from PR Newswire] Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) was named Energy Company of the Year at the 2001 Financial Times Global Energy Awards ceremonies held last week in New York. The awards, sponsored by publishing and information company Platts and the professional services firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, recognized Duke Energy for its diversified operations and its successful overall growth during the past year. 

Analysis: 2001 may turn out to be the most tumultuous year in the history of the energy industry, and certainly the most volatile since deregulation began about four years ago. However, in the course of a year that has witnessed the bankruptcy filings of two leading energy companies (Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Enron), Duke Energy's success during the same time frame is all the more impressive. In addition to earnings that consistently meet or exceed expectations, Duke has carved out a unique niche in the energy merchant space, the same market in which its competitor Enron has now failed. The pending acquisition of Vancouver-based Westcoast Energy should also add to Duke's already-diverse portfolio, give it a lock on Canada's seemingly abundant gas reserve fields, and expand the company's North American pipeline capacity. However, in my estimation, the real significance of Duke's performance is the strategy that is working behind the scenes at this company. While more energy companies continue to announce massive restructuring plans-dividing up their regulated and unregulated businesses-Duke remains intact. Further, while other companies become more focused on a primary fuel source (natural gas, coal or nuclear), Duke remains broadly diversified. What this means is that, once again, Duke Energy is bucking trends and doing things its own way. Instead of following a growing trend of becoming a pure-play company, Duke continues to play its card as a multi-focused operation, which it claims may be its secret weapon in a volatile market. 

First and foremost, Duke's stats remain very impressive in a market terrain that has become rather bleak. The company has consistently maintained a market capitalization of $28.6 billion, a book value of $16.11 and P/E ratio of 13.86. In addition, while Enron's stock has languished below the $1 mark, Duke shares are currently priced at $36.81 (as of early morning trading on Dec. 10), and recorded a 52-week high of $47.74. For the third quarter 2001, Duke reported a 46-percent increase in ongoing earnings per share, or $1.02 per share. Year-to-date earnings per share from ongoing operations as of Sept. 30 were $2.30 compared to $1.63 for the same period last year. For year-end 2001, Duke remains committed to delivering earnings growth within a stated guidance of 10- to 15-percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of $2.10 in 2000. Looking ahead to 2002, Duke Energy expects to earn toward the high end of the 10- to 15-percent range. 

In addition, Duke presently owns and operates nearly 30,000 MW of generation worldwide (putting it on par with or very close to other generating companies such as AEP and Exelon), and reportedly trades eight times as much power and five to six times as much natural gas as it owns, operates or controls. Duke also claims that it transports 8 percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States as a whole, and 26 percent of the natural gas consumed on the East Coast. Also, Duke has some 12,000 miles of natural-gas pipeline in operation, 900 miles under construction and 450 miles in development. 

Responding to the newly bestowed award, Duke's CEO Richard Priory said, ""This award recognizes the business strategy of Duke Energy, which has remained focused on creating customer and shareholder value during a turbulent year in the energy sector."" This statement is significant because, perhaps more than Duke's strong numbers, the company's business strategy is arguably what gained it the enviable designation as ""company of the year."" According to Priory, Duke is attributing its financial success and strong projections for the future to its diverse portfolio and decision to remain an integrated company. In other words, all of Duke Energy's various business operations-including ownership of natural-gas and power assets, storage and transportation positions, and financial and physical trading-all stand as business units under the parent organization. Duke apparently has no plans to spin off any of its high-growth operations into a stand-alone operation. In fact, Priory maintains that ""combining our slate of power generation and gas-pipeline assets with trading capabilities and structured origination allows us to prosper through the ups and downs of market cycles."" 

Priory previously expressed that ""Duke is positioned to sustain its growth trajectory by leveraging the volatility that so many [other companies] fear."" It is becoming more and more uncommon for a company to remain as broadly diversified as Duke Energy, with regard to owning natural-gas pipelines and generation assets and operating an active trading strategy. Indeed, Wall Street presently seems particularly skittish about energy companies that have their fingers in various business sectors, and seems to prefer companies that become more focused on one operation in which they can excel. When referring to the pure-play strategy, Priory has previously alluded to companies that focus exclusively on generation or trading, and how he believes that approach carries a higher risk proposition than Duke's more diversified strategy. 

The other trend that is so common with energy companies right now is corporate restructuring to split off regulated and unregulated units in an attempt to realize greater value for both. The list of companies following this strategy is becoming longer all the time, but already AEP, Reliant, Southern Company, UtiliCorp, and Xcel have announced (or completed) massive endeavors to construct an operational wall between their regulated and unregulated businesses. In some cases, this has led to spinning off the unregulated business into its own stand-alone company. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Duke remains a holding company with various business units all integrated into one business model. As of spring 2001, Duke had structured its operations into seven business segments: 

North American Wholesale Energy (including the company's merchant generation portfolio); 
International Energy (comprised of Duke Energy International, with businesses in the Asia Pacific, Latin America and European regions); 
Field Services (including the company's natural-gas midstream, gathering and production businesses); 
Natural Gas Transmission (comprised of the company's natural-gas storage and pipeline businesses); 
Franchised Electric (Duke Power, the electric utility serving two million customers in North Carolina and South Carolina, and Duke Electric Transmission); 
Duke Ventures (including Crescent Resources, a real estate operation, DukeNet Communications, a telecom outfit, and Duke Capital Partners, which is essentially an investment banking firm); and 
Other Energy Services (including DukeSolutions, a C&I commercial energy services unit, Duke Engineering & Services, an energy engineering and technical services unit, and Duke / Fluor Daniel, which is involved in power plant engineering and construction). 

It should be noted that, at least until the Enron debacle, there have been downsides to this approach. First, investors may continue to be less likely to support a fully integrated operation that is broadly diversified, preferring instead to invest in companies that are more clearly focused. As noted, investors generally now support pure-play strategies and may seek out energy companies that have a very narrow and targeted business model. Second, on a related note, in an integrated company the success or failure of one business unit will have a direct impact on all of the other units. Without separating its operations, Duke could face a situation in which struggles in one particular area (telecom, for instance) could impinge on earnings in an unrelated, but connected, business unit. The bottom line for Duke may be that these potential risks pale in comparison to the advantage that the company believes it has over competitors in keeping its diverse operations integrated. 

As a final note, it is important to establish the role that Duke's $8.5-billion pending acquisition of Westcoast Energy most likely will play in its continued success, and its role in the reasoning for Duke being anointed as company of the year. From my perspective, one of the most important aspects of Duke's purchase of Westcoast Energy is the control over natural-gas pipelines that Duke gains in the deal. Upon completion of the deal, the combined entity reportedly will have 58,000 miles of gathering pipeline; 84 gas-processing facilities; 19,000 miles of gas transmission; and 16,500 miles of distribution pipeline. The purchase of Westcoast Energy, which includes a substantial amount of energy infrastructure in Canada, should help Duke to supply fuel to its current power plants in the United States and ones that the company has planned for future construction.

Shell Foresees the End of the ""Hydrocarbon Age"" 



By Jon T. Brock
Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence 


  <https://www.secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/j_brock_photo.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Big Oil must prepare itself for the end of the hydrocarbon age as alternative energies win over consumers in coming decades, chairman of the world's No. 2 energy firm Royal Dutch/Shell said on Wednesday. Oil giants from the last century will have to look to their laurels if they are not to be unseated as motorists move toward hydrogen-powered vehicles, and renewable energies, such as wind or solar power emerge Shell Chairman Phil Watts told reporters. 

Analysis: It seems that ""Big Oil"" is beginning to look at scenarios that have alternative energy sources to oil and gas. At least two of the three ""Bigs"" are prominently playing alternatives into their long-range planning. British Petroleum (BP) has an aggressive campaign on alternative energy sources, while others like Exxon have continued to be focused solely on oil and gas. 

Wednesday in New York, Watts spoke to reporters about Shell's scenario planning. This long-range outlook of world energy has oil shrinking from 40 percent of the world's energy source to 25 percent by 2050. Oil will still be the leader, with gas coming in at 20 percent in 2050. However, it is still quite a drop. 

From Oil to Gas 

""One thing I am convinced of is that the next 50 years is not going to be more of the same. An energy company had better make sure it has the necessary expertise and knowledge,"" Watts said at the launch of Shell's 'Long Term Energy Scenarios'. Referring to one of Shell's scenarios, Watts said, ""We could see an evolutionary progression, the so-called carbon shift, from coal to gas, to renewables, or possibly even to nuclear."" 

One could argue that the U.S. is already seeing the shift from coal to gas. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has estimated that at the forecasted rate of electricity consumption, 1,300 new power plants will be needed over the next 20 years. The majority of these plants are fueled by natural gas. According to the energy profile of the U.S. released by the EIA in April of this year, the U.S. has proven natural-gas reserves of 167 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 3.2 percent of world reserves, and currently consumes natural gas at a rate of 22.8 Tcf per year. From a long-term perspective, however, natural gas is very limited in supply. In the United States, the remaining natural gas resource is expected to be near depletion within 50 years. Coal is clearly the nation's greatest resource, representing approximately 90 percent of our fossil energy reserves. 

Calpine is certainly capitalizing on the near-term future of natural gas-fired generation. They announced a purchase of 35 7FB and 11 7FA gas-fired turbines from General Electric in April of this year and 27 Siemens Westinghouse steam turbines just last month. The purchase announcements are a part of Calpine's five-year strategic plan to have 70,000 megawatts of generation online by the end of 2005. 

The U.S. imports only (net) 3.6 Tcf of natural gas, largely from Canada. Natural-gas wellhead prices averaged over $6.00 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) during the first quarter of 2001, up sharply from $3.62/mcf seen in 2000 and nearly triple the 1999 average price of $2.08/mcf. The price increases are attributed to a decline in U.S. gas production during the 1990s because of low prices, the increase in demand driven by new power generation, and gas storage levels dropping below normal. Recently, gas prices returned to the $2/mcf level after a mild summer, but NYMEX futures contracts for late 2002 deliveries are trading above the $3/mcf level indicating the expectation that gas prices will rise in response to the anticipated increased demand. 

Canadian imports are also expected to expand substantially through 2020 resulting from additional gas-fired electric power plants. This anticipated increased consumption requires expansion of gas pipeline and storage capacity-$1.5 trillion over the next 15 years according to the National Petroleum Council. Duke Energy certainly has recognized this trend and has capitalized quickly by announcing the purchase of Westcoast Energy, Inc., a Canadian-based utility engaged primarily in natural-gas gathering, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution, as well as electric power generation, international, financial, information technology, and energy services businesses. 

From Gas to Renewables 

According to one of Shell's scenarios, at some point we will move from gas to renewables. Shell lists those options as solar and wind energy and has backed up its claim with a $500-million to $1-billion spending package over the next five years, focused primarily on-you guessed it-solar and wind. If a large oil company announced that it had up to $1 billion to invest in solar and wind, who would begin to show up on the radar screen? Let's take a quick look at a few likely candidates. 

AstroPower, Inc.
461 Wyoming Road, Solar Park
Newark, DE 19716-2000
www.astropower.com 
Technology: Photovoltaics
Start date: 1983


AstroPower produces a complete line of photovoltaic solar cells, solar modules and complete systems packages for residential, commercial and industrial applications as well as turnkey power plant solutions for utilities in the newly deregulated energy market. They originally received a $2.3-million investment from the Department of Energy (DOE) and have since IPO'd and can be found on the NASDAQ at symbol APWR. 

Big Frog Mountain
100 Cherokee Blvd., Suite 321
Chattanooga, TN 37405
www.bigfrogmountain.com 
Technology: Alternative energy sources
Start date: 1999


Big Frog Mountain is a private company that designs and supplies renewable energy equipment to businesses, industry and private residences. The alternative energy equipment supplies power using micro-hydro, solar panels and wind turbines. 

Bergey Windpower Co., Inc.
2001 Priestley Avenue
Norman, OK 73069
www.bergey.com 
Technology: Wind turbines
Start date: 1979 


Bergey Windpower is a private firm that designs and manufactures wind generators in sizes of 850, 1,500 and 10,000 watts. They claim to have seen an increase in home wind energy systems as a result of the California energy crisis. 

Worthy of noting here is the fact that Shell competitor BP has already entered into the renewable arena and has recently formed a new division known as BP Solar. Based in Linthicum, Md., they produce high-efficiency silicon cells and modules, custom-designed batteries, power control electronics and where appropriate, load equipment in the solar industry. Fueling Shell's interest may be some of the recent successes that BP Solar has enjoyed. 

In March of this year, BP Solar announced that over 400,000 residents of the Philippines would benefit from a deal signed between them and the Spanish and Philippine governments to bring solar power to 150 isolated villages in the Philippines. Led by the Philippine Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), the $48-million contract-the largest solar energy project ever-is financed by the Spanish government and will be implemented in two phases, the first scheduled to begin just last month. 

In April of this year, BP Solar announced plans to build a solar-module assembly plant in Hamlin, Lower Saxony, Germany. With a total investment in Hamlin of $12 million, the plant will have an annual production capacity of 20 MW and create more than 100 new jobs. 

The Hamlin plant was soon surpassed by the announcement of an Australian facility in June. Opening in Homebush Bay in Sydney, the new plant will manufacture BP's high-efficiency solar panels, bringing valuable export dollars to the country with over 60 percent of the panels to be exported around the world. BP invested over $20 million to build the plant that is providing over 200 high tech jobs. The new facility houses all of BP Solar's Australian manufacturing, design and market support facilities. Cell annual output capacity will reach 25MW in 2001 and the plant has the capability for possible further expansion. 

Do Renewables Include Fuel Cells? 

Shell also mentioned multiple scenarios under their long-range planning efforts, one of which included an increase in the fuel cell industry. According to the fuel cell scenario, rapid growth in fuel cells-which produce electricity from hydrogen and cut harmful emissions-could shift the energy business dramatically away from oil long before oil becomes scarce. Today's fuel cells typically create hydrogen by reforming natural gas, so they do not fit the definition of being a renewable resource. Rather, fuel cells hold great promise to reduce air pollution emissions when compared to combustion technologies. Fuel cells produce near-zero emissions and highly pure water when converting a hydrogen-rich source into electric energy. 

I am impressed that two of the three largest oil producers are beginning to look at their mainstay business as being limited in the long run. Radical changes that are possible in the energy business means that the industry participants which dominated the last century such as Exxon, BP and Shell cannot afford to assume they will dominate for the next 100 years. In the words of Shell Chairman Phil Watts, ""that would be a very complacent view. Longevity in corporations is not the norm."" Chairman Watts reminds me of an exercise performed in many business schools around the country today. Look at the New York Stock Exchange 100 years ago and try to find companies that are still in the ""mix."" Surprisingly, it is difficult to find many. Those that are still in existence have had to change dramatically in order to survive. IBM used to be a typewriter manufacturer. Today they are the world's largest computer company. Where will the oil companies be in 50 years? Will they still be strictly oil and gas? If Watts executes his scenario plans, not a chance.

"Credit Derivatives Issue","You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in the
credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in the UK.
ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement
regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others are
either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not issue
a statement. 
 
Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible
bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. What
is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of ""Not
Contingent"" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typically
required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that the
payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at the
option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of
the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercise
the conversion (sometimes referred to as a ""widows and orphans"" clause) is a
standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion
right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so. In
the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trustee
to convert exists.
 
A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, the
User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in the
next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the
""group of six"" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, we
suggest that ""plain vanilla"" convertible bonds should satisfy the ""Not
Contingent"" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. ""Plain
vanilla"" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion
is at the option of the holder of the trustee.
 
A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) is
scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything prior
to that meeting.
 
I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement
regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their views
on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are also
discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how we
might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share your
views with the other addressees of this email, as they are coordinating the
views of members.

Jurisdictional Disputes Intensify
As FERC Seeks to Extend Its Authority 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Dow Jones] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe rules requiring utilities to turn control of their power-grid assets to independent management. The controversial effort to carve up the nation's electricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizations (RTOs) is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. The workshops, dubbed ""RTO Week,"" were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls ""buy in"" for the effort, which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilities, state regulators and members of Congress. 

Analysis: The objective of this week's workshops may be to gain support from the industry for FERC's controversial mandate, but they are also having the effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERC's jurisdictional boundaries. The issue has become rather evenly divided. On one side, critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order, which as noted has become somewhat of a ""cause c?l?bre"" for new Chairman Wood. On the other hand, supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commission and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power suppliers into the nation's transmission system. By Wood's own directive, the discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into what were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boiling point, as a Dec. 15 deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant utilities is fast approaching. 

Certainly, the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman (after replacing Curt H?bert last month) has signaled a new era for the federal commission, which oversees much of the energy industry's wholesale market and the nation's power grid. As noted, Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key objectives. Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more interventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec. 15, by which time transmission-owning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities. Using what he has referred to as a ""big stick,"" Wood warned that failing to comply with the Dec. 15 deadline would cost transmission-owning utilities their right to charge market-based rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in which the utilities might become engaged. 

This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand, but has also sparked an intense debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregulating energy market. Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints on FERC's authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional leaders, who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they traditionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers. State regulators, particularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparatively low, argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is. Such states want to retain their present regulatory oversight (rather than completely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC), and also believe that now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the nation's transmission system is managed. Also in question is the extent to which regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcend state boundaries. 

Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERC's authority to force it to participate in an RTO. In its July order, FERC directed Southern Company (along with the Southwest Power Pool, Entergy Corp. and Grid South) to form a single RTO for the Southeast region, most likely adopting a structure modeled after Grid South. However, Southern Company already has sunk about $3 billion into its own 26,000-mile system, over which it wants to retain independent control. 

FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significant cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced electricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced. However, Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO could run as high as $100 million, which could be passed on to customers in the form of higher rates. Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosophical point of view and questions whether or not the commission's vision of four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient. One of Southern's concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too large and end up operating like monopolies. Ironically, the issue has caused dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant, which as an independent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid. While Southern disagrees with FERC's authority to force RTO participation, Mirant supports the federal government's efforts to streamline transmission activity. 

Leaders of RTO West-the transmission entity in which FERC wants to include the transmission assets of states in the Northwest, Southwest and California-also question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC's authority to mandate this structure. Leaders in the region have said that the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates, considering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity to meet high demand in the area. In other words, although FERC may be endorsing market-based rates for those transmission-owning utilities that join RTOs, some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for increased activity. 

Nevertheless, along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as Dynegy and Enron, which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems. Hence, these companies agree with FERC's emphasis on RTO formations, as generation companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved from utilities to independent management companies. 

In addition to the RTO issue, the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictional authority to a head. The utility's parent PG&E Corp. is pursuing a ""ring fencing"" strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Put simply, PG&E Corp. is trying to protect other valuable assets by transferring them into a new, federally regulated subsidiary. The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues because the California Public Utility Commission, which presently regulates the utility operations of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., believes that it has the right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary. Further, the state government in California believes that PG&E Corp.'s plan would give too much regulatory control to FERC, and by the same token reduce the amount of control that California would have over generation assets that are presently contained in a regulated subsidiary. 

The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the federal legal system. In fact, last week the Supreme Court began hearing arguments from federal lawyers, state regulators and private industry, addressing not only FERC's authority to mandate RTOs but also the commission's 1996 order that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission systems. Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Federal Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participation in an RTO. At present, the commission had danced around the issue by calling for ""voluntary"" participation, yet still affixing stiff penalties for utilities that refuse to comply. 

In addition, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring bill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session (which could prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by early November). Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs, and his draft bill reportedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and private utilities that own power lines. At the same time, however, it is believed that Barton's draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedited federal court hearing if they disagree with FERC's order, which again would further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on transmission issues. 

Moreover, Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this debate over FERC's authority as disputes between state and federal regulatory oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge. However, given FERC's deadline of Dec. 15 for RTO participation, the issue has gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in their heels and rebuff the federal commission's mandate.

"FW: Legal Support for Asset Dispositions","FYI; let me know if you have any thoughts about my approach below.  I met with Jeff Golden earlier today and he suggested that such a ""matrix"" was being prepared and should be ready for distribution early next week.  It amazes me that we don't have all of this in a nice, neat little package.  I will push hard to make sure this gets put together.

Good luck on the forms of documents.  I tried to implement this for two years, but I couldn't get anyone in the legal department to take it on, nor could I get buy-in from the satellite corporate development groups.  I sincerely hope you are successful, although it may fall into the category of too little, too late....

Take care,

Some of what follows may be old news or otherwise outdated, but as I try to get up the learning curve w/r/t our efforts regarding asset dispositions, I thought it may be helpful to summarize some items that I would think could be extremely helpful in the organization of our commercial and legal actions.  I recognize that there is no ""one template fits all""; nevertheless,  it would be extremely helpful if we already have or are otherwise organizing the following:

(1) Forms of CAs, LOUs/MOUs, PSA Agreements, and other relevant M&A docs;
(2) Matrix-type organization for every asset/business/investment that is ""for sale"" providing for the following:
   (a) Asset description and location;
   (b) Ownership of asset, including ownership schematics;
   (c) Book value of asset; estimated market value--and support for such; relevant financial information;
   (d) Likely purchasers;
   (e) Restrictions on transferability, including tax issues, consents, regulatory approvals, financings, etc.
   (f) Lead commercial contact;
   (g) In-house legal support, accounting support, tax support;
   (h) Outside counsel (U.S. and local, where appropriate);
   (i)  Outside advisors (investment bank, etc) and their counsel;
   (j) Status report and likely (realistic) timeframe; and
   (k) Other

If any of you can advise me whether we already have these items in place or, if not, your suggestions in this regard, I would very much appreciate it.

Clement,

I hope you are well.

In the current circumstances, Enron Europe senior management feel some discomfort in signing Corp guarantees under the power of attorney mechanism we have in place. As a result, we intend to revert to forwarding these documents to Houston, presumably yourself, for execution. 

I apologise for adding to your burden this way. Having done so, I would be grateful if you could do your usual sterling job in ensuring that these documents, which support our trading business are dealt with as promptly as your other responsibilities allow. 

Many thanks

Formation of Northeast RTO 
Challenged by Structural, Governance Issues 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] An administrative law judge at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) released a blueprint to establish a single electricity transmission system for 11 Northeastern states, possibly as early as the end of 2002, based on the existing PJM Interconnection model. Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) are a priority for FERC, which is looking for ways to make the nation's patchwork transmission grid seamless in moving power between regions. An RTO is a combination of individual transmission operations that combine their assets under a common roof. FERC Judge Peter Young wrote in a 27-page report that there were ""difficult substantive issues"" in the path of creating an RTO for the Northeast. Young has held secret talks with the parties since then to prepare a report and business plan to FERC commissioners, who are expected to issue a decision by Nov. 1. 

Analysis: The complications now surfacing with regard to the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast are rather symptomatic of larger problems that may continually arise as the consolidation among transmission entities across the United States continues. The Northeast region includes three distinct transmission entities-the New England Independent System Operator (ISO), the New York ISO and the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection-all of which were operating as separate organizations until two months ago when they were essentially ordered to conjoin by FERC. The Northeast region consists of 11 states and the District of Columbia, and combining the various markets in the region would reportedly create the largest electric power market in the world. Thus, if we look at the Northeast situation as a national template, conjoining the various RTOs across the country into four large regional entities, per FERC's directive, may be an arduous task. In addition, consolidation could add multiple layers of bureaucracy to what is already an extremely complex sector of the energy industry. 

For background, it is important to realize that the current challenges associated with forming a single transmission entity stem from a FERC order released last July ordering all of the existing RTOs in the country to explore consolidation. The contentious order, which has sparked intense controversy among certain utilities and existing RTOs, literally lays out the blueprint for how FERC wants the nation's transmission systems to be constructed. FERC has clearly directed four regional systems (in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and West) although no reference was made to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which exists outside of FERC's jurisdiction and essentially operates as its own transmission island. The commission had previously set a deadline of Dec. 15, 2001, for RTOs to become functional, so most of the transmission entities impacted by the order were in the midst of formulating their operational plans when the order was issued on July 11. 

In the Northeast region, FERC directed that a new Northeast RTO would be created for this region and would essentially follow the template that has been established by the PJM Interconnection, which as noted operates the wholesale transmission market in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. In fact, FERC has often commented that PJM represents the most successful RTO that has been formed in the United States to date. FERC has said that PJM should serve as the platform (or starting point) for mediation talks in the Northeast. Under FERC's new order, the existing New England and New York ISOs would be required to join PJM. From the time that FERC's order was first released, I suspected that these two entities would resist FERC's mandate to join PJM, as they have previously stated that a substantial amount of time and money has already been spent on forming their ISO entities, and consolidation could nullify those efforts. 

It appears that my projections are now coming true. While sincere efforts are being made to consolidate the three transmission entities in the Northeast, the parties involved are realizing that conjoining three large and separate transmission organizations is a very complicated process. The main obstacles seem to surround structural and governing issues, which I expect will also be stumbling blocks for RTOs in the other three regions of the country as they proceed with their own consolidation efforts. 

Moving forward, I will attempt to shed some light on the ""difficult substantive issues"" surrounding the Northeast RTO (in the words of the FERC administrative law judge). As negotiations continue in this area, various stakeholders have been involved in the discourse, including energy companies, financial investors and companies that seek to be involved in the management of the transmission assets in the area (namely, National Grid). As noted, governance of the Northeast RTO board is the ""thorniest"" issue of all, again in the words of Judge Peter Young. There has been little doubt that FERC has routinely praised the model used by the PJM system and in fact clearly stated in its order that the New England and New York ISOs should adopt the PJM model. Now, however, new FERC Chairman Pat Wood has acknowledged that the commission may have been in error to express such strong support for only one model out of three. Nevertheless, FERC already has rejected the requests of the New England and New York ISOs to maintain their status as free-standing entities. 

For instance, on the issue of how the RTO will be governed, the New England ISO reportedly believes that all three regions should be equally represented to ensure that the unique needs of each are given fair consideration. In other words, the New England ISO has expressed concerns, which are reportedly shared by the New York ISO as well, that all three of the Northeast's major grid operators may not get equal billing in a future board of directors tapped to run the new network. One concession made along these lines is that FERC has allowed the New England ISO to continue developing the Standard Market Design, or SMD, for New England. The SMD, based on the PJM Interconnection's market design and rules, will provide critical market improvements in advance of the single Northeast market. 

The leader of the New York ISO echoed these concerns and reportedly stated that any missteps in the formation of the single Northeast RTO ""could make California's energy woes look almost insignificant by comparison."" Further, William Museler, the New York ISO's CEO, pointed out that the New York ISO represents the largest electricity market of the three by far (posting a market value for 2000 of $5.2 billion compared to $1.7 billion for PJM and $0.6 billion for ISO New England). However, Museler acknowledges that the New England ISO and PJM have unique areas in which they lead the Northeast region. For example, PJM leads the region in total load served and ISO New England leads the region in the number of states represented. 

The other issue that is complicating the formation of a single Northeast RTO is of a structural nature. Specifically, complex software is needed to set up a single entity in the region (and in other regions that are presently attempting to conjoin various entities). In fact, the selection and installation of this software may actually delay the formation of the Northeast RTO until the fourth quarter of 2004, according to Judge Young. In addition, Young reportedly said the software and technology needed to set up an RTO to keep electricity smoothly moving throughout the Northeast will rank second only to that used by the banking industry. 

While much of the debate surrounding the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast may seem like policy minutia, it does have a very critical impact on real-world operations in the region. The problem may be particularly acute in New England, a region where deficiencies in the transmission system have already begun to cause reliability problems. As I've discussed in previous columns (see the 8/23/01 IssueAlert, available at ""> www.scientech.com/rci, for more information) New England has maintained an adequate supply of power generation but is suffering from a strained transmission system. The six-state region of New England covers about 8,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines. As a whole, the region is capable of generating about 26,000 MW of electricity, and during the heat wave of the last few weeks consumption peaked at 25,102 MW, creating an extremely tight situation for utilities such as NStar. 

Leaders at the New England ISO, for instance, have acknowledged that transmission constraints in the region have caused inefficient operation. Without necessary upgrades to the system, they say, electricity transmission to areas of short supply could add $125 million to $600 million per year to the price of delivering power through the region from 2002 through 2006. Power outages that occurred in the Boston area this summer highlighted fundamental deficiencies in the region's transmission and distribution systems, the improvements for which are dependent on large sums of capital investment and a conducive political environment. The bottom line may be that, without a comprehensive and functioning RTO in the region, investments to upgrade the transmission system in the area may be delayed, exposing the region to further reliability problems. 

Moreover, the challenges associated with forming one RTO in the Northeast may support the argument against consolidating RTOs, which comes mostly from the existing transmission entities and utility owners who argue that millions of dollars in start-up costs and infrastructure investment will be lost if their independent systems are nullified. In addition, these entities have a real problem with losing their current autonomy and independent control over their own transmission systems. Thus, the FERC order regarding consolidation will continue to be challenged and its implementation may be a long and involved process.

Montana Power: 
Problems Continue to Overshadow Transformation Into Touch America



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from CBS MarketWatch] Montana Power shares fell on Nov. 16, a day after the utility posted a loss for its third quarter, citing the slowdown in the economy and the company's transition from a diversified energy company to a stand-alone telecommunications firm. The stock fell to a 52-week low of $4.05 earlier in the session. It closed Nov. 16 at $4.18, down 52 cents. As of early morning trading on Nov. 19, Montana Power shares remained at $4.18. 

Analysis: There is little doubt that Montana Power currently finds itself at a challenging crossroads. The company remains in the midst of becoming solely a telecommunications operation, having sold off much of its utility holdings. However, the process has hit several snags, including an incomplete transfer of its transmission and distribution unit to Northwestern Corp. Compounding Montana Power's current problems is a weakened financial performance, which continues to worsen and also leaves little capital to build the telecom business. In addition, the company faces a host of related challenges, including uncertainty about the final regulatory approval needed for the asset sale to Northwestern, requests for rate increases to fund the purchase of power that Montana Power must buy on the wholesale market, and inspection of the long-term power-purchase contracts that the company has formed with various suppliers. The question that investors should be asking with regard to Montana Power's current plight is whether or not the financial losses and resulting drop in stock price represent a temporary setback or some larger indication of doubt about the company's viability as a telecom operation. 

For its third quarter 2001, Montana Power posted a loss of $27.5 million, or 26 cents a share, representing a $57.3-million swing from its 3Q 2000 profit of $30.4 million, or 29 cents a share. During the third quarter of 2000, Montana Power had reported a net income of $31.3 million. Montana Power has noted that the losses in the current quarter were not solely related to Touch America, but also included a $14.8-million pre-tax write-down of investments in two other telecommunications companies. One had filed for bankruptcy and the other defaulted on loans that Montana Power had helped guarantee. In addition, company officials have attributed the loss to price decreases and the slowing economy. However, note that the current third-quarter losses followed losses in the second quarter as well. Specifically, the company reported a net loss of $10.9 million, or 11 cents a share, in the 2Q 2001, compared with net income of $35.5 million, or 34 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2000. The company also previously reduced its expectations of revenue growth in 2001 to 10 percent from 25 percent. According to Montana Power's CEO Bob Gannon, the company is merely experiencing a ""short-term liquidity problem."" 

Nevertheless, to say that Montana Power is having some growing pains is an understatement. Since March 2000, it has been Montana Power's goal to totally divest all of its energy assets and re-emerge as a debt-free communications company, operating under the name of Touch America (presently the company's telecom subsidiary), with zero debt, $350 million in cash and 26,000 miles of fiber communications lines. CEO Gannon originally envisioned, and continues to see, Touch America as one of the largest broadband companies in the country and a more lucrative business model than the formerly integrated Montana Power. Much of the transition has already taken place, considering that Montana Power has successfully divested its oil and gas, coal and independent power production businesses. As noted, the last piece of the puzzle is the sale of its electric and natural-gas utility operations to Northwestern Corp., a provider of electricity, natural-gas and communications services to Midwestern customers. This is a big piece of the puzzle, however, as Touch America is counting on proceeds from the distribution sale to support continued growth. 

Therein lies one of the main challenges for Montana Power. The Montana Public Service Commission is the last regulatory agency that needs to approve the sale of these assets. Some analysts have suggested that Montana Power's financial problems can be resolved only if the Montana Public Service Commission approves the sale of the electric and natural-gas distribution systems, which could inject some $460 million in Touch America's operations. Yet, state regulators are ensuring that the state consumer counsel's office, which represents ratepayers in utility cases, and a group of large industrial electricity users also have an opportunity to raise any concerns about the proposed sale of the assets. The less time provided for equal-opportunity review and comment could increase the likelihood that the sale could be challenged down the line. 

After some early deliberation, the Montana Public Service Commission has now agreed to review the $1.1-billion proposed sale of the assets to Northwestern Corp. by Jan. 31, 2002, although lawyers for Montana Power are still lobbying to have this review moved up to December. Part of the pressure for the review, the company's attorneys have argued, is that if the sale is not approved by the end of the year, investors and lenders may lose patience regarding the uncertainty of the deal and refuse to provide any further capital support into the growing Touch America. Furthermore, the viability of the entire business plan for Touch America could be brought into question if this asset sale is not approved by state regulators, considering that Montana Power is counting on proceeds from the sale to support growth of the new telecom company. The sales agreement between Montana Power and Northwestern Corp. expires March 31, 2002, so time is also a factor. 

Another issue that has yet to be resolved is Montana Power's intent to raise rates to support purchases of wholesale power. In other words, as a tangential issue related to the sale of its assets, state regulators also question how Montana Power will recover certain power-supply costs as it continues to morph into a telecom business. The company has established that it expects to pay nearly $2 billion over the next 30 years for wholesale power purchases that have been necessitated by its transition to a telecom company from a utility holding company, and hopes to increase electric rates by 20 percent to support these expenses. Montana Power is still considered the default provider to about 288,000 customers, and needs an average of 670 MW for its customers. However, the company also needs to keep a total of 1,050 MW as a peak load during the winter months and aims to keep 100 MW of reserve power. 

Since the company voluntarily divested its own generation facilities to PPL Corp., it must procure its entire load on the open market at rates set by the Montana Public Service Commission. The 20-percent rate increase reportedly would increase residential electricity rates by about $2.00 a month starting in July 2002, making the average bill about $64 per month. In addition to the projected 20-percent increase for residential customers, Montana Power estimated that small businesses could see their rates increase by 21 percent and medium industrial customers could see a 36-percent increase. It is important to note that a recent survey by the Great Falls Tribune concluded that, the increase in Montana Power's rates would produce some of the highest residential electric rates in the Northwest. 

Montana Power is attempting to establish long-term power contracts with suppliers to meet its entire load requirements. For instance, Montana Power formed a buy-back agreement with PPL as a condition of the generation sale two years ago. This contract expires July 1, 2002. Beyond that date, Montana Power announced that it signed a one-year contract to buy 111 MW from Duke Energy at an undisclosed price. PPL also has formed a new contract to provide 450 MW to Montana Power over a five-year period after its current contract expires. Northwestern Power, the purchaser of Montana Power's distribution system, has said that it wants Montana Power to assemble a diverse package of power-purchase deals (instead of buying all its load from one source) to encourage the development of new generation sources in the region. Montana Power has reportedly submitted a portfolio of power-purchase deals to the Montana Public Service Commission to determine the inclusion of those deals within the rate structure, and the portfolio contains about three-fourths of the 1,129 MW that Montana Power will need to cover its peak demand of customers and maintain an adequate reserve. The company will probably purchase the balance of its requirements on the short-term market. 

Also, on the legal front, Montana Power continues to navigate through at least two litigious proceedings. First, in August, a group of Montana Power shareholders initiated a lawsuit against the utility, claiming the company's effort to get out of the electricity business was illegal and cost them $3 billion in lost stock value. The complaint, filed in the District Court at Butte, said the sale of Montana Power generation plants to PPL Montana in December 1999 was done without the required shareholder approval and should be overturned. The suit also asks for a court order putting the plants and an estimated $100 million in profits realized by PPL from operating the plants into a trust until the case is resolved. What this means is that the sale of Montana Power's generation assets are in a state of litigation, even though the sale of the generation assets was completed two years ago. Another lawsuit is related to Montana Power's $200-million purchase last year of Qwest Communications' long-distance and other telephone businesses within a 14-state service area. Essentially, Montana Power has launched a suit against Qwest, alleging that Qwest has violated anti-trust laws and constrained competition in the long-distance and voice and data market. 

Consequently, as Montana Power closes out the year and hits the two-year mark in its transformation into Touch America, the future for the company looks rather questionable. Although there are market doubts about the future of the telecom sector, Montana Power remains confident that its long-term prospects as a telecom company remain very strong. Nevertheless, the current question for investors is how quickly and how successfully Montana can complete its transformation into Touch America. In other words, what Montana Power sees on the horizon may not be so easily reached. The path to the company's final destination is obviously marked by several financial and legal obstacles.

Bruce:
 
After a couple of go arounds, below is the Indian counsel's (Mr. Talwar) opinion with respect to Enron Fuels International's (EFI) claim as to the Fixed Fee as provided in the Fuel Management Agreement (FMA).  I am sure Doug Leach has mentioned to you the mark-to-market and accrual income exposure of $14 million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution.  EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB.
 
Mr. Talwar's view is that as long as the PPA is valid, EFI has the right to collect the fee.  If, however, the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEB's claim, then EFI would not be entitled to the fee.
 
I just want to point out that as DPC (and Enron) is working for a resolution, EFI's role should also be considered.  And along those lines, EFI should take an active role in pursuing that its interest is protected.
 
Please call me at 35336 to discuss.

Dear Andy,

The answers to each of your questions is as follows :

1.      There is no theory under Indian law that Enron could use, to make an enforceable claim against MSEB in the context of the facts placed before us.

2.      The concept of agency relationships does exist under Indian Contract Law.  The concept of third party beneficiary claims does not exist under Indian Contract Law.  However, Enron cannot make use of the agency relationship theory as the Agreement has not, apart from stating that DPC will be Enron's agent, stated that DPC will be acting under the Agreement as agent for Enron for all purposes.

3.      Yes, our view is that Enron has no enforceable claim against MSEB on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the Agreement.  However, if DPC makes a claim against MSEB and a judgment is awarded to DPC for recovery of the Fixed Fee, either as such or by way of damage, then Enron would have a right to attach the amount that may be payable by MSEB to DPC.

Kind regards,

Suresh

I am a little bit confused.  Is there any theory under Indian law we could

use to make a claim against MSEB?  In America, we might have a claim under

an agency relationship or a third party beneficiary claim.  Is there any

such creature under Indian law?  Is your advice that we have no claim

whatsoever?

   Hello Andy,

   I refer to your email of 20th September, 2001 seeking clarification in

   respect of the advice we gave you on the 19th of September, 2001 on the

   Fuel Management Agreement (Agreement).

   You wish to know whether Enron Fuels International Inc (Enron/Fuel

   Manager) could make a claim under Indian law against MSEB on any

   potential theories such as agency relationship, third party beneficiary

   claims etc.

   MSEB has to discharge certain functions under the Agreement.  These

   include amongst others, approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed

   by the Fuel Manager, providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices

   issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA, etc.

   There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered

   into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and

   no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf.

   Enron's right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement, is

   contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee

   by MSEB.  I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB.

   The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by

   the provisions of the PPA, to which Enron is not a party.  Therefore

   there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEB/DPC as regards

   the PPA.  As a result, Enron has no claim against MSEB for non-payment

   of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against

   MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions

   under the Agreement.

   I trust I have answered your query adequately.  Please feel free to call

   for any questions that you may have.

   Kind regards,

   Suresh

--""CAN YOU FIND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DIRECTIVE 6025.13?""

  All subscribers to TheLaw.net enjoy unlimited, free Reference Support - even to the point where we will quickly find the item for you if it's out there, even ones that are not accessible via the web's best search engines.

  Here's an interactive example of what we mean.

  We are particularly skilled at quickly scraping hard-to-find documents from among the two billion plus public web pages in just a few short keystrokes. Recently, for example, a subscriber submitted, over our website, a request for Reference Support, wondering if we could locate Department of Defense Directive 6025.13. Even our massive pre-configured drop-down menu system didn't include this little known document and our frustrated client explained that he's been searching for this item online for more than two years.

  Here's the process we deployed:

1. We went to Northernlight - one of the great search engines - http://www.northernlight.com

2. We entered - 6025.13 - as the search term, which returned less than two dozen hits from the more than one billion pages indexed by Northernlight:
See, http://www.northernlight.com/nlquery.fcg?cb=0&qr=6025.13

3.  We scrolled down the first page of results and Hit No. 5 caught our eye since the title of the page said: ""Department of Defense"" and the brief summary text made reference to 6025.15 (not 6025.13, but certainly close enough to warrant a mouse click)

4.  Clicking Hit No. 5, we were transported to this page:
http://web7.whs.osd.mil/text/i602515p.txt

5. We noted, based on the url structure, that we were definitely trolling deep through the subdirectories of a little known, but publicly available, U.S. Military web server. (Note the "".mil"" extension in the root directory which identifies U.S. Military web servers).

6.  We used the Find Function in our browser and jumped to every instance of 6025.13 in the document and noted that while the document had been excerpted on this page - it wasn't the official document we were looking for.

7. We peeled back the url from:
http://web7.whs.osd.mil/text/i602515p.txt to:
http://web7.whs.osd.mil/text
pressed enter and received a message that said: ""You are not authorized to view this page""

8. So we again peeled back the url from:
http://web7.whs.osd.mil/text to:
http://web7.whs.osd.mil
and received a message that said the site had been moved to:
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives
We happily noted the word ""directives"" in the new url and clicked the link.

9. Paydirt. We landed on the Defense Department's Washington Headquarters Services, Directives and Records Division.

10. From the homepage we clicked the link captioned:
Directives 5000.1 - 8999.99 which took us to this page:
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/dir2.html

11. Again, using the browser's Find Function, we jumped directly to the link for Directive 6025.13, click and landed here:
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/602513.htm

12. We selected the PDF version, which took us here:
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/d602513_072095/d602513p.pdf


--THE UPSHOT

  After printing the document, we noted the domain from our final destination: http://www.dtic.mil and returning to Northernlight, we entered it as a search term and noticed that the web server we ultimately found had never been indexed by Northernlight. This U.S. military site may well be blocked from indexing robots or it may simply be so new, that Northernlight's spider has not yet crawled the site. No wonder our guy had such a tough time!


--SUMMARY

  This search was particularly successful because within about 90 seconds we found the official version of what we were looking for.

  However, had we NOT been able to find the document using our checklist of efficient search techniques, it would have still been a win for our client. Why? Because we would have been able to all but rule out the possibility that the desired item was available on the public web, saving him hours of hunting and pecking. We can do the same for you.

  And what about cost? What did all of this cost our client? Absolutely nothing. We provide our clients with access to our Southern California Development Center via our software, our web site, email and a dedicated toll free line. The day you subscribe, we become your virtual partner with an eye toward building a business relationship that has teeth. Self-serving? You bet. We're in the subscription business, we want you back a year from now and we want you to tell your colleagues that TheLaw.net represents the BEST legal research value on the market today!


--ASK YOURSELF

----Have you been hesitant to test alternative research tools?

----Are you weary of paying through the nose for case law research?

----Do you have chains around you because you can't afford or justify a subscription plan with the big boys that let's you jump from jurisdiction to jurisdiction without getting hammered?

----Do the bells and whistles constantly being added by software developers render you glassy-eyed?

----Are your reps currently laying the groundwork for more price increases?

  Join us at TheLaw.net Corporation with the security of a 30-day unconditional money-back guarantee and we'll do our level best to ensure your success - whatever it takes.

Compliments of the day to you.
  
I wish to extend this mutual business proposal to you with the hope that you will accept. I am the principal auditor of Department of Petroleum Resources.  In the course of discharging my duty last year, I discovered an over invoiced contract payment due for payment to a foreign contractor.
  
I am writing you to seek your assistance and collaboration to enable me use my position in Government to secure the approval for the payment of this over invoiced contract claim to your bank account.   This particular contract was awarded to a Foreign Contractor and was over estimated to the tune of US$36,561,000.00 (Thirty Six Million, Five Hundred and Sixty one Thousand US Dollars Only). The foreign Contractor has received full payment for the actual contract value, leaving behind the sum of US$36,561,000.00 which represents the over estimated contract valuE
Currently lying at the Central Bank of Nigeria. The over estimated value of $36,561,000.00 was meant to be a Kick Back to the Government officials that awarded the contract. These Government officials have been removed from office and they had no chance of collecting the money before leaving office. As a result of updated payment advise at the Central
Bank, it has been awaiting transfer to a Foreign Account.
  
Having done all the necessary groundwork, this money is now in our possession and I am looking for a trustworthy person into whose private or company's account this money would be transferred.
  
Upon the transfer of this money, 70% of the sum will be for me, 25% shall be for you the account owner, while the remaining 5% shall be set aside to refund expenses made in the course of this transaction. Be assured that this business is safe  but the keyword is the confidentiality, due to the nature of the transaction and my position in the ministry.
  
Kindly treat as urgent.  
  
Yours faithfully,

FASB to Issue for Comment Securitizations Guidance on Derivatives 
BNA - September 20, 2001
 
NORWALK, Conn.--The Financial Accounting Standards Board Sept. 19 approved plans to publish guidance on an issue in which rules on derivatives accounting meet those for securitizations. 
However, the accounting pronouncement is effectively held in abeyance so that the public can make comments on it as part of FASB's due process. 
 
The guidance pertains to beneficial interests that arise in securitization transactions subject to FASB Statement No. 140, rules on transfers of financial assets that superseded FASB Statement No. 125. More specifically, the key provisions at issue would more clearly state which beneficial interests meet the definition of a derivative under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its amended version, FASB Statement No. 138. 
 
That guidance, which FASB tentatively decided to propose as part of a forthcoming ""technical corrections"" project on derivatives issues, would replace Derivatives Implementation Issue No. D1, on the application of Statement 133 to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. 
Neel Foster and others on FASB spoke of the planned guidance as an improvement over Issue No. D1, which was devised with the assistance of FASB's Derivatives Implementation Group. 
 
FASB's staff proposed the reading of derivatives accounting rules as they pertain to beneficial interests as staff guidance. Although he supported the substance of the guidance, Foster said, ""It clearly is an amendment of 133 and 138"" that warrants FASB's full due process.  Others on the board, such as John Wulff and Katherine Schipper, agreed. FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins spoke of the importance of issuing timely guidance, and therefore supported a compromise devised in exchanges with Foster to issue guidance on beneficial interests that meet the definition of a derivative in the technical corrections effort that would be limited to issues stemming from the use of FASB Statements No. 133 and 138. 
 
In that way, what Foster argued was a substantive change worthy of due process reserved for a proposed amendment to a standard would be floated for wide public comment. The timetable for technical corrections project is yet to be determined.  In the meantime, the proposed accounting prescription is to be posted soon at FASB's site on the World Wide Web. 
 
Language on Beneficial Interests as Derivatives
 
Under the proposed guidance that was less controversial, FASB's staff described which beneficial interests are eligible for the scope exception under paragraph 14 of Statement No. 133--in other words, which beneficial interests arising in securitizations would not be accounted for as derivatives.  On which beneficial interests meet the definition of a derivatives under paragraph 6 of FASB No. 133, the staff proposed: 
 
?       ""If there is any initial net investment in a forward-based contract, the contract would not meet the criterion in paragraph 6(b). However, if a forward based contract has a de minimis initial net investment that represents compensation for terms that are more or less favorable than market conditions, an entity may choose to account for such a contract as either (1) a hybrid instrument that must be bifurcated into a debt host and a derivatives whose initial fair value is zero or, (2) a derivative in its entirety. 
 
?       ""An options-based contract that involves an initial net investment that is equal to the fair value of the option would meet the criterion in paragraph 6(b).""
 
Victoria Lusniak, a FASB staff accountant, suggested that, if the guidance is finalized or the change otherwise is made, existing DIG guidance would be affected. Issue No. A9, on prepaid interest rate swaps, would be superseded; Issue No. E15, on the ""shortcut method"" after a purchase business combination, would be modified; and Issue No. B12, would have to undergo minor changes, Lusniak said.
 
DIG Issues Cleared
 
In other business at FASB's Sept. 19 meeting, the board did not object to seven DIG issues, or items of guidance developed with the help of the group, which is moribund. Those include issues on the definition of a derivative, scope exceptions, hedges of fair value, cash flow, and foreign currency.  The items are to be posted on FASB's Web site as final, cleared guidance on Oct. 10, said Robert Wilkins, a FASB project manager heading up the derivatives accounting effort. 
 
A DIG-related topic that generated the most debate was a proposal by Wulff to reconsider Issue No. C10, the result of earlier rulemaking on options and forward contracts with optionality features, to weigh exempting those derivatives from FASB No. 133 because they are deemed part of normal purchases or normal sales. Such derivatives are used by energy companies. 
However, by a vote of 6 to 1, with Wulff dissenting, the board rejected that course. 
 
Separately at the Sept. 19 meeting, FASB extended the comment deadline to Oct. 5 for two pending items that have been floated before the board's constituents and other interested parties. One item is a tandem proposal to possibly add two topics--on performance reporting and disclosures about intangible assets--to its rulemaking agenda. 
 
The other is a survey of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council on what standard-setting projects should be undertaken by FASB.  The deadlines were extended because of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, which FASB, in its first meeting since the tragedy, marked with a moment of silence for the victims.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission moved Sept. 19 to salve some of the functional sting from the Sept. 11 attacks on New York's financial district, by announcing a package of regulatory relief aimed at giving registrants extra time to meet normally mundane commission requirements. 
 
The CFTC said that for all registrants--including futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operators, and commodity trading advisors--it will not consider Sept. 11-Sept. 14 as ""business days"" for the purposes of calculating and meeting specific reporting and capital requirements, as well as bulk transfer obligations and records inspection requirements. The delay effectively extends those reporting deadlines. 
 
Furthermore, firms that were physically disrupted as a consequence of the attacks and thus unable to make certain calculations concerning segregated funds and secured amounts, have been excused from that obligation for those four days. 
 
Such damaged firms also will not have the four days counted against them, as either business or calendar days, for purposes of confirmation statements, transaction applications, and position closeout requirements, the CFTC said. Additionally, such firms will be excused for 31 days from requirements that their records be readily accessible. 
 
Collateral Consequences
 
Though trading in most futures and options contracts resumed two days after the Sept. 11 attack, the CFTC said relief was necessary because of the collateral damage caused by the explosions and their aftermath. While most trading takes place in Chicago and electronically from all points, many registrants were located at ground zero in lower Manhattan. ""This ... recognizes that firms may have had difficulty last week in moving funds, issuing notices, providing customers with access to records, or precisely measuring portfolio values,"" the CFTC said in a statement Sept. 19. 
 
The commission also extended relief to firms that have taken residence in temporary or incomplete facilities. Those operations will be allowed through Oct. 11 to extend deadlines for calculations on segregated funds that normally would be due at noon on a given day, to the close of the business day.  Similarly, firms that are unable to access time-stamping equipment will be allowed to use ""reasonable alternative methods"" to document times through Sept. 21. 
 
The CFTC also is asking firms that normally would file papers with the commission's New York regional office--which had been located in the now leveled World Trade Center--to send the items to the Chicago regional office at 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1600 North, Chicago, Ill., 60606.  
 
The National Futures Association, the leading organization representing the futures and options industry, said it worked with the commission to come up with the relief package. Larry Dyekman, a spokesman for NFA, said if the measures turn out not to be adequate, the group would consider pushing for more remedies. 
 
Acting CFTC Chairman James Newsome, in a Sept. 19 statement, praised the registrants' preparedness for the almost unthinkable. ""The foresight of their contingency plans, the steady hand of their leadership, and, most of all, the courage and tenacity of all of their people should instill in each of us great confidence in our nation's financial system,"" he said.
 
 
ISDA moves to stabilise derivatives markets
Risk - September 18, 2001
By John Ferry
 
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has issued guidelines to help traders close outstanding equity derivatives positions following the major disruptions to financial markets caused by last week's terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.  The trade body also said the posting of one-year dollar swaps rates has resumed. ""ISDA believes it is important to continue supporting orderly markets,"" said Jonathan Moulds, chair of ISDA's trading practice committee and head of global rates at Bank of America. 
 
ISDA advised that ""unless parties otherwise agree"", Tuesday to Friday of last week should not be considered days on which valuation or expiry of equity options should have occurred. The statement is relevant only ""where trading on a relevant exchange in the United States ceased or did not open as a result of the events occurring in New York City"". 
 
The latest statements follow advice given on Friday for the closing of energy-based derivatives contracts. ISDA advised that closing prices for the first day of trading following the market disruption should be used.
 
 
Clearinghouses Diversify or Die  
Appliederivatives.com - September 2001
 
Diversification. That's the name of the game in the futures clearing community today. Derivatives clearinghouses, sparked by the demutualization of the traditional exchanges they serve, are now under more pressure than ever to search for new sources of revenue. Moreover, to retain their existing clients, they are expected to continuously expand and improve their technology and services.
 
Indeed, regardless of whether you are talking about the Board of Trade Clearing Corp. (Botcc), the London Clearing House (LCH) or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME's) Clearing House division, the ability to wear multiple hats while filling the specific needs of different types of customers is integral to success. ""Just like the exchanges, clearing organizations are trying to reinvent themselves into traditional for-profit companies, almost as a way to try and ensure their survival,"" says a source close to the Botcc's board. 
 
Of course, there is no standard recipe for reinvention. All of the world's largest derivatives clearinghouses are leveraging their assets in the name of evolution, but their business models and strategies for growth vary significantly.  For example, the CME and Stockholm, Sweden-based OM have attempted to separate their internal clearinghouses from the pack by licensing their in-house developed clearing systems to derivatives markets across the globe. In contrast, in lieu of licensing its software, the independently owned LCH has expanded its reach and power by providing central counter-party transaction processing services to many different markets in its home country. 
 
Meanwhile, the Botcc is attempting to secure its future by offering its technology and services to up-and-coming B2B derivatives markets. In fact, to that end, the Botcc recently developed Meta-Clear, a comprehensive, Internet-based suite of applications that covers everything from traditional clearing to transaction processing and payment for over-the-counter derivatives. 
 
Unlike its clearinghouse counterparts, however, the Botcc has one potentially large stumbling block in its path: the looming demutualization of its largest client, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Though the Botcc, like the LCH, is independently owned, it still receives most of its revenues from the CBOT, which clears all of its U.S. transactions through the 76-year-old clearing firm. 
 
But the CBOT, following in the footsteps of other large derivatives markets like the CME, will probably eventually go for-profit-morphing from a member-owned exchange into a shareholder-driven market. And when it does, the management of the CBOT, facing pressure to increase profit from shareholders, may be forced to re-evaluate the exchange's long-standing clearing relationship with the Botcc. 
 
""There is no doubt that demutualization at the CBOT could potentially lead to other views being taken of the services provided by the Botcc. So the Botcc needs to diversify ... (because) it is, at the moment, a very undiversified entity,"" says a LCH official. 
 
Noting that the LCH provides central counter-party clearing services for the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the London Metal Exchange, the International Petroleum Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, eSpeed and EuroMTS-among other clients-the official says that the LCH has an edge because it is truly independent. What's more, he says that while other clearinghouses focus on licensing their derivatives-clearing software, the LCH differentiates itself by providing full-service clearing services for a variety of instruments. 
 
""Others lead the way by trailblazing new technology, we lead it by trailblazing new types of service,"" the official says. ""There is no other clearinghouse in the world that does futures and options, cash equities, interest-rate swaps and fixed income-in the form of repo and cash bonds."" 
 
That said, while expanding into new markets is part of the LCH's modus operandi, the firm currently has no aspirations to chase after B2B derivatives exchanges. The B2B marketplace today, says the LCH official, is too illiquid to derive any benefits from central counter-party clearing. ""All that a central counter-party is doing, with so few buyers and sellers within that space, is simply adding cost. So we just do not see an upside there,"" he says. 
 
Betting on B2B 
 
While the LCH is skeptical about B2B, the Botcc believes that the marketplace is ripe with untapped clearing opportunities. Thus far, the firm, which began its earnest pursuit of B2B in early 2000, has snagged two new clients: Opt4-a Berkeley, Calif.-based B2B trading systems vendor which the original Meta-Clear application suite was designed for-and Traiana-a developer of front-end applications targeted at online, B2B derivatives markets. 
 
In the last couple of years, the Botcc has also signed agreements to provide U.S. transaction-processing services to BrokerTec-an all-electronic interdealer-broker of fixed-income securities-and the St. Louis Merchants Exchange-a start-up market that trades large freight futures contracts. What's more, says Botcc President and CEO Dennis Dutterer, the clearing corporation will likely ink deals with ""two or three"" more participants in the B2B space by year end. 
 
Keeping all this in mind, Dutterer says the Botcc is confident that it can use its B2B strategy to diversify, while simultaneously maintaining its deal with the CBOT. 
 
Sixty-five percent of the Botcc's revenues, he says, come directly from transactions funneled to the firm through the CBOT, and an additional 25 percent is derived through ""capital"" and shareholder fund management. The remaining 10 percent comes from other revenue sources, including B2B clients. 
 
Still, though it clearly thinks B2B is an important market segment, Dutterer refuses to make any predictions about what percentage of Botcc's revenues will stem from B2B clients in the future. ""We have not targeted a year-end revenue change, because that type of thing does not occur overnight,"" he says. 
 
The source close to the Botcc's board of governors says that B2B truly presents a dilemma for the clearing corp. On the one hand, he says, the exchange-traded futures business is currently saturated-meaning very few clearing contracts remain up for grabs. However, though there may be as many as 50 new B2B markets, they have probably collectively traded only a few hundred contracts, the source says. 
 
""Their only chance to diversify in a big way is to score a home run with one of these B2B deals,"" he says. ""But at the end of the day, how much transactional B2B business is out there? Virtually none."" 
 
Integrated Approach 
 
OM, like the LCH, does not think today's B2B markets offer a lot of opportunities for clearing firms. Richard Dour, the sales and marketing head of the financial systems unit of OM's technology division, says that OM is not actively trying to license its standard clearing system-Secur-to B2B markets. Rather, OM has marketed Secur to traditional derivatives and energy exchanges, at times trying to take advantage of the breadth of technology platforms it offers. 
 
In addition to licensing its respective clearing systems on a standalone basis, OM and the CME can offer prospective clients something that the Botcc and LCH do not-an integrated trading engine/clearing system package. Together with its Clearing 21 platform, the CME offers exchange clients the ability to deploy Globex2-its trading engine-on an integrated basis. Similarly, OM can provide a combination of Secur and Click-its derivatives trading engine-for clients that desire an integrated solution. 
 
Citing the fact the CME has publicly declared its intent to investigate a potential IPO, Merc officials declined to be interviewed for this story. But Dour says OM's integrated Secur/Click offering has netted the company a few exchange clients. Indeed, he says that in addition to OM's own exchanges, the Korea Futures Exchange, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Athens Stock Exchange and Nordpool have selected the integrated Click/Secur package. 
 
The source close to the Botcc's board says that the integrated offerings definitely provide the CME and OM with an edge in the battle for clearing contracts. ""If you're a B2B or a new exchange, you need a trading vehicle and you need a clearing vehicle. They've got both of those systems, and the Botcc really only has one,"" says the source. 
 
However, citing the development of Meta-Clear and the clearing corp.'s new clients-as well as its 76 years of experience-the Botcc's Dutterer says his firm matches up well with every other clearinghouse. While conceding that the likes of the CME, OM and LCH may have a larger client base of exchange customers to refer potential clients to, Dutterer adds that customer references will not make or break any clearing deal. ""Large sophisticated organizations won't look solely at existing clients. They won't buy a Chevrolet just because their brother bought a Chevrolet. Rather, they will sit down and (evaluate) what features are offered,"" he says. 
 
The source close to the Botcc agrees that exchanges are looking deeper than just client references when they search for clearing solutions. However, he says that in the U.S., at least, the public perception is that the CME Clearing House is better positioned than the Botcc. """"I think the Botcc product line may be better than the CME's clearing offerings, but the Merc does a better job with marketing,"" the source says. 
 
The CME Clearing House, he elaborates, also has an edge because it is owned by an exchange that has already gone for-profit-and is therefore ""more aggressively"" seeking new business opportunities. That said, regardless of which Chicago clearinghouse holds an advantage today, rampant speculation about consolidation continues to cloud the future of the Botcc and CME Clearing House. 
 
A couple of years back, of course, those organizations signed a letter of intent to merge-but never finalized the deal. However, pointing to merger talks that took place earlier this year between the Botcc and the Options Clearing Corp., the source close to the Botcc says that consolidation, in the name of survival, is inevitable. 
 
""I don't really see a lot of opportunities for growth in the U.S. clearing market. Instead, I see consolidation. All of these clearing organizations in the U.S. are not going to make it,"" the source prognosticates.

"Re: Upcoming Board Meeting","Bob,

I was going to write you to propose an alternative meeting venue, but my
firm has issued a stricter prohibition on all overseas travel and US
domestic travel (which stranded my colleagues who are already abroad on
business trips=they have to stay there until further notice). This is in
response to the anthrax incidents and the FBI's terrorism alert.

But, apart from myself, it may be worthwhile considering changing the venue
of the board meeting of November and January to countries that are not
actively participating in the retaliation.
Among the cities in which board members reside, places like Amsterdam,
Madrid, Paris and Milan may be safer. Perhaps we could consider Singapore
and Switzerland, too.

You are right that agendas for these two meetings are very full and
telephone conferences are not adequate. We should meet in person somewhere.
We could split them into several consecutive days' telephone conferences but
you have to get up early and we (including Azam and Steve) would have to
stay up late.

RE:			Next Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting


Dear All,

ISDA would like to schedule a Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting next week. The
proposed dates are the following: October, 3rd, 4th or 5th at 11:00 am New
York time at ISDA. Please choose the date that is more convenient so that we
can make appropriate arrangements. As usual, we will provide a call in

ISDA is considering a visit to Brazil of several days in order to hold
meetings with the Central Bank as well as other regulators - NMC, e.g.,
market players, netting legislation contacts, lawyers working on master
agreement development, and others in order to further the agenda of the
Brazilian Subcommittee and to be able to prepare for the conference planned
for Brazil next year.

In preparation for our subcommittee meeting ISDA would like to obtain from
your institution a list (""Wish List"") of local OTC derivatives market issues
for ISDA to address as well as suggestions for meetings and organizations
with which ISDA might meet to address these issues. This ""Wish List"" will be
of enormous help to ISDA for purposes of having an adequate and focused
agenda for planning visits with a number of Brazilian institutions and
authorities. 

Please reply R.S.V.P. by email to Scott Marra (smarra@isda.org) if you would
like to attend.

From: 	Enron Europe General Announcement/ECT@ECT [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Europe+20General+20Announcement_ECT+40ECT@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Enron Europe Office of the Chairman
Sent:	04 October 2001 14:58
To:	ECT Europe@ENRON
Subject:	Organisational Announcement


Enron has had a very good year to date and we at Enron Europe have played our part in this.   However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.

We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the ""back burner""and reduce the scope of others.

This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.

Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.

We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

Bob,

I was going to write you to propose an alternative meeting venue, but my
firm has issued a stricter prohibition on all overseas travel and US
domestic travel (which stranded my colleagues who are already abroad on
business trips=they have to stay there until further notice). This is in
response to the anthrax incidents and the FBI's terrorism alert.

But, apart from myself, it may be worthwhile considering changing the venue
of the board meeting of November and January to countries that are not
actively participating in the retaliation.
Among the cities in which board members reside, places like Amsterdam,
Madrid, Paris and Milan may be safer. Perhaps we could consider Singapore
and Switzerland, too.

You are right that agendas for these two meetings are very full and
telephone conferences are not adequate. We should meet in person somewhere.
We could split them into several consecutive days' telephone conferences
but
you have to get up early and we (including Azam and Steve) would have to
stay up late.

Terry

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Computer Virus","
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW
  
09/24/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday. 
""I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market,"" concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case. 
The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said. 
""Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on,"" Cintron said. 
Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region. 
""The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers,"" the judge said. 
The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case. 
     
At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001. 
In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. 
The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December. 
Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission. 
""Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market,"" Cintron concluded. ""This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner."" 
""Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard,"" Cintron said. 
California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million). 
Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds. 
Cintron was persuaded by the ""ripple"" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds. 
""Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task,"" Cintron said. 
""The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market,"" the judge said. 
""Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale,"" she said. 
The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed. 
In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market. 
While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices. 
Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.

ME, THE MOMENT I PICK UP THE PHONE, YOU SHOULD ASK ME
FOR THE ""CODE WORD"" AND MY ANSWER WOULD BE ""GOD IS
GOOD"" BEFORE WE PROCEED DISCUSSIONS, BUT IF I DO NOT
SAY ""GOD IS GOOD"", THAT MEANS YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING
WITH ME JUST DISCONNECT THE LINE AND CALL ME BACK TILL
I GIVE YOU THE CODE WORD.

"Tozzini, Freire - Invitation - 25th anniversary","Auguste Rodin 
2001 


Auguste Rodin was a continuously surprising artist. Restless, argumentative, tormented, he was always in search of the feeling, the meaning underlying reality, going beyond the perfection of shape - a shape that sometimes is clearly presented and sometimes left to the imagination of the viewer.

To understand Rodin one has to stand before one of this Master's works, letting our perception slide over all of its turns and bends, discovering all of its nuances, knowing that shapes change and are transformed as time elapses while allowing us to discover the artist's intentions. 

  <http://www.tozzini.com.br/rodin/lgtfts.gif>It was not by chance that Tozzini, Freire, Teixeira e Silva Advogados made this choice to celebrate its 25th anniversary. The boldness, the search for one's own style, the daringness, the permanent questioning are part of Rodin, and yet they also represent our way of feeling and carrying out our professional activity. 

In commemoration of Tozzini, Freire, Teixeira e Silva Advogados' 25th anniversary, the firm has the pleasure of inviting you to the cocktail party that will open the exhibition of the works of the French artist Auguste Rodin.

"Patient but Not Passive","A colleague has sent you this article from Fortune (<http://www.fortune.com>).
Reply to your colleague at janette.elbertson@enron.com <mailto:janette.elbertson@enron.com>
Here's the article on Louise Kitchen.

MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Patient but Not Passive
A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswomen. She is strong and resolute, but not in a hurry. 
Patricia Sellers
Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2001



For some 30 years--ever since women started jockeying for power in the workplace--patience has gotten a bad rap. After all, the virtue fairly reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive wife and mother. So women have shunned it. Instead they have felt the need to make bold pronouncements and rush to action. That was never truer than during the season of dot-com mania, when every CEO professed to be leading a revolution. And any leader who failed to act quickly was supposed to get trampled by the capitalist vanguard. 

Now, in these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly. We're not talking about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or who sat passively in an out-of-the-way corner. Rather, they stayed with a company, steadily building influence there, and rose to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion. These qualities, of course, serve men as well as women. Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, argues that the most successful corporate turnarounds were led by such colorless men as Darwin Smith at Kimberly-Clark and William Allen at Boeing. Through a combination of deep knowledge of the corporation, personal humility, and will, they created enduring greatness. It's too early to say whether Anne Mulcahy, No. 6 on our list, can pull off such a feat. But she fits the profile. An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO, she felt ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July. ""I'm not as famous as Carly--and I want to keep it that way,"" says Mulcahy, 48. 

The famous Carly--Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorina--is still No. 1 on our list, as she has been every year since we began publishing the The Power 50 in 1998. She still heads the biggest company ($48.8 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move--a bold bet to buy competitor Compaq--but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. As a woman--and a daring, outspoken one at that--her actions are scrutinized more closely than the most driven of men. Says Fiorina: ""I've had a lot of male CEOs say to me, 'Thank God they don't rank us.' "" 

PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi (No. 10) understands the urge to take bold action, but she also knows the necessity of holding back. ""There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a higher level--which is why women tend to push themselves harder than men,"" says Nooyi, 46. ""But we have to have the right people around who can say to us, 'You're draining the organization. You're pushing too hard.' "" Particularly now, as the U.S. prepares for an uncertain kind of war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn, power seems to call for pragmatic and careful leadership. 

This year's Power 50 is full of such steady leaders. Mulcahy, Nooyi, and the other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year--Mirant's Marce Fuller (No. 5), Pfizer's Karen Katen (No. 7), Chevron's Pat Woertz (No. 8), and Kraft's Betsy Holden (No. 9)--are all low-profile loyalists. The combined tenure at their current companies: 118 years. The six years Andrea Jung (No. 4) spent as head of marketing at Avon gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone expected when she became CEO two years ago (see It Took a Lady to Save Avon). 

As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: eBay's Meg Whitman, No. 2 on our list. Whitman, who at times took heat for not managing aggressively enough, has never overpromised investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter.

While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use to evaluate power remains the same. We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career--where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list. She owns a product, The Oprah Winfrey Show, that generates more than $300 million in annual revenues and reaches 26 million viewers in the U.S. each week--plus millions more in 106 international markets. Her show, and now her magazine, O, The Oprah Magazine (whose subject is personal empowerment), have immense influence on the popular culture--from what books people read to what kind of lives they lead. 

The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers and three returnees from previous years. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. (Unless she wields media power like Martha Stewart, No. 13.) This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more. That's a first. The ranking has become so competitive, in fact, that some women moved down even though their power increased. Example: Shelly Lazarus. She heads a healthy business, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where, by the way, she has worked for 30 years), whose revenues grew 20% last year. Plus, she added a prestigious board seat--General Electric--to her resume. But in order to make room for newcomers, Lazarus slides to No. 11, from No. 7 last year. 

One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20). Loyalty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never imagined while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt. Barrett couldn't afford to go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond believing she ""would be the best legal secretary in the world,"" she says. Barrett started as Herb Kelleher's secretary in 1967, a decade before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines. She made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be America's top-performing airline. In her job as executive vice president of customers, she helped create Southwest's famously collegial culture and provided essential structure and discipline to Kelleher's grand vision. ""I've never wanted the CEO job,"" says Barrett. ""I don't think I have the talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person."" Now 57, Barrett is exactly where she wants to be. 

Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their companies to change and grow, and they take personal risks. ""Women have to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,"" says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great marks running international project development for Mirant's former parent, Southern, in 1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the company's tiny North American power plant operations. After looking closely at the business, she told her boss she didn't want the job unless she could do something altogether new--build a high-tech risk-management and marketing organization to complement the expansion of power plants in the U.S. ""I told him, 'If you don't have this piece, you don't have a game plan,' "" she says. It wasn't an easy sell. Only 35 at the time, Fuller lobbied Southern's board for approval. Once she got it, she built a 600-person energy trading and marketing unit that is expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. Southern, a regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller is her own boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest companies this year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO. 

One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of FORTUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in the pipeline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago. ""When I was 21, I was expecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty-fifty range,"" says Betsy Bernard (No. 23), CEO of AT&T Consumer. The reality, though disappointing, has motivated Bernard to become ""a catalyst, making sure that other women get opportunities."" Bernard, 46, and other women emerging now are not based on the old model--the shark-like Linda Wachner, whose company, Warnaco, crashed into bankruptcy this year. Or the flamboyant Jill Barad, who was booted from Mattel last year. Says PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi: ""PepsiCo, which used to be known for hiring 'Pepsi pretty'--blond, blue-eyed males--has made an Indian woman its president. That says a lot about the future of women."" Let's hope Nooyi is right. Meantime, if you don't see a new Wonder Woman in corporate America, it doesn't mean she doesn't exist. She might be quietly and diligently doing her job.

"Implementation of Form Setoff Language:   EOL Transactions","
Due to the extent of work required to modify our annexes, GTCs etc. on EOL (IT coordination, counterparty notification and the like) and the traders' strong preference to not often make changes on EOL product documentation, we propose to implement the EOL form change in one aggregate revision as and when the trading forms committee concludes its work on events of default and termination valuation/remedies.  Should you think this should be handled differently, please advise.  Mary

"FW: Peaker Plant","Suggestions? Thanks.

Subject: Peaker Plant


Chuck,

When in Houston, I mentioned we had a site near Clinton, Iowa, that may be
optimum for a peaker electricity plant.  We aren't totally sure where the
Northern Border Pipeline crosses the Mississippi but its got to be
relatively close.  We know several pipelines are in the area.  The ones
currently feeding this site are too small to serve a peaker plant, but they
have to be coming from a larger source nearby.  The site is also adjacent to
major electricity lines.

I'd like to take you up on your offer to put us in touch with someone at
Enron, to whom we can discuss the location and determine if there is any
interest on Enron's part in the potential project.  Of course, we're
interested in being involved where our services are needed.

Let me know who to contact.

Phil

"V&E","
I spoke with Joe Dilg over the weekend regarding V&E's assistance with respect to questions/issues surrounding our structured finance vehicles.  He advised that V&E retained Williams & Connally to represent them in connection with inquiries made of V&E by the Special Committee.  Williams & Connally apparently has interviewed the V&E individuals involved in the vehicles/transactions and has compiled quite a bit of info re the same.  Joe advised that as we pose questions to V&E, they will involve Williams & Connally to make certain that the answers that we receive are consistent with information provided to the Special Committee. Please keep this in mind as inquiries are made to V&E.  Thanks and hope that each of you have a very happy new year!   Regards,  Julia

MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Patient but Not Passive
A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswomen. She is strong and resolute, but not in a hurry. 
Patricia Sellers
Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2001



For some 30 years--ever since women started jockeying for power in the workplace--patience has gotten a bad rap. After all, the virtue fairly reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive wife and mother. So women have shunned it. Instead they have felt the need to make bold pronouncements and rush to action. That was never truer than during the season of dot-com mania, when every CEO professed to be leading a revolution. And any leader who failed to act quickly was supposed to get trampled by the capitalist vanguard. 

Now, in these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly. We're not talking about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or who sat passively in an out-of-the-way corner. Rather, they stayed with a company, steadily building influence there, and rose to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion. These qualities, of course, serve men as well as women. Jim Collins, author of Good to Great, argues that the most successful corporate turnarounds were led by such colorless men as Darwin Smith at Kimberly-Clark and William Allen at Boeing. Through a combination of deep knowledge of the corporation, personal humility, and will, they created enduring greatness. It's too early to say whether Anne Mulcahy, No. 6 on our list, can pull off such a feat. But she fits the profile. An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO, she felt ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July. ""I'm not as famous as Carly--and I want to keep it that way,"" says Mulcahy, 48. 

The famous Carly--Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorina--is still No. 1 on our list, as she has been every year since we began publishing the The Power 50 in 1998. She still heads the biggest company ($48.8 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move--a bold bet to buy competitor Compaq--but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. As a woman--and a daring, outspoken one at that--her actions are scrutinized more closely than the most driven of men. Says Fiorina: ""I've had a lot of male CEOs say to me, 'Thank God they don't rank us.' "" 

PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi (No. 10) understands the urge to take bold action, but she also knows the necessity of holding back. ""There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a higher level--which is why women tend to push themselves harder than men,"" says Nooyi, 46. ""But we have to have the right people around who can say to us, 'You're draining the organization. You're pushing too hard.' "" Particularly now, as the U.S. prepares for an uncertain kind of war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn, power seems to call for pragmatic and careful leadership. 

This year's Power 50 is full of such steady leaders. Mulcahy, Nooyi, and the other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year--Mirant's Marce Fuller (No. 5), Pfizer's Karen Katen (No. 7), Chevron's Pat Woertz (No. 8), and Kraft's Betsy Holden (No. 9)--are all low-profile loyalists. The combined tenure at their current companies: 118 years. The six years Andrea Jung (No. 4) spent as head of marketing at Avon gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone expected when she became CEO two years ago (see It Took a Lady to Save Avon). 

As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: eBay's Meg Whitman, No. 2 on our list. Whitman, who at times took heat for not managing aggressively enough, has never overpromised investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter.

While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use to evaluate power remains the same. We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career--where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list. She owns a product, The Oprah Winfrey Show, that generates more than $300 million in annual revenues and reaches 26 million viewers in the U.S. each week--plus millions more in 106 international markets. Her show, and now her magazine, O, The Oprah Magazine (whose subject is personal empowerment), have immense influence on the popular culture--from what books people read to what kind of lives they lead. 

The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers and three returnees from previous years. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. (Unless she wields media power like Martha Stewart, No. 13.) This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more. That's a first. The ranking has become so competitive, in fact, that some women moved down even though their power increased. Example: Shelly Lazarus. She heads a healthy business, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where, by the way, she has worked for 30 years), whose revenues grew 20% last year. Plus, she added a prestigious board seat--General Electric--to her resume. But in order to make room for newcomers, Lazarus slides to No. 11, from No. 7 last year. 

One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20). Loyalty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never imagined while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt. Barrett couldn't afford to go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond believing she ""would be the best legal secretary in the world,"" she says. Barrett started as Herb Kelleher's secretary in 1967, a decade before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines. She made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be America's top-performing airline. In her job as executive vice president of customers, she helped create Southwest's famously collegial culture and provided essential structure and discipline to Kelleher's grand vision. ""I've never wanted the CEO job,"" says Barrett. ""I don't think I have the talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person."" Now 57, Barrett is exactly where she wants to be. 

Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their companies to change and grow, and they take personal risks. ""Women have to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,"" says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great marks running international project development for Mirant's former parent, Southern, in 1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the company's tiny North American power plant operations. After looking closely at the business, she told her boss she didn't want the job unless she could do something altogether new--build a high-tech risk-management and marketing organization to complement the expansion of power plants in the U.S. ""I told him, 'If you don't have this piece, you don't have a game plan,' "" she says. It wasn't an easy sell. Only 35 at the time, Fuller lobbied Southern's board for approval. Once she got it, she built a 600-person energy trading and marketing unit that is expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. Southern, a regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller is her own boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest companies this year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO. 

One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of FORTUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in the pipeline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago. ""When I was 21, I was expecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty-fifty range,"" says Betsy Bernard (No. 23), CEO of AT&T Consumer. The reality, though disappointing, has motivated Bernard to become ""a catalyst, making sure that other women get opportunities."" Bernard, 46, and other women emerging now are not based on the old model--the shark-like Linda Wachner, whose company, Warnaco, crashed into bankruptcy this year. Or the flamboyant Jill Barad, who was booted from Mattel last year. Says PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi: ""PepsiCo, which used to be known for hiring 'Pepsi pretty'--blond, blue-eyed males--has made an Indian woman its president. That says a lot about the future of women."" Let's hope Nooyi is right. Meantime, if you don't see a new Wonder Woman in corporate America, it doesn't mean she doesn't exist. She might be quietly and diligently doing her job.

Bank of England warns on trading practices
IFR - December 15, 2001

The Bank of England (BoE) last week sounded warnings about the increasing
use of credit derivatives to transfer credit risk and counterparty risk
management practices.  Its half-yearly financial stability review examined
the transfer of credit risk between the banking and insurance sectors. It
noted that markets for risk transfer are, in principle, beneficial because
they allow greater dispersion of risk.

However, the BoE said that it is important for regulators to track whether
or not concentrations of risk might decline in some places only to re-emerge
in others. In particular it cited unfunded risk transfer as being difficult
to monitor. ""If flows of risk are not accompanied by flows of funds
(insurance or derivatives), they become harder to track in aggregate,"" the
report said.

The review discussed possible areas where seemingly transferred credit risk
by banks could revert to the sector. It said that some techniques used in
deals such as synthetic securitisations can leave banks with residual risks,
whether contractual or implicit.  ""The credit default swap market has not
really been tested under a severe downside scenario and if the worst happens
and the whole house falls down people may well find that none of their risk
has actually been transferred,"" said one analyst who was sympathetic to the
BoE's line.

Credit derivatives dealers are more sanguine, however. ""Often you have no
option but to use credit derivatives to back up transactions. They can be
used to get round regulatory and sourcing difficulties and some times they
are just quicker and cheaper than the alternatives,"" said one dealer.  The
BoE also said that even in the instances where banks have genuinely
transferred credit risk, there is a question as to whether the appetite of
the risk takers will be sustained. ""General insurers, reinsurers and life
insurers might reduce their asset allocation to credit risk if losses were
to increase materially during the current economic slowdown,"" said the
report.

The banks active in the credit derivatives market are confident that their
risk transfer techniques work, but admit that losses for insurance company
sellers of protection could threaten the continuing growth of the market.
The BoE also questioned the extent to which the banking system can change
from being the 'originator and holder' to 'originator and distributor' of
credit risk, saying that this may be limited by the close link between
credit and provision of liquidity.

""Credit risk is being transferred from banks to insurance companies. But if
credit losses crystallise in stressed market conditions, insurance companies
may need to have recourse to the banking system in order to meet their
obligations under credit risk transfer instruments,"" the report said.
Elsewhere in its review, the BoE examined counterparty risk management and
found that disclosure practice is still not sufficient to facilitate
effective management. It said that banks have growing exposure to non-bank
participants in over-the-counter derivatives and other capital markets, such
as insurance companies, energy companies and large multinationals.

The recommendations of the official and private sector reports on
counterparty risk management following the LTCM crisis were addressed
particularly to banks' hedge fund exposure. However, the Enron case shows
that many apply more widely, particularly the need for counterparties to
make adequate financial disclosure.

Vulture firms begin to set their sights on troubled Argentina 
Financial Times - December 19, 2001

Edward Bozaan says he made money in Russia and Thailand soon after they
devalued their currencies in the late 1990s. Now, the New York-based fund
manager is considering buying assets in Argentina, Bloomberg reports.

""I buy into extraordinarily depressed markets, and Argentina is definitely
on my screen right now,"" says the 44-year old president of Waterford
Partners, a fund management company whose promotional material contains
pictures of tanks and explosions. ""Its markets are really scraping bottom.""

As the country nears default on most of its Dollars 132bn debt and struggles
to avert devaluation, Mr Bozaan says he and others who specialise in
investing in countries in crisis are assessing whether prices have reached
bottom after the Merval stock index fell to 10-year lows and bonds
plummeted.

Mr Bozaan's fund grew 114 per cent in 1999, helped by his purchase of
Russian companies such as Vimpelcom Communications after the country
defaulted on Dollars 40bn of debt and devalued the rouble. In the first nine
months of this year the fund lost 17.9 per cent, compared with 26.6 per cent
drop in the MSCI Emerging Market Index.

Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister, blamed foreign funds such as Mr
Bozaan's for the country's troubles, saying they drove down stock and bond
values and pushed up interest rates. That forced the government last week to
limit deposit withdrawals to prevent a collapse of the banking system, Mr
Cavallo said.

""They are the same (funds) that got rich in Russia in 1998 and who attacked
Ecuador and hurt the Ecuadorean people,"" Mr Cavallo said in a speech. ""The
same funds have been focused on Argentina in 2001.""

While many describe companies such as Waterford as vulture funds, Mr Bozaan
says he is not responsible for driving down Argentine markets. ""Some see my
business as morbid, but it wasn't me who brought down the prices,"" says Mr
Bozaan. ""I see value in markets after they've been battered.""

In fact, any fund that buys Argentine securities would help the economy,
says Charles Cassel, who helps manage Dollars 450m in emerging market assets
at Standard Asset Management. ""Vulture funds are a beneficiary to the
economy in that they provide an inflow of capital at a time when it
desperately needs it,"" he says.

Mr Bozaan uses studies of past financial crises elsewhere as a guide to when
prices may recover. ""I strongly believe Argentina will become one of the
best- performing markets in the world some day and that's when we'll make
our money,"" says Mr Bozaan, who typically acquires shares that have dropped
60 per cent to 70 per cent in a market where the benchmark index has lost 50
per cent.

By Mr Bozaan's rule, he should already be investing in Argentina. Since
January 1, the Merval has dropped by half and leading stocks such as Grupo
Financiera Galicia, a bank holding company, have fallen more than two
thirds. The benchmark floating rate bond due in 2005 gained a second day to
yield about 60 per cent. The Merval, now trading at levels last seen in
March 1991, rose 1.5 per cent.

""There are many corporate stocks and bonds that would be extremely
interesting once uncertainty over the government's restructuring and future
is cleared up,"" says Richard Segal, director of research at Exotix, ICAP's
London-based debt brokerage.

Mr Bozaan says he has not yet invested because he believes the government
may devalue the peso, which was fixed at par with the US dollar in 1991 and
is a key reason, economists say, why Argentine industry is unable to compete
with cheaper imports.

""There's definitely more downside to come,"" says Mr Bozaan. ""I want to see
some resolution in what the government will do. If Argentina devalues after
I've bought, the fund could lose a lot of money.""  Mr Bozaan says his
interest in Argentina has grown as the country suffers an increase in public
protests against rising unemployment and cuts in government spending on
salaries, pensions and health.

""I bought after China's Tianenmen Square massacre, Peru's Shining Path
crisis and Thailand's riots,"" he says. ""Argentina's not quite on that scale,
but its situation isn't good."" Among shares Mr Bozaan may buy are Grupo
Financiera Galicia, Telecom Argentina Stet-France Telecom and Perez Companc,
an oil company.

Group Galicia trades at about 2.8 times past earnings compared with Banco
Bradesco, a Brazilian bank that trades at 8.1 times earnings, and Citigroup
of the US, which trades at 17 times. Telecom Argentina trades at 14 times
earnings against 27 times for Brasil Telecom. Perez Companc trades at 7.2
times earnings compared with BP's 13 per cent.  Mr Segal recommends buying
bank and utility bonds. ""Grupo Galicia and Banco Rio look like good buys; so
do some of the telecom and electricity companies,"" he says.

Telefonica bids to shield at-risk Brazil interests 
Financial Times - December 19, 2001
By Leslie Crawford and Krishna Guha

Telefonica of Spain, the largest foreign investor in Latin America, has used
derivatives to hedge against a possible devaluation in Argentina and any
risk of that country's financial crisis spilling over into neighbouring
Brazil.  Cesar Alierta, Telefonica chairman, told the Financial Times: ""The
crisis in Argentina is not a Latin American crisis. We are confident that
Brazil has decoupled from Argentina's problems.""

Telefonica has more than Euros 35bn (Dollars 31.6bn) invested in Latin
America. The region provides 41 per cent of its revenues, which totalled
Euros 23bn in the first nine months of the year, and almost 45 per cent of
the company's cash flow.  Telefonica would not disclose the size of its
hedging operations, but said its derivatives portfolio is significant.
Executives said: ""We are not immune to the effects of a devaluation, but we
will be less affected than the market thinks.""

There should be no need to write down the value of its assets in the event
of a devaluation of the Argentine peso, which has been pegged to the dollar
for a decade. Telefonica said it has budgeted for a rise in unpaid telephone
bills as the crisis in Argentina bites. Operating revenues at TASA,
Telefonica's Argentine subsidiary, were down 5 per cent in the first nine
months of the year.  Mr Alierta, however, is bullish about prospects in
Brazil, where Telefonica has invested Dollars 17bn.

Telefonica owns Telesp, which has 12m clients and is the largest fixed-line
operator in the prosperous industrial state of Sao Paulo. Early next year it
hopes to pool its mobile interests in several Brazilian states with Portugal
Telecom's big mobile operation in Sao Paulo.  ""With 1,200 lines per
employee, Telesp is probably the most efficient operator in the world,"" Mr
Alierta said. He is particularly enthusiastic about the potential for
broadband communications in Brazil.""

Armey Would Split Derivatives Issue From Stalled Bankruptcy Reform Bill 
BNA - December 19, 2001

Despite opposition from House Judiciary Committee leadership, House Majority
Leader Richard Armey (R-Texas) told BNA Dec. 18 he wants the House to take
up contract netting legislation apart from the stalled bankruptcy reform
bill (H.R. 333) to which it is attached. 

""I think it is time to move netting,"" Armey said, using another name for the
derivatives bill. ""They [members of the Judiciary Committee], see netting as
a very important kind of a driving engine within their bill. And I
appreciate their point of view, but I think this is something that needs to
get completed, and I have talked to the committee about it repeatedly."" 

House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) is against
consideration of financial derivatives legislation apart from bankruptcy
reform legislation, which has been stuck in conference for months, a
Sensenbrenner aide told BNA Dec. 14. 

Contract netting language intended to reduce uncertainty and limit systemic
risk in derivatives transactions was added to the bankruptcy bill at a time
when Republican leadership was optimistic the legislation could pass this
year and that its inclusion could help speed the process, House staff told
BNA. 

""Hindsight is 20-20,"" a House Republican aide told BNA. ""Who knew the
[bankruptcy] bill would be grounded again?"" 

Sensenbrenner and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Michael Oxley
(R-Ohio) met with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan Dec. 13 to
discuss the importance of legislation addressing banks' use of financial
derivatives (239 DER A-28, 12/14/01). 

Oxley strongly supports passing derivatives legislation this year, according
to his spokeswoman, especially in light of the recent collapse of Enron
Corp., which traded heavily in derivatives. 

Even if a derivatives bill fails to pass Congress again this year, its
separate consideration would indicate just what poor odds Republican
leadership places on bankruptcy reform passing in the foreseeable future. 

Presumably, if the House took up a derivatives bill, it would vote on an
independent contract netting bill (H.R. 3211) that Rep. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.)
introduced on Nov. 1. Its language is identical to language contained in
numerous contract netting bills offered as far back as 1998, when then-House
Banking Committee Chairman James Leach (R-Iowa) championed the issue. 

Currently, no companion bill exists in the Senate. Although Democrats,
particularly members of the House-Senate conference on H.R. 333 who oppose
bankruptcy reform, are likely to support passage of a contract netting bill,
it is unclear whether key Republicans would. 

A spokeswoman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a member of the bankruptcy
reform conference, told BNA that the senator is likely to oppose separating
contract netting from H.R. 333. 

Derivatives are financial contracts used by parties wishing to hedge the
risk of fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or indexes.
Their value is based on the performance of an underlying asset. Seven large
commercial banks account for about 96 percent of all derivatives, the most
common of which is an interest rate contract.

I thought we could all use some good news.  The recent American Lawyer associates survey -- which ranked us as the best law firm in California and ninth best in the country -- capped off a year of tremendous accolades to McCutchen.  These honors are the result of our firm values, our mutual commitment to each other and a lot of hard work. The challenge of the coming year will be not just to maintain these distinctions, but to do even better.  In the meantime, I wanted to share these with you because we all should be very proud of ourselves.

Fortune magazine lists McCutchen as one of ""The 100 Best Companies to Work for in the U.S.""  (January 2001).

Ranked #1 as having the largest percentage of female attorneys (and the second highest percentage of female equity partners) among the top 250 law firms in the country. (National Law Journal, December 2000).

Ranked one of the ""25 Most Diverse Law Firms in America"" (Minority Law Journal, December 2000).

Ranked #1 law firm in California and #6 in the country for commitment to pro bono work (American Lawyer, August 2001).

Ranked #1 in California (#9 in the country) in AmLaw's Annual Associates Survey (American Lawyer, October 2001).

Vault's Guide to the Top 100 Law Firms ranks McCutchen one of the ""100 Most Prestigious Law Firms in the country (Winter 2001).

McCutchen's environmental practice is ranked in the top 3 nationwide (American Lawyer, October 2000). 

McCutchen lawyers defended two of the top ten defense cases in California in 2000 (Daily Journal's Verdicts & Settlements, April 2001).

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

  Of course, our large competitors' databases have been a work in progress for generations. But, times have changed. A judicial opinion does not take on greater precedential value merely because it's fed to you via a WestLaw pipeline. It just costs more to read it. If you take a look at the searchable case law database you'll have UNLIMITED access to with TheLaw.net we stack up quite nicely, particularly when you consider the price.
See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

?UNRESOLVED MANAGEMENT ISSUES

  Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues when it comes to choosing legal research resources?

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search all states or all Federal and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)


""I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!""

     And there you have our new favorite quote, from a new subscriber leaving a large firm to start her own thing. We have others; lots of them. See, http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription to our Solo Edition. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

--Have a case citation you need to know more about? Find cases construing that item in one mouse click. Simple.

--PERFORM KNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Field search by cite, party, counsel, docket, author, date or panel.  See, http://www.thelaw.net/help/operators.htm

Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process","The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

STRONG BUY
Target Price: 25.00 (US$)
Enron Corp. (ENE)
10Q Info Consistent With Plusses For DYN In Deal

Summary

ENE filed its 3Q'01 10Q last night with information ranging from updates on
accounting restatements, balance sheet details and discussions of off-balance
sheet obligations.

Important disclosures were made related to acceleration of debt repayment due to
recent credit rating downgrades, reduced 4Q'01 eps expectations and liquidity.

ENE has $690 million in debt due on Nov 27 because of recent downgrades. We
expect this obligation to be renegotiated, satisfied out of the current cash
position of $1.5 billion or collateralized.

A reduction in 4Q'01 eps expectations because of ENE issues and other items was
part of our recent estimate reduction from $0.48 to $0.40 for 4Q'01, (before
non-
recurring items) discussed in a report dated Nov 5, 2001. We now expect 4Q eps
to be in a $0.25-$0.35 range.

Also in the 10Q, ENE describes other items discussed in the conference call of
Nov 14 including $8 billion of ""non-core"" (principally international and
broadband assets) that are for sale, an ability to issue $2 billion of
additional equity before the Dynegy (DYN, 43.60, Strong Buy) deal closes and a
total debt balance of $16.3 billion ($13.0 ""on balance sheet"" and $3.3 billion
""off balance sheet"").

The ""material adverse change (MAC)"" clause in the DYN/ENE deal was described as
considered if other ENE liabilities (primarily litigation) exceed $2 billion net
of insurance or reserves. If an additional $1.5 billion in liabilities is
assessed a MAC is deemed to have occurred.

In assessing a 90% probability that the DYN/ENE deal will be completed, we note
that ENE is not a going concern without it, DYN demonstrably benefits by it
(please see report dated Nov 9,'01) and Chevron/Texaco (CVX, 82.91) supports it.
In our view, positive comments by CVX yesterday, and the $1.5 billion cash
infusion to ENE from CVX on Nov 13, add to the support shown for the deal.

We continue to rate DYN Strong Buy because of its earnings and valuation upside
potential in this deal. Our current eps est for DYN of $2.55 for '02 moves to
$3.25 or higher with a completed deal. Our DYN target price of $54 is subject to
upward revision as well. For ENE, our Strong Buy rating expects that the deal
spread, currently about 30% will narrow as progress is made toward a closing.

Reliant Energy Proceeds with Corporate Restructuring, Bucking Turnaround of Industry Trend 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from PRNewswire] Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI) shareholders approved on Dec. 17 a major step in a corporate restructuring that will ultimately divide the company into a regulated energy-delivery company named CenterPoint Energy and a competitive energy services provider called Reliant Resources. 

Analysis: It is somewhat surprising that Reliant Energy is proceeding with its massive restructuring, which it acknowledges is being done to maximize shareholder value, considering how dramatically the market has changed since the company first announced its plans about 17 months ago. In July 2000, Reliant's plans to bifurcate its operations were just the latest in a string of similar restructuring initiatives from companies such as Southern Co. and Xcel Energy, both of which spun off high-growth, unregulated subsidiaries into stand-alone companies in very successful IPOs. Fast forward a year later and the splitting of regulated operations from unregulated operations into two stand-alone companies no longer appears to be a sure-fire business decision. For example, companies such as Constellation Energy and Allegheny Energy, which announced plans to engage in this kind of restructuring activity after Reliant's announcements, now have backpedaled and put such plans on hold. The details among the companies may be different, but the end result is pretty much the same: splintering an integrated company into two operations to attract two sets of investors. At the onset of the plans, the real appeal was to put unregulated power generation into a separately traded company and sell lots of stock. That sounded like a great idea last year when the independent power producer (IPP) market was going gangbusters. Now, demand and prices have dropped, and the merchant energy industry is shrouded in uncertainty. Into these rocky waters, Reliant Energy is about the only company that still believes a major restructuring is presently a wise move. 

As noted, Reliant's restructuring plans have been in motion for over a year, so in fairness to the company, it may be making the decision to proceed with the risky initiative in hopes that investors will still be receptive. The IPO of subsidiary Reliant Resources, held in May 2001, raised about $1.56 billion and was considered one of the most successful offerings this year. Reliant Energy presently owns a little more than 80 percent of Reliant Resources, whose business model is focused primarily on wholesale power marketing, maintaining generating and trading assets, and selling retail energy. Quite naturally, Reliant is hoping for a repeat of that success when the spin-off is completed in the first quarter of 2002.

Let's be clear about what Reliant is doing with this restructuring plan. What shareholders approved this week was the formation of a new holding company called CenterPoint Energy, which will include both the company's regulated energy-delivery business and Reliant Resources. The creation of a new holding company and accompanying name change are being characterized as interim steps that Reliant is taking toward the ultimate separation of the unregulated and regulated businesses. After receiving regulatory approvals from the IRS and SEC, shares of Reliant Energy will be automatically converted into shares of CenterPoint Energy, which will trade under the symbol CEP on the New York and Chicago Stock Exchanges. Trading for Reliant Energy, under the symbol REI, will be discontinued at that point. 

As the next step in the restructuring, pending an additional round of regulatory approvals, CenterPoint Energy will spin off the regulated company by distributing its shares of Reliant Resources to its shareholders, creating two separately owned public companies. Ultimately, CenterPoint Energy will own only the regulated side of the business, including electricity transmission and distribution, natural-gas distribution, pipelines, and any power generation facilities that remain regulated. 

Reliant's motivations to divide itself into two companies are pretty straightforward. On one hand, the company is simply complying with the regulatory mandates of Texas, which require that state utilities establish firewalls between their operating companies and create separate businesses for generation, energy services, distribution, etc. Yet, more importantly, Reliant is turning the mandate into a potential financial opportunity by establishing two public companies with dramatically different risk / reward profiles. The unregulated side will include such businesses as power generation, marketing and trading, and the European operations. The regulated side will include the businesses related to electricity and natural-gas distribution as well as the company's U.S. interstate pipelines. Note that the company previously indicated plans to sell its communications unit, which has struggled amid a larger market downturn in this sector. Thus, once the restructuring is completed, CenterPoint will be aimed at the traditional type of utility investor, which expects steady returns and reliable dividend income, while Reliant Resources will be more geared toward investors with a high tolerance for risk that want to take advantage of competitive opportunities in the deregulating wholesale market. 

Reliant Energy's CEO Steve Letbetter recently said he expects CenterPoint's dividend payout to be comparable to other regulated utilities, suggesting a payout greater than 50 percent of earnings per share. The company had already projected that CenterPoint's earnings per share for 2002 will fall in the range of $1.17 to $1.22. 

As I mentioned, however, economic conditions in the energy industry have changed considerably since Reliant announced its restructuring plans over a year ago, and the new industry climate may make the company's decisions to proceed with its plans a risky move. Again, I will point to the examples of Constellation and Allegheny, which really seemed to be caught in the crossfire of the restructuring trend and are still sorting through residual fallout. At the time of their original restructuring announcements, both Constellation and Allegheny had grounds to be fairly confident of their plans, considering how high the valuations for independent generating companies were running at that time. 

Yet, in a fast-changing market, those valuations have dropped considerably and the shares of both companies received some major hits related to this decline. Constellation shares were trading at about $50 in May 2001, but presently are priced at half that figure. Allegheny is down about 39 percent from its high of $55 a share to $33. While the drop in share price that these two companies have faced cannot be totally attributed to their restructuring plans, the important point is that companies that planned to restructure have done so to put more emphasis on their unregulated trading operations, a sector that has been undervalued. This point can be supported by looking at companies that have completed their restructuring processes (such as NRG Energy and Mirant), which are trading at 40 to 50 percent below their 52-week highs. Clearly, investor confidence in such companies has been eroded. By the same token, shares of Reliant Energy are trading at about $24, down from a 52-week high of $50, while shares of Reliant Resources are trading at about $15, down from a high of $37.50. This could be related to investors' concerns about the company's plans to proceed with restructuring in the current market climate. 

Moreover, a year ago the concept of utility restructuring to separate regulated operations from unregulated businesses seemed like a quick way for companies to cash in on the opportunities created by deregulated energy markets. In fact, it was the expectation of companies involved in the restructuring to gain a 20-plus P/E ratio for the unregulated company once it had been split off from the regulated business. However, the actual process of restructuring, which can take a year or more, is taking place under less-than-conducive market conditions, including a drop in energy prices, reduced demand and warnings of an energy glut. The original purpose of the restructuring plans (that is, to give shareholders increased value) is no longer a guaranteed result for companies that proceed with the separation plan, as Constellation and Allegheny clearly found. Only time will tell if Reliant's completed restructuring plan will prove to be another success or another failure in the energy industry, but it is a fairly safe bet that Reliant is one of the last companies that will be riding the restructuring trend any time soon. 

Ironically, one company that routinely has been praised for its strategy this year is Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK), which made a pointed decision to ignore the restructuring trend and remain an integrated company. In addition to recently being named Energy Company of the Year at the 2001 Financial Times Global Energy Awards, Duke's financials remain quite strong. For the third quarter 2001, Duke reported a 46-percent increase in ongoing earnings per share, or $1.02 per share. Year-to-date earnings per share from ongoing operations as of Sept. 30 were $2.30 compared to $1.63 for the same period last year. For year-end 2001, Duke remains committed to delivering earnings growth within a stated guidance of 10- to 15-percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of $2.10 in 2000. Looking ahead to 2002, Duke expects to earn toward the high end of the 10- to 15-percent range. When asked to establish reasons for the company's success, Duke Energy CEO Richard Priory mentioned the decision to remain an integrated company against a trend of other companies splintering apart. 


Other Reliant Resources News:
Shareholders of Orion Power Holdings (NYSE: ORN) overwhelmingly approved the merger agreement between Orion and Reliant Resources, which was announced last September. Under the agreement, Reliant is buying Orion for $26.80 per share in a cash transaction valued at approximately $2.9 billion. Reliant Resources will also assume approximately $1.8 billion of Orion Power's net debt. The companies anticipate that the transaction will be completed in early 2002, at which time Orion Power's business will be combined with Reliant Resources' domestic wholesale group. 

When previously discussing this acquisition (please see the 9/28/01 IssueAlert available at www.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/rci>), I established five reasons why Reliant is buying Orion, which also support the assessment that it is a strategic purchase. These reasons are as follows: 1) Reliant Resources gains Orion's generating assets, which support its own expanding wholesale business; 2) Orion's assets are primarily located in the Northeast, particularly in New York, which (unlike Reliant's core territory) offers a fully functional deregulated wholesale market; 3) Facing economic downturns and the possible softening of demand, Reliant Resources' acquisition of Orion is expected to immediately keep earnings solid, while other competitors are lowering their own earnings expectations; 4) The purchase illustrates the spate of consolidation efforts that are taking place in the independent power producing market; and 5) The purchase supports Reliant Resources' intentions to focus exclusively on North America and divest its European assets.

Why Enron investors are running for the exits 

It's all about risk -- and the Houston energy company may be on the hook for billions. Bailing now and taking $5 a share, sellers reason, is better than getting only pennies in bankruptcy. 

By Jon D. Markman <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/bios.asp#Markman>> 

In normal circumstances, shares of Houston energy-trading titan Enron (ENE <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?iPage=qd&Symbol=ENE>> , news <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?iPage=news&Symbol=ENE>> , msgs <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/community/message/board.asp?Symbol=ENE>> ) should have stabilized around $10 after it agreed to a merger with crosstown rival Dynegy (DYN <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?iPage=qd&Symbol=DYN>> , news <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?iPage=news&Symbol=DYN>> , msgs <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/community/message/board.asp?Symbol=DYN>> ) earlier this month. Instead, the stock price is retreating faster than the Taliban. Why?You invest.

We'll keep score.Money 2002 does it all. <<http://moneycentral.msn.com/redir/moneycentralredirect.asp?pageid=ed_block/money_planner&target=/articles/common/money2001pro.asp>> 

The answer, like everything associated with Enron, is complex. But the short version is that investors fear that hidden problems will scotch the merger and force Enron to seek bankruptcy protection, potentially leaving its shares worth pennies.

While attention has so far focused on credit problems related to ill-disclosed limited partnerships, institutional investors are increasingly worried about risks Enron faces in the market for financial derivatives known as ""swaps."" Accentuating their concern: Billions of dollars' worth of Enron's near-term swap contracts -- instruments that ironically were invented to help corporations limit risk -- will reportedly mature next month and are even more hidden from investors' view than the deals that have gotten the firm into trouble so far. On Wednesday afternoon, the bond-rating agency Fitch updated its opinion on Enron by stating it believed ""there have been significant cash collateral calls from wholesale trading customers well in excess of previous expectations."" 

Glenn Reynolds, chief executive of independent debt-research firm CreditSights and a former chief credit officer at Lehman Bros., said the swaps market is a very large but arcane investment arena that isn't followed by mainstream corporate bond analysts or equity analysts. Yet, he noted, ""it's one of the biggest things that can still go badly wrong for Enron.""

How much is Enron on the hook for?

Swaps exposure thus makes December a make-or-break month for the company, as its counterparties in complex deals glued together with billions in borrowed funds frantically attempt to unwind positions in markets as disparate as currency, natural gas, bonds and metals. If Enron either made the wrong bets on too many of these deals, or contract covenants are breached that spur demands for hard-asset or cash collateral, the company could be forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy court to prevent a run on its dwindling treasury.

Moreover, because the world of swaps and derivatives is so incestuous -- with Company A able to pay its hundreds of millions in derivatives obligations to Company B only after it receives payments from Company C - some traders worry that Enron's potential inability to pay off on its swaps liabilities could threaten the stability of the world's commodity-trading system. 

No one is saying that this worst-case scenario is bound to happen. But rumors of default risk can spread like financial smallpox in nervous markets -- even if they're never proved true. One story making the rounds on trading floors, for instance, tied the historic collapse of U.S. government bonds in the third week of November to the belief that Enron had to sell vast quantities of short-term Treasury notes to make good on swap-related margin calls. (Enron officials did not return calls for comment.)

Experts noted that Enron's counterparty risks and scant disclosure on high levels of borrowing remind them of the spectacular blowup of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, which imperiled the world capital markets until the Federal Reserve captained a bailout. That debacle ended when once-generous banks and brokerages finally turned off the money spigot. Said one veteran portfolio manager, who asked not to be identified: ""This is shaping up to be LTCM 2. If Enron's lines of credit dry up, they're out of business -- end of story.""

Lots of credit and lots of deals

To understand the problem more clearly it's important to understand what Enron does for a living, and the role and utility of swaps. 

Many investors think of Enron as an energy company or gas utility, but it has really operated more like a combination investment bank, market maker and hedge fund in the past few years. One of the key ways it earned income was its role in selling risk-management instruments -- those swaps -- as a solution for whatever financial impairments that a company fretted over. 

Let's say you run the risk-management operation of a metal-mining firm and you're long copper futures as a hedge against the possibility that prices might fall in six months. You want to lock in the price, so you enter into a swap with Enron under rules of the International Swap Dealers Agreement, or ISDA. Accounting protocols allow you to keep this trade off your balance sheet, so it's not disclosed anywhere for competitors, or investors, to monitor. One of Enron's roles was to find a company with the opposite problem to yours -- let's say they want to be short copper futures -- and make the match. Thus Enron helped you swap a risk that made you uncomfortable for a risk that you felt you could control. 

More often, Enron reportedly took the swap itself and laid off the risk by using some other hedge, such as being long or short Eurodollars or U.S. Treasury notes. It might also find it profitable to be the one responsible for actually delivering the physical product. At its peak, Enron is said to have been a counterparty on thousands of swaps per week.

This business requires massive amounts of credit -- also known as ""leverage"" -- because margins are slim; the only way to become super-successful is to do really big volume. It turned out that few of Long-Term Credit Management's counterparties or bank lenders understood that the hedge fund had leveraged itself by as much as 30:1 because of similar efforts to trade in high volume. And likewise, one veteran analyst who asked not to be identified told me that he believes Enron might have been leveraged by as much as an astronomical 100:1 in some cases.

Thomas Seims, chief economist at the Federal Reserve in Dallas and an authority on swaps, told me that the crux of the issue is, ""Do we know exactly what their positions are -- and did they use swaps and leverage properly or improperly? When we find out, we can determine the potential for a contagion effect."" 

The big question: How many deals?

Why don't we know what their positions are? Legally, they're not required to reveal them -- and we already know that Enron has done an absolutely terrible job of disclosing information that securities laws and investment community conventions actually require. Swaps are similar to the proprietary trading operation of major brokerages, but with one critical difference. Typically stocks are fairly liquid and transaction terms do not vary much. But swap contracts can have all sorts of covenants related to the creditworthiness of the counterparties. So for all anyone outside of Houston knows, there could be any number of billion-dollar deals hanging out there with rules that require Enron to put up collateral or pay off loans if their debt rating falls below a certain rating threshold, such as BBB-, one step above junk. The surprise disclosure of such a clause in a previously hidden limited partnership contract over a Brazilian deal is what caused Enron's stock to plunge 20% on Tuesday, according to traders. 

More importantly, one financial services executive pointed out, because Enron owns the market for many swaps, spread options and other thinly traded financial instruments, they're the ones who set the mark-to-market price that shows on their profit-and-loss statement. For example, every night an Enron trader must mark the value of a 15-year Chicago natural-gas swap on his books. There is no closing or settlement price -- there's only what the Enron trader thinks the price should be. It is in these mark-to-market prices of thousands of swap positions that Enron could theoretically hide hundreds of millions in unrealized losses, if it chose to. 

One prominent New York consultant to the energy risk-management industry told me he's estimated that Enron could be forced to write off as much $1 billion or more in failures related to its swap transactions. Why hasn't anyone focused on it? ""The magnitude of Enron's partnership problems is so great that after awhile you get numb, and no one is paying attention to this part of their operation.""

Philip K. Verleger Jr., a leading energy-industry economist and consultant, also noted that one reason that Enron risks aren't easily quantified is that they ""may not be price independent."" That's an economist's way of pointing out that the company -- a major player in a corner of the derivatives business called ""delta hedging"" -- may not have the capital required to maintain a futures position in all the puts or calls it sold to commodity producers trying to offset risks that the price of things like natural gas or oil might fall or rise sharply. If prices maintain above or below a level that Enron forecast as likely to make it money in such a transaction, no problem. But if prices in the commodity change unexpectedly -- as oil prices did earlier this month -- then Enron could find itself deep in the hole and forced to lean on thinning lines of credit to pay its obligation.

Whirlwind merger deal no reassurance

Verleger isn't mollified by the notion that Dynegy, which agreed to merge with Enron, has studied the company's trading book thoroughly and decided it was fine. ""Dynegy probably was not able to see its whole book in a week,"" he said. Added another trader, who declined to be identified: ""How anyone could do such fast due diligence is beyond me completely."" Another trader speculated that auditors at Dynegy -- a much smaller firm -- may have initially given Enron a free pass on some disclosures because it was considered one of the cleverest and best-connected companies in the nation, with a chief executive who was a major financial backer and friend of President George W. Bush.

Reynolds, the CreditSights executive, said that investors should beware what he calls ""omission risk"" -- or the simple fact that ""what you don't see is what gets you every time."" He points out, for instance, that Enron had a chance to tell investors about its ratings-related exposure in the Brazilian deal during a conference call with investors last week, but didn't. ""It boggles the mind"" that they have kicked away every opportunity to rebuild confidence and credibility, he said.

So what if gremlins pop out of the swaps closet? Reynolds believes that Dynegy will use broadly written escape clauses in its merger agreement to walk away from its Enron merger if unexpected swap defaults -- called ""fails"" in the business -- emerge. He believes that Enron would then find it necessary to seek the protection of bankruptcy court, because no other merger partner or bank is likely to follow in Dynegy's footsteps to the altar.

In that event, Reynolds estimates Enron's stock -- which traded for $85 a year ago -- could quickly sink to less than $2 from its current perch in the mid-single digits. Since holders of more than 80 bonds and senior bank loans would stand ahead of shareholders in bankruptcy proceedings, however, he speculated that Enron shareholders would be lucky to end up with pennies.

Dynegy Remains on a Roll as Earnings Soar 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Power marketer and trader Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) announced that its third-quarter earnings hit the upper end of Wall Street expectations as its backbone wholesale energy business delivered strong returns. The company said earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2000. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial / First Call had expected earnings in a range of 77 cents to 85 per share, with a mean expectation of 82 cents. 

Analysis: Dynegy has scored an impressive feat in beating its stellar financial performance over the course of 2000. Given the restrictions placed on power generators in California, general market upheaval and impact on the economy that has resulted from the events of Sept. 11, one might have expected Dynegy to see its earnings dip slightly compared to its 2000 performance. Quite to the contrary, Dynegy has emerged once again as a bright star in a rather bleak financial galaxy, demonstrating that its core focus on marketing and trading, along with a cautious approach into international markets and uncertain businesses such as telecom, is a winning strategy. Even in a weakened economy in which its own stock has fallen some 24 percent over the course of 2001, due in large part to market turmoil, Dynegy still stands out as a leader in the energy field, and almost single-handedly has kept energy stocks high on the radar screen of Wall Street. 

Dynegy's numbers command attention. In addition to its impressive 3Q report, during the first nine months of 2001 Dynegy has earned $571 million, or $1.69 a share, compared with $395 million, or $1.17, for the first nine months of 2000. Dynegy also has raised its earnings estimate for year-end 2001 to a range of $2.09 to $2.10 per diluted share from the $2.07 target set on Oct. 1. For 4Q and year 2002, Dynegy remains comfortable with its previously established target of 40 to 41 cents a share and $2.50 to $2.60 a share, respectively. The revised figures represent an increase of well over 30 percent for Dynegy's projections for 2000. Further, the company said that it remains confident that its projected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate over the next three years (through 2003) will average 20 percent to 25 percent. 

Without question, the vast majority of earnings increase at Dynegy is being derived from the company's Marketing and Trade unit, which Dynegy said accounted for more than 90 percent of the 3Q profits. In fact, out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the 3Q 2001 earnings, $263 million came from the marketing and trading division, representing an increase of 85 percent from 3Q 2000. Dynegy Marketing and Trade is engaged in a broad array of energy businesses, including the physical supply of and risk management activities around wholesale natural gas, power, coal, emission allowances, and weather derivatives. 

On the basis of the marketing and trade subsidiary, Dynegy is currently ranked as the fifth largest gas marketer in the country, and its ongoing success has resulted from a dual focus on natural-gas trading and power generation. For year-end 2000, Dynegy Marketing and Trade reported a 252-percent increase in recurring net income to $355 million, representing nearly 80 percent of Dynegy Inc.'s overall results. The segment's performance benefited from Dynegy's expanded North American natural-gas and power operations, including the integration of Illinova's unregulated generation assets, strong marketing, trading and risk management activities and a return to normal weather patterns. 

Clearly, this particular unit is the primary earnings driver for the entire company. In the third quarter, Dynegy Marketing and Trade's North American natural-gas volumes grew 12 percent to 11.0 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), an increase from 9.8 Bcf/d during 3Q 2000. Also under the same unit, total power sales increased 86 percent to 90.5 million MWh in 3Q 2001, compared to 48.7 million MWh in 3Q 2000. This 86-percent jump in total physical power sales led to an 85 percent year-over-year increase in recurring income for the marketing and trade division. According to Dynegy, the higher volumes in both gas and power were the result of improved market liquidity, greater market origination, increased sales volumes on Dynegydirect, and incremental gas marketing in Canada. 

Part of the expansion of this business will be an ongoing penetration of the European trading market. However, Dynegy maintains that, unlike its direct competitor Enron, its European expansion is methodical and cautious. Dynegy recently expanded its Dynegydirect trading portal into the United Kingdom, but its penetration of this market has been much slower than Enron, which, according to Dynegy, tried to expand into the European market ""in a hurry."" Another Dynegy rival is Reliant Energy, which also expanded into Europe in advance of other companies and is now reportedly considering a sale of its electricity generation business in the Netherlands. 

The comparison that Dynegy has made between itself and Enron may be intentional. Along with being long-time Houston-based rivals, Dynegy must find its current success even sweeter considering the turmoil that has taken place at Enron over the last year. Of course, Enron lost its CEO Jeffrey Skilling just over a month ago when he resigned amid the company's diminished stock value and huge losses in the telecom sector. Enron released its own 3Q earnings report on Oct. 16. Enron's core wholesale trading and marketing division met targets and drove up profits by 35 percent. The company's earnings also rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, in 3Q 2000. However, Enron posted a 3Q net loss as it faced $1.01 billion in charges, which included a $287 million write-down on its Azurix venture, $180 million from the restructuring of its broadband unit and $544 million in investment losses related to The New Power Company. What we know presently is that Enron's stock has dropped about 57 percent over the course of 2001, due to its troubled broadband sector, losses associated with its Dabhol subsidiary in India and overall downward market trends. 

If there is something that could be considered a blemish on Dynegy's current record, it may be its telecom business, known as Dynegy Global Communications, in which the company reported a $15 million loss for the third quarter. Dynegy Global Communications seeks to capitalize on the growing convergence between energy and communications sectors by building a broadband marketing and trading system. Dynegy has said that the loss is due to costs associated with developing its 16,000-mile bandwidth network, which reaches 44 U.S. cities and is expected to be completed in the four quarter. Unlike other power companies that are trying to exit the telecom sector (Reliant, for example), Dynegy still projects that it will find long-term success in this area, in part because it is taking a cautious approach toward expansion. Also, as another means of comparison with Enron, Dynegy's telecom business lost $15 million in the third quarter while Enron's broadband unit took a loss of $80 million. Another unit taking losses is Illinois Power, Dynegy's regulated transmission and distribution subsidiary, which reported a $15-million loss in 3Q 2001. Dynegy attributed this loss to a reduced industrial load. 

Perhaps the other area that may give pause to investors is Dynegy's engagements in the California market, which still remains unresolved. Dynegy is reportedly still owed about $320 to $325 million for power that was sold to the California utilities before the state government took over as the primary power purchaser. Despite Dynegy's best efforts to obtain the outstanding balance, and its confidence that it will ultimately be paid, the financially unstable condition of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison makes the timetable for any such payment quite uncertain. Also impacting Dynegy's California involvement are reports that California lawmakers want to renegotiate long-term agreements that the Department of Water Resources signed with various power suppliers, including Dynegy, earlier in the year. Wholesale prices have dropped considerably since the state of California signed the long-term contracts, and thus the state wants to renegotiate a better price for the power. Dynegy claims, however, that the contract it signed with the state contains legal protection for Dynegy's interests. 

Overall, however, Dynegy's 3Q financial report represents what is one of the few unqualified success stories in the energy industry. Stacked up against other companies that have struggled against the volatility of the nation's economy, Dynegy is clearly flourishing. Like other companies with heavy assets in generation, the fact that Dynegy's marketing and trading division is the primary profit driver for the company is not a revelation. What is perhaps more important is the diligent way in which Dynegy has methodically accumulated an arsenal of generation assets and expanded into new business lines with a very cautious approach.

Subject: Peaker Plant


Chuck,

When in Houston, I mentioned we had a site near Clinton, Iowa, that may be
optimum for a peaker electricity plant.  We aren't totally sure where the
Northern Border Pipeline crosses the Mississippi but its got to be
relatively close.  We know several pipelines are in the area.  The ones
currently feeding this site are too small to serve a peaker plant, but they
have to be coming from a larger source nearby.  The site is also adjacent to
major electricity lines.

I'd like to take you up on your offer to put us in touch with someone at
Enron, to whom we can discuss the location and determine if there is any
interest on Enron's part in the potential project.  Of course, we're
interested in being involved where our services are needed.

Let me know who to contact.

Phil

Subject:	Dynegy Request

David,

Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.

In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.

Let me know your thoughts on this.  

Michelle

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Japanese Accounting Changes
November 18, 2001 - Derivatives Week (Learning Curves)

There have been major changes to accounting standards in Japan which, by the
time they have all been implemented will have brought Japanese accounting
standards broadly into line with international norms. These changes are
comprehensive and include the introduction of fair value --or
mark-to-market--accounting. This last change, although seemingly innocuous
will be particularly powerful in its impact. 

But What Has All This To Do With Derivatives? 

The introduction of mark-to-market accounting requires listed Japanese
companies to record their holding of marketable property assets and
securities at current market value rather than at book value. This means
that balance sheets will no longer be buttressed by assets valued at
inflated bubble economy levels. But most crucially profit streams will
become exposed to movements in equity markets, as the definition of
securities includes the cross shareholdings which bind members of Japan's
Keiretsu and other business groupings. These are substantial in Japan,
accounting for perhaps 40% of all shareholdings. 

The unwinding of cross shareholdings is undoubtedly one of the factors
behind the recent weakness of Tokyo stock prices, not least as foreign
buyers who had been soaking up much of the unwound cross held shares coming
onto to the market have been notably absent over the past few months. 

Hence there has been much talk about how best to unwind these cross
shareholdings without further depressing the market. Where possible firms
with mutual shareholdings have been seeking arrangements that are
effectively straight swaps. But derivatives can also play their part. 

Many corporates with large shareholding disposal programmes have been
actively seeking to hedge their equity exposure as they embark on their
share sale process. Often they have effected this through the use of call
options. Thus if the market falls they have at least benefited from the
premium earned at the time of the sale of the call option and if the market
rises and the option is called by the purchaser then the shares have been
successfully disposed of, but without further dampening an already weak
market. 

Financial institutions have also been combining a similar strategy with
stock lending, thereby gaining both the option premium and a lending fee.
Certainly many market observers have been reporting an increase in such call
option trades over the past year or so. Moreover even for firms that do not
wish to sell down their equity portfolios, the increased profit volatility
which will result from having to revalue portfolios and book these changes
though the profit and loss account will significantly increase the
attractions of hedging. Allied to this and flowing from the realisation of
the full extent of the weakness of many Japanese financial institutions,
there has also been an increase in the use of credit derivatives which has
allowed investors to sell the risk of entering into a transaction with a
Japanese bank. This market has been cyclical, rising and falling with the
changes in perceptions of the true financial state of the country's banking
sector. However the underlying demand is there. 

The Flip Side 

In the same way that Japanese banks and corporates must book the true value
of their equity portfolios they must also report the true market value of
their derivatives positions. And there is concern that this will only serve
further to expose the weakness of the banks in particular. So it has been
reported that the Japanese Bankers' Association (zenginkyo) has been
lobbying the accounting standards making body, the Japan Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, for a further delay in the introduction of the
mark to market requirement for derivatives. This is in addition to the
one-year delay already secured. The original delay was portrayed as in
response to difficulties arising out of the consolidation of the Japanese
banks around three or four major groupings, but most market observers
suspect that this was only a smokescreen to cover up for the ineffective
hedging strategies of the major banks, most notably macro hedging. Now the
bankers' representative body is suggesting the deadline be extended further,
perhaps indefinitely. 

This may get the banks at least part way out of the short-term crunch they
are under from greater disclosure requirements, but with the Japanese
economy continuing to deteriorate, with serious consequences for the size of
the non-performing loans problem, the Japanese financial system will have to
face the music sometime. 


ISDA addresses successor/convertible issues
IFR - November 17, 2001

Standard documentation aimed at clarifying which company should serve as
reference entity for credit default swaps in the event of a demerger or
other structural change, such as a consolidation, will be put forward by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association this week.

While the successor issue has been debated since the break-up of National
Power of the UK, the imminent break-ups of AT&T and BT into smaller entities
has underscored the need for improved documentation. 

Ambiguity arose out of the 1999 ISDA credit derivative definitions because
they defined the successor as the entity that assumes ""all or substantially
all"" of the original company's relevant obligations. AT&T's demerger plans,
for example, create no clear successor under ISDA's 1999 definitions.

To eliminate the uncertainty for those that bought or sold protection on
companies that do not produce a clear successor, ISDA's supplement on
successor issues uses a tiered set of numerical standards, said Kimberley
Summe, general counsel of ISDA.

Chip Goodrich, managing director in the legal department at Deutsche Bank
and chairman of ISDA's documentation committee, said that he did not expect
extensive comments on the new documentation, as possible resolutions to the
issue had been thoroughly debated by market participants.

Under the standard, a new entity that receives 75~/~ of the original
company's bonds and loans after a demerger would be deemed the reference
obligation for a credit default swap. If the 75% test is not applicable,
then a 25% test applies. If more than 25% of the underlying's obligations
are held by a new reference entity then the credit derivative transaction
must be broken up into several separate transactions of equal weight, said
Goodrich, who also sits on ISDA's credit derivatives market practice group.

In the event that no successor company assumes 250/o of the original
company's obligations, another set of rules come into play. The entity that
receives the highest percentage of the original company's loans and bonds
becomes the sole successor.

Should the debt be evenly split between two entities in this category, -the
one that assumes the highest percentage of obligations (loans, debt and
other borrowed money) is deemed the successor. No successor will be
appointed if the original reference entity continues to exist.

In a separate development, ISDA published a supplement to the ISDA 1999
credit definitions that specifies ""not contingent"" as one of the delivery
obligation characteristics. This clarifies that convertible exchangeable or
accreting bonds qualify to be delivered, said Goodrich. ""It's a
clarification of what was implicit in the definition in the past,"" he added.

This has become an issue because of the surge of activity in hedging of
convertible bonds this year and the debate last month over whether
Railtrack's convertible bond was deliverable under existing swap contracts.
Most of the major dealers made an immediate move to use of the new ISDA
language by adopting it as standard in default swap contracts last week.


New York dealers go it alone on default swap clause
IFR - November 17, 2001
By John Macaskill

Abandonment of the obligation acceleration clause is unlikely to cause a
rift within the credit derivatives trading community as serious as the one
that developed over the restructuring clause earlier this year. All the
same, last week's unilateral move by the main New York dealers took European
traders and default swap end users by surprise.

It came almost exactly a year after a similar decision by the most active
New York dealers to drop restructuring as a standard credit event for US
corporate default swaps. That move threatened a schism within the credit
derivatives market, and a reduction in overall liquidity because of
different trade practices being followed in different regimes.

Damage to liquidity
The threat was headed off by traders and users of credit derivatives from
both Europe and the US, who worked on committees co-ordinated by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) to agree a modified
definition of the restructuring clause as a credit event. The new definition
was agreed at the end of April and released in May, but liquidity in the
default swap market was hit in the early months of the year by the
uncertainty caused by the debate.

The issue of obligation acceleration had not been a great concern for
dealers until Moody's indicated that it was uncomfortable with the inclusion
of what it viewed as a ""soft"" credit event in the default swaps that back
credit-linked notes and collateralised debt obligations.

Obligation acceleration and obligation default are two clauses that can
trigger default swap exercises under the standard 1999 ISDA credit
derivatives definitions. Dealers have been aware that the payment of an
obligation might be accelerated owing to the breach of a covenant on a bond
or loan. This might trigger exercise on a default swap, when there was still
a chance that the covenant could be made whole
before the fundamental default event - failure to make a debt payment - had
taken place.

Most dealers decided that this was not a major issue, however, mainly
because there do not appear to have been any examples of obligation
acceleration triggering a default swap, and because covenant breaching will
almost certainly come at the same time as failure to pay on a liability.

However, Moody's turned the debate into an economic issue for dealers by
objecting to incorporation of the clause in the swaps used to back synthetic
collateralised debt obligations.

Dealers have been making enormous profits from synthetic securitisation this
year. Three of the top credit derivatives trading houses have each sold over
US$10bn of swap-backed issuance this year, and a string of dealers have sold
between US$2bn and US$10bn. This is high margin business, with fees of over
100bp for a deal often seen.

Profit drag
Moody's applies a 25% increase to the default probability used for the COO's
it rates if they are backed by swaps featuring the obligation acceleration
clause. Banks can cut this charge by incorporating language that specifies a
timeframe for covenant breaches to be cured. None the less, the clause can
still be a significant drag on their CDO income.

It is also an economic issue for Moody's, because swaps without the
obligation acceleration clause match more closely the criteria of its
historical default database - one of its major assets. ""It was never clear
to us how obligation acceleration as a credit event had any meaning in these
transactions,"" said Noel Kirnon, managing director responsible for
collateralised debt obligations and derivatives at Moody's. He welcomed last
week's move to drop the clause as a standard feature of default swaps traded
in the US.

Derivatives dealing heads in New York echo this sentiment and point out that
buyers of credit protection will still be able to request that obligation
acceleration is included as a feature in a swap. In the first few days of
trading without standard inclusion of the clause last week, there was no
evidence of a price basis opening up between contracts with the clause and
those without, indicating that it is not yet being viewed as an economic
factor by buyers of protection.

""It is basically a redundant credit event,"" said the US head of credit
derivatives at one bank. ""For protection buyers it does not particularly
weaken the power of the contract,"" he added.

European objections
There were some objectors to the move among dealers active in the US market,
as UBS and Commerzbank declined to drop the clause for standard contracts.
The other big dealers moved in step, however. These include Citigroup, CSFB,
Deutsche Bank, Goldman, JP Morgan Chase, Lehman and Merrill.

Some dealers would also like to change use of the repudiation/moratorium
clause in default swaps to make it clear that it cannot be used to apply to
a corporate credit, but no change in market practice is expected.  The
essential credit derivative settlement debates in recent months - over
successor entity and convertible deliverability - have been resolved on a
global basis.

There is no indication that European traders and end users of default swaps
will fall into line with the contract shift made in the US last week,
however.  ""The New York dealers' decision was surprising, but it wasn't the
first time they have moved unilaterally,"" said one European trader. ""Europe
will stick with obligation acceleration and the repudiation/moratorium,"" he
predicted.


What Enron Did Right
The Wall Street Journal - November 19, 2001
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of
age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition
(Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb
bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is
risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has
resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.

Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became
a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of
conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip
with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a
mirage.

We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.
We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is
needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical
norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh
revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that
have enduring value.

Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric power
industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of bidding by
customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. Enron was
the leader in pioneering this business. 

Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is
spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been
consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.

Innovation and the ""deintegration"" of power contracts. Under the old
regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a
one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible
and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure
by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the
exact needs of the customer. 

To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent
parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered
customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did
too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors.
Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called
the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not
necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem
today.

Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logic of
deintegration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for
instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what
amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate
activities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that
integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming
from bureaucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers.""
Enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated
chain on the bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of
the internal operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the
terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is
very healthy for the economy. 

Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment,
natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated
pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a
number of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of
competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing
strategies. Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so
that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source
at any moment in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert
molecules to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry,
created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers. 

Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easily
have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading
risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron
pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the
best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron
made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential
to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and
ability to deliver. 

The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by
the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to
finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading
portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look
to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather
than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.

A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporate
culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a
utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of
excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15
years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient,
lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by
giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create
markets, and transfer within the firm. 

Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an
open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and
culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role
of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a
lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model
for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.

Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation
of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the
business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area
in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.

The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find
a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should
hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent
themselves and remake their industries.


FpML group joins ISDA
IFR - November 17, 2001

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association last week announced
plans to incorporate FpML.org, a non-profit industry body dedicated to
developing a business information exchange standard for electronic dealing
and processing of financial derivative transactions.

""FpML.org's funding is stable. But the founding members recognise that [the
standard] is broadly beneficial to the industry and that working with ISDA
is the best way to continue developing it,"" said Brian Lynn, vice-president
of etrading at JP Morgan Chase in New York.

""This is an exciting and important step toward derivatives technology
development that is consistent with other ISDA efforts to provide an
effective structure for derivatives documentation and trading,"" said Robert
Pickel, executive director and chief executive of ISDA. ""We have common
membership and have been talking to each other for a while,"" he added,
noting that FpML.org's language uses ISDA documentation and terms as its
foundation.

Financial product Mark-up Language's (FpML) chief virtue is that it
addresses straight-through processing. It offers a basis for achieving
straight-through processing of trades, back office systems and settlement
systems. Greater automation reduces the time it takes to close a deal and
the rate of error.  In 1999, the industry spent roughly US$1bn processing
OTC derivatives transactions, and at some firms about 20%-30% of that figure
represented documentation errors, said JP Morgan's Lynn.

The manual confirmation matching processes required today is not included in
the 20%-30% figure, he added. In theory, liquidity should also receive a
boost from a move to greater automation. ""For smaller end users it means
that there is less work involved in entering into a transaction,"" said Lynn.

No decision on linking FpML's transaction standards with ISDA master and
netting agreements has been made yet, but such a move is likely in the
future. ISDA initiatives aimed at providing members with extensible mark-up
language (XML) resources for netting and negotiating, storing and archiving
ISDA master agreements seem to point in this direction, as FpML is an XML
solution. ISDA's interactive web and CD-ROM based documentation library is
in an XML format currently.

""The integration of FpML into ISDA will mean speeding up the development of
the standard and expansion of its coverage consistent with our original
mission. The goals of FpML.org and ISDA are similar as both have worked
towards technological advancement in standard setting,"" said Philippe
Khuong-Huu, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, and chairman of FpML.org's
board of directors.

Joining forces with ISDA will also help raise the profile of FpML, but
awareness of its potential is not a problem said Lynn. ""The issue is
deploying systems that use the standard.""

Two multi-dealer trading systems for interest rate derivatives that are
being tested now, Reuters' Dealing for Swaps and SwapsWire, plan to go live
using FpML. FpML use at individual banks is done on a proprietary basis for
now. No banks yet operate on XML on a company-wide basis.

FpML.org's architectural working group, and its working groups covering
interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives, will continue to
exist as sub-groups of ISDA's new FpML committee. ISDA's FpML committee will
retain responsibility for approving new versions of the standard.

""Vendors will continue to be represented on the standards committee and on
working groups,"" said Lynn.
FpML standards currently exist for interest rate derivative products and
forward rate agreements. Foreign exchange and equity derivatives standards
arc nearing completion.

"Weekly Update","Mark,
Nothing particularly new to report this week on Cuiaba.  GT12 should be commissioned on gas in early November and GT11 repaired and finally commissioned by year end.  Still only verbal commitments from the insurer, but coverage looks good.  We may have some issues on recovery of legal costs.   No more news from Furnas, but the team continues to work with the Brazilian gov't to get these issues resolved.  Pete does not want to send Notice of Dispute letters to Furnas at this time.  We continue to prepare for the Shell mediation in Toronto set for November 5-7. 

On Elektro, the tariff pass through suits are finalized and will be filed today.  The suit to protect our assets prior to the Annex V set off will be filed this week.  We hope to have the information from ASMAE to conduct our calculations around Oct. 24th.  If there are any delays,  we will file an injunction compelling the information.

Regards,
      Michelle

Our board meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, November 13, in New York. It is
our annual budget meeting so it is an important meeting. I am aware,
however, that some firms have instituted temporary bans or limitations on
travel. It would be helpful to know for planning purposes whether you will
be able to make it to New York for the meeting. George James is hosting the

I think we should issue a statement regarding the deliverability of the
Railtrack convertible bonds.  First, I do not think that plain vanilla
converts are ""contingent.""  and therefore should be deliverable.    Second,
I think we need to have clarity and certainty here so that this issue does
not become another cloud over the credit derivatives market.   The
statement should simply be ISDA's view as to the meaning and intent of its
own document.    We should probably wait until we have had the opportunity
to see a draft of the opinion to be issued by Robin Potts (QC?) just to
make sure that the statement and his opinion are in agreement.




RPICKEL@isda.org on 10/15/2001 12:06:35 AM



To:   BOARD@isda.org
cc:   KSumme@isda.org, LMarshall@isda.org
Subject:  Credit Derivatives Issue


You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in
the
credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in the
UK.
ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement
regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others are
either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not issue
a statement.

Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible
bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. What
is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of ""Not
Contingent"" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typically
required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that the
payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at the
option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of
the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercise
the conversion (sometimes referred to as a ""widows and orphans"" clause) is
a
standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion
right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so.
In
the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trustee
to convert exists.

A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, the
User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in the
next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the
""group of six"" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, we
suggest that ""plain vanilla"" convertible bonds should satisfy the ""Not
Contingent"" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. ""Plain
vanilla"" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion
is at the option of the holder of the trustee.

A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) is
scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything prior
to that meeting.

I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement
regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their views
on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are also
discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how
we
might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share your
views with the other addressees of this email, as they are coordinating the
views of members.

AGENDA
DAY 1:  Tuesday, October 16, 2001
8:30 a.m. WELCOME: WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS?
8:40 a.m. POWER MARKETING, RISK MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY - Dave Freeman, Senior Director, Aquila
Power marketing is largely the business of price risk management for the energy industry. Energy policy at the state and Federal level can act to facilitate, or cripple the ability of the market to respond to and mitigate threats to price stability.
9:20 a.m. THE SUPPLY RESPONSE: ADDING NEW GENERATING CAPACITY - Lynn H. Church, President, Electric Power Supply Association
The ability to add new generating capacity in a timely fashion is key to avoiding future energy crises. Balancing environmental concerns, NIMBY and public accountability with the need for additional generating capacity.

10:00 a.m. THE NUCLEAR RESURGENCE - Joe F. Colvin, President and CEO, Nuclear Energy Institute 

After coal, nuclear power remains the most important source of electricity in the US, and with license renewals, and proposed facility expansions, is likely to hold that position for some time to come. Nuclear power economics and opportunities in today's competitive markets. 

10:45 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. Break  Visit Exhibits 

KEYNOTE ADDRESS 
11:15 a.m ENERGY AND TELECOM CONVERGENCE 
J. Bennett Johnson Former US Senator and Chairman of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Chairman, Advisory Board, Ambient Corp. 

11:45-12:30 A panel of industry experts will address the issues and opportunities in power and telecom convergence: theuse of existing fiber, rights of way, broadband trading and commoditization and powerline telecom technology. 

12:30 to 2:00 p.m. luncheon  

Concurrent Sessions  

WHOLESALE

2:00 p.m. BUILDING COAL-FIRED POWERPLANTS-- Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone 

The US isn't the Saudi Arabia of coal-- it's the whole OPEC of coal. Most power generated in the US is coal-fired, and is likely to remain so. It is not the fuel of the past, it is the fuel of the present and future, with more coal-fired plants planned now than any time in decades. The economics and political realities of coal plant construction. 

2:45 p.m. NATURAL GAS AND POWER - Mike Reed, VP Market & Quantitative Analysis PG&E National Energy Group  

Gas is the dominant fuel for new powerplants, and the dominant source of growth for gas markets, but the markets aren't joined at the hip. How gas and power interrelate, and the public policy implications of market power in both/either markets. 

RETAIL

2:00 p.m. RETAIL MARKETS OVERVIEW Kathleen Magruder, Vice President, Law and Government Affairs, The New Power Company  

What works, and what doesn't, in retail markets. A market-by-market overview of the key opportunities in electric deregulation today. 

2:45 p.m. TEXAS MARKETS   Stephanie Kroger, Partner, Mayor, Day, Caldwell and Keeton  

With the pilots launched and full access in two months, all eyes are on Texas retail markets-- the biggest retail markets in America. How these markets work, how to take advantage of the opportunities they present. 

3:30-4:15 P.M . Break Visit Exhibits 

Concurrent Sessions  

WHOLESALE

4:15 p.m. PRIVATIZING TRANSMISSION-- John Howe, Former Chairman of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, Vice President, Electric Industry Affairs, American Superconductor  

New transmission technologies and the massive growth in electric demand are creating opportunities for investment in transmission. What are the opportunities? How does regulatory policy impact the siting of transmission facilities and their operation? 

5:00 p.m. ISOs, RTO's TRANSCOS & STATUS QUOsDariush Shirmohammadi, PA Consulting. 

How are the various structures of transmission organizations working? What are the prospects for progress in creating super-regional, independent transmission organizations? 

RETAIL

4:15 p.m. CALIFORNIA UPDATE Randy Abernathy, Vice President, Marketing Services, California ISO 

Beyond the hype and headlines-- what's being done to maintain and guarantee continued reliable service in California. 

5:00 p.m. CONSERVATION AND LOAD MANAGEMENT IN URGENT SITUATIONS- Don Fuller, Director, Client Relations, California ISO 

California has recently become a testing ground for mechanisms to manage the demand-side of the supply-demand equation, with dramatically effective results. What went right. 

6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.  Power Marketing Association Reception in Exhibit Hall DAY 2:  Wednesday, October 17, 2001
8:30 a.m. CREDIT RISK AND ITS MANAGEMENT - (Special early morning session) Scott Ettien, Vice President and Tim Moore, Senior Underwriter, NCM Americas.
Price differentials aren't always about time and location-- sometimes they are about the likelihood of being paid. Utilities have traditionally finessed credit requirements by spreading uncollectables among their customer base, and until recently, this was enough to make the utilities themselves bulletproof credit risks. No more. Using credit insurance and internal controls to manage the final frontier in risk management.
KEYNOTE ADDRESS


9:15 a.m. - THE NEW U.S. ENERGY POLICY 
William L. Massey, Commissioner 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 

The senior commissioner at the FERC is seeing many of his views on transmission become the majority position in the new administration. 

10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. - Break -Visit Exhibits 

10:30 a.m. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION - Buck Buckner, Director of Marketing, Stewart & Stevenson 

Power shortages have caused revisitation of the issues associated with distributed generation-- interconnection policy, limits on operations, gas tariffs, siting review, net metering and a plethora of lesser issues. With these changes, the potential for distributed generation has grown significantly. 

11:10 a.m. COMMODITY EXCHANGES: REGULATED AND UNREGULATED- Brad Leach, Senior Director, NYMEX 

As power markets continue to mature, commodity exchanges are slowly beginning to develop, with varying characteristics of liquidity, neutrality and regulatory status. Where exchanges stand today, and where they are heading in the future. 

11:50 a.m. CAREER TRENDS - Marc Granet, President, IDC Executive Search, Inc. 

What jobs will last? What skills become more valuable? How do I build my career in the evolving energy industry? 

12:30 p.m. CONFERENCE ADJOURNS

 I wanted to drop you an email to get more information on Greg's talk at your conference on 10/12.  I believe he's going to address your group on business updates.  Are there particulars you wish for him to cover?  How long is he speaking and at what time?  Do you wants slides?  Will there be a Q&A and if yes, any thoughts on what people will be asking?

"Legal Offsite","After last night's US and Great Britain retaliation against Taliban and Bin Laden forces, I am extremely concerned about travelling to Houston at this point in time.

Houston is not only George W's hometown are but it is also one of the US cities with a very large community of muslims.  Hope not, but it could certainly be one of the next targets for terrorists attacks.

Unfortunately, I've already suffered NYC immigration problems in the 90's during the Gulf War and would rather not face it again.  You have no idea what is like to be questioned by immigration officers, take your clothes off in a small office, and have your luggage carefully searched.  Syrian name, Italian passport, Brazilian residence ...  To me, today's situation is a lot more complicated than the Gulf War.

Thank you in advance for understanding my personal decision of not travelling to Houston for the seminar.

Regards,

Sami

I spoke with Mark Haedicke today regarding the recent developments in Afganistan.  He advised that there is no Enron prohibition or advisory regarding travel to Houston for the off-site for our group, but he is leaving the decision up to each individual, based on comfort level and personal considerations.

I have decided to travel, but wanted to advise you of my conversation with Mark.

That is a great article in this month's Corporate Legal Times on the Enron legal department.  I know that the wholesale group has been critical to the company, and your role has been critical to the success of the legal department. 

Thanks for looking to Milbank on PG&E and EBS this year, among other things. 

In order to review where we are, and what we ought to be doing to better service your group, I would like to arrange a meeting with you at your convenience.  To suggest dates: do any of 10/19. 10/26, 11/2 or 11/8 work for lunch or an afternoon meeting?

Hope to hear from you soon.

Jim - 
 
It has been several years since  we've visited, and there are a couple of areas I'd like to update with you  on.  I'm hopeful, after reading the following, that you will feel it  is worthwhile for us to get together again.
 
First, my last litigation project at  Fulbright & Jaworski just came to a close very unexpectedly, due  to a third party stay order, and I am once again looking for new matters to work  on.  I have attached my updated resume for your reference, or to pass on to  others in your Law Department who might have needs for my type of skills on a  project basis.  At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I've mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats.
 
Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a ""Legal Information Counsel"" position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.   
 
I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.  
 
I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.  
 
I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.
 
Steve

Dear Mr Mark Haedicke: 

  

            Lions. tigers and bears and another conference . . . oh no!  WAIT - don't be like me and just put this one with all the other junk e-mail you receive and we know where that goes.  Take a look and see what's in store for us this year at CBI's 3rd Annual Financing US Projects Conference.  Believe me, I know what you are thinking.  Several conference brochures come across my desk every day and admittedly I have seen and heard too many of the same people speak about the same thing.  CBI, however, always seems to be able to bring something new and interesting each time they organize this conference.  Last year was a great success.  If you didn't make it last year, come see what you have been missing.  If you did, come back and hear and explore some of the latest developments in financing power projects. 

Before assembling their agenda, the Center for Business Intelligence makes a concerted effort to speak with professionals in our industry to ensure that the most popular topics and issues are addressed so that people like you and me can do our business better.  This year, CBI has assembled an excellent round of speakers who are experts in their fields and who will provide you with a first hand view of their experiences.

            Besides being an excellent networking opportunity, CBI's 3rd Annual Financing US Projects is assured to provide you with an opportunity to get an update on many interesting areas of financing power projects from both a debt and equity perspective. Join your colleagues at an event, which could once again be one of the most informative conferences of the year. 

            In a market like today, one cannot miss a conference like this!  This year's conference takes place in New York City on November 15-16, 2001.  What better way to round out the year and support a city struck by tragedy to emerge and lead our us all into a political and economic victory.  I hope you can join me and all of your other colleagues, bankers and consultants so that we can all share our views and experiences in a market, which appears to have no boundaries for creativity.  For more information or to register, call CBI toll free at 800-817-8601 (781-939-2438 outside the U.S.), e-mail cbireg@cbinet.com <mailto:cbireg@cbinet.com>, or visit <http://www.cbinet.com/>.

Our board meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, November 13, in New York. It is
our annual budget meeting so it is an important meeting. I am aware,
however, that some firms have instituted temporary bans or limitations on
travel. It would be helpful to know for planning purposes whether you will
be able to make it to New York for the meeting. George James is hosting the
meeting here at the Morgan Stanley offices.

"FW: SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","
Mark,

in the light of this, I am feeling uncomfortable about asking my staff to fly to Houston for the conference. Several of them have already spoken to me about this and expressed their nervousness. 

Can we talk about this this pm on our call. 

Thanks

To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Enron Exits Portland General (Again) 



By Jon T. Brock
Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence 


  <https://www.secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/j_brock_photo.jpg>

[News item from PR Newswire] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Northwest Natural Gas Company (NYSE: NWN) for the sale of Enron's wholly owned electric utility subsidiary, Portland General Electric. The proposed transaction, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2002. 

Analysis: Enron is attempting to sell Portland General again, this time to Northwest Natural Gas Company (NW Natural). Enron attempted to sell Portland General to Sierra Pacific in November of 1999. However, that sale did not complete apparently due to a delay in Nevada deregulation. Let's take a step back and look at the history of Enron's dance with Portland General. 

Enron originally confirmed that its ""merger"" with Portland General had closed effective July 1, 1997, approximately one year after it was announced. The $3-billion combination created an enterprise with a market value of approximately $12 billion. Enron issued 50.5 million new common shares to shareholders of Portland General, consolidated Portland General's debt of $1.1 billion and accounted for the transaction on a purchase accounting basis. 

The acquisition linked Enron and Portland General, a successful, low-cost electric utility operating in the fast-growing Pacific Northwest region. With ownership of approximately 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity and more than 38,000 miles of natural-gas pipeline worldwide in 1997, the combined company aimed to provide integrated energy solutions for wholesale and retail natural gas and electricity customers in North America and internationally. At least that was the plan. 

Enron also did an acquisition of a telecommunications firm based in Portland, Ore. that had links to Portland General. On Nov. 17, 1997, Enron announced the acquisition of OPTEC Inc., a Portland, Ore.-based provider of data communications integration and services. The acquisition was handled through FirstPoint, Enron's telecommunications unit at the time. It was originally part of Portland General. FirstPoint had announced in September 1997 an agreement with the Williams Communications Group unit of The Williams Cos. (Williams) and Montana Power's Touch America, to build a fiber optic network from Portland to Los Angeles. 

For those of us covering the energy industry, you will recall that 1997 was a period of energy ""convergence."" Utilities were expanding into telecommunications at a head-spinning rate and oil and gas companies were busy doing ""strategic acquisitions."" 

Williams had agreed to acquire Mapco Inc. for about $2.46 billion in stock and the assumption of about $1 billion in Mapco debt in November 1997. Also announced in the same month was Sonat Inc., known for its pipelines, agreeing to acquire closely held exploration and production concern Zilkha Energy Co. for $1.04 billion in stock. In June 1997, NGC Corp. announced that it had closed an acquisition of Destec Energy, Inc., a leading independent power producer, and had closed on the related sale of most of Destec's international projects and operations to AES Corp. for $407 million, subject to certain adjustments. The net cost of the assets to be retained by NGC, originally expected to be approximately $400 million, had been estimated to be in the range of $300 to $325 million, after the sale of certain non-strategic assets. Also occurring in June of 1997 was Duke Power Co. and Houston-based PanEnergy Corp. linking up in a ""merger"" that took approximately seven months to complete. Under terms of the agreement, shares of PanEnergy stock would be converted to 1.0444 shares of Duke Energy stock. Duke Energy would adopt Duke Power's present common stock dividend payment of $2.12 per share. 

So Enron was not alone in the ""merger-mania"" field of energy companies expanding their balance sheet with strategic assets. Two years later however, Enron decided to exit Portland General. Enron had decided to sell Portland General to Sierra Pacific. With the announced sale, Kenneth Lay, Enron Corp. chairman and CEO said, ""The rapidly evolving competitive electricity market allows us to deliver commodity services and risk management products to our customers without requiring the ownership of a regulated electric utility."" Jeff Skilling, then Enron's president and COO, also chimed in by saying, ""In general, we would say that Portland General is not as strategic as it was before-when it had a strong wholesale business that we could integrate with our nationwide wholesale business."" 

In the two years following the $3-billion purchase of Portland General, Enron found operating a strictly regulated electric utility to be frustrating. Oregon regulators approved the acquisition only after Enron agreed to cut power rates by $141 million, more than double what the company had proposed. Oregon regulators also rejected plans to sell Portland General's 14 power plants-playing havoc with Enron's asset management strategy. 

Nevada-based Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to buy Portland General in November 1999. It was to pay $2.1 billion, including $2.02 billion in cash. It also was to assume about $1 billion in debt and preferred stock. The deal was officially called off in April of this year although it had been considered dead months before. Sierra Pacific planned to sell some of its Nevada assets to raise cash for the deal, but Nevada's move to electricity deregulation was delayed, and Sierra couldn't carry out the sales. 

Enron begins to look for another buyer and has found Northwest Natural Gas Company. According to Enron, under terms of the agreement, Northwest will purchase Portland General from Enron for $1.875 billion. This is comprised of $1.55 billion in cash, $200 million in Northwest preferred stock, $50 million in Northwest common stock, and the assumption of Enron's $75-million balance on its customer benefits obligation, which was stipulated in its 1996 agreement to purchase Portland General. In addition to the purchase price, Northwest will assume approximately $1.1 billion in Portland General debt and preferred stock. 

According to Moody's this morning, Northwest plans to form a holding company (HoldCo) that will become the parent of Northwest Natural and Portland General. HoldCo plans to finance this transaction with a combination of about $1.5 billion of bank borrowings, about $250 million of common stock and FELINE PRIDES (a mandatory convertible hybrid security) to be sold to Enron, and about $150 million of common stock to be sold to the public. Consummation of this transaction is contingent upon numerous regulatory approvals, which are expected to take from nine to twelve months. 

Northwest principally is engaged in the distribution of natural gas. The Oregon Public Utility Commission has allocated to Northwest, as its exclusive service area, a major portion of western Oregon, including the Portland metropolitan area, most of the Willamette Valley and the coastal area from Astoria to Coos Bay. Northwest also holds certificates from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission granting it exclusive rights to serve portions of three Washington counties bordering the Columbia River. Gas service is provided in 96 cities, together with neighboring communities, in 17 Oregon counties, and in nine cities, together with neighboring communities, in three Washington counties. They serve more than 525,000 customers in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington. Portland General currently serves 730,000 customers and owns 2,015 megawatts of electric generation, split evenly between hydro, coal and natural gas. 

So is energy convergence over? Absolutely not! Northwest is obviously moving into power with this purchase of Portland General from Enron. And it is a good move for them. They are obviously the local favorite, have an established network in the states of Oregon and Washington, and already have commodity delivery experience in the natural-gas arena. As far as I can tell, there are no ""strings attached"" to deregulation of Oregon in order for this deal to go through like in the Sierra Pacific deal. Let's see if Enron can finally sell its regulated electric utility asset. It's been trying since 1999.

"Last Week to Receive Early Bird Discount for Distribution Companies Conference","Performance Management for Electric Distribution Companies

An Executive Forum

October 25-26, 2001, Atlanta, GA

 


OVERVIEW


 

Deregulation is introducing competition into the electric utility industry in an ever-increasing rate, and it is requiring companies to consider dramatic changes in their business processes, in the operation of their businesses, and in managing their assets.  Issues such as customer satisfaction, performance based rates, operational reliability targets, operational efficiencies, risk management, and rate reductions are among the new business drivers.

 

With the advent of new choices open to the smallest retail customers as well as the largest industrials, distribution companies are re-engineering their businesses and re-establishing their corporate priorities in response to these new challenges.  This new business environment has brought performance management to the forefront for the electric distribution companies, and they are being driven by regulators, customers, and financial rating agencies to improve all aspects of their performance.  

 

Through this conference, we have gathered leading executives from distribution companies, wires companies, generation companies, energy marketers, regulators, and market participants to openly discuss the issues, their experiences, and their corporate strategies.  Our objective for this executive forum is to provide you with new insights into how electric distribution companies are addressing these issues and concerns, and to help you formulate your own corporate approach to this challenging and complex new world. 

 

The website link for the conference is provided below. Please click the link to see the program agenda, general information including location and hotel, and online registration. You can also register by calling us at 303-770-8800.

Ancillary Services Conference

October 31-November 2, 2001, Denver, CO

 


OVERVIEW


 

The Ancillary Services conference will explore the rapidly changing and fascinating engineering, economic, market, and policy issues related to bulk-power ancillary services. These issues are difficult to resolve because these services are essential for both reliability and commerce, and it is often difficult to disentangle the two.

 

Topics to be covered at this event include centralized vs. supplier unit commitment, integration of ancillary-service markets with energy and congestion markets, relationships among forward and real-time markets, measuring the performance of ancillary-service delivery, operating costs to provide these services, retail-load provision of some ancillary services, comparisons among the existing ISOs and future RTOs in their treatment of ancillary services, and the feasibility of letting price influence the amount of reserves acquired.

 

Electric Utility Consultants, Inc., a long-time provider of timely conferences and workshops for the electric industry, has assembled a covey of top experts to explore all aspects of the emerging field in a conference devoted exclusively to Ancillary Services.

"Re: Credit Derivatives Issue","
I think we should issue a statement regarding the deliverability of the
Railtrack convertible bonds.  First, I do not think that plain vanilla
converts are ""contingent.""  and therefore should be deliverable.    Second,
I think we need to have clarity and certainty here so that this issue does
not become another cloud over the credit derivatives market.   The
statement should simply be ISDA's view as to the meaning and intent of its
own document.    We should probably wait until we have had the opportunity
to see a draft of the opinion to be issued by Robin Potts (QC?) just to
make sure that the statement and his opinion are in agreement.




RPICKEL@isda.org on 10/15/2001 12:06:35 AM

Subject:  Credit Derivatives Issue


You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in
the
credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in the
UK.
ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement
regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others are
either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not issue
a statement.

Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible
bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. What
is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of ""Not
Contingent"" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typically
required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that the
payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at the
option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of
the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercise
the conversion (sometimes referred to as a ""widows and orphans"" clause) is
a
standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion
right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so.
In
the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trustee
to convert exists.

A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, the
User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in the
next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the
""group of six"" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, we
suggest that ""plain vanilla"" convertible bonds should satisfy the ""Not
Contingent"" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. ""Plain
vanilla"" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion
is at the option of the holder of the trustee.

A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) is
scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything prior
to that meeting.

I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement
regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their views
on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are also
discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how
we
might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share your
views with the other addressees of this email, as they are coordinating the
views of members.

Bob

FERC Chairman Wood Ups the Ante on RTO Formations,
Outlines Long-Term Objectives for Industry 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] The chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said that all U.S. utilities must submit plans to the agency by Dec. 15 for joining regional transmission organizations (RTOs) or the firms and their affiliates would no longer be able to sell electricity in the wholesale market at market-based rates. Merger approvals for transmission-owning utilities that do not join an RTO might also be restricted. FERC Chairman Pat Wood, speaking at an agency meeting, said he believed there should be four RTOs nationwide: one each covering the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and Western markets. ""To me at this point, the four RTOs is a good place to land,"" Wood said. Each RTO would oversee a region's electric grid to ensure all power suppliers had fair and equal access to transmission lines. In addition to the aggressive timetable for RTO formation, Wood also outlined several priorities that are included in FERC's long-term agenda, including steps to reduce market manipulation and improve the industry's infrastructure. 

Analysis: In the transition from the former FERC under the leadership of Curt H?bert to current chairman Pat Wood, it has often been projected that the new commission would become more interventionist and carry a ""big stick"" to force utilities to comply with federal requirements. Clearly, this new declaration from Chairman Wood, in his first substantial motion since becoming FERC's leader last month, demonstrates just how commanding that stick may become, along with the commission's unwavering commitment to the implementation of its comprehensive RTO plans. Quite unlike his predecessor, who sought to reduce the extent to which FERC would regulate, through his developing agenda Wood reportedly seeks to heighten the commission's role to the level of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. In other words, Wood wants FERC to create policy for the energy industry and then aggressively implement it, with RTOs being at the top of the list. 

The difference of FERC's new approach to RTOs (i.e., comparing Wood to H?bert) cannot be overstated. For the last several years, FERC has been regularly criticized for developing a policy toward RTOs that on paper called for voluntary participation by the nation's transmission-owning utilities. Wood is carving out a vastly different approach that ups the ante for RTO participation and affixes stiff penalties for those utilities that fail to comply. The new motion makes Wood's position very clear: utilities that own transmission assets must agree to turn those assets over to an RTO by Dec. 15 of this year-just over two months from now-or lose their authority to sell wholesale electricity at market rates. In addition, Wood has said that FERC should condition subsequent merger approvals on whether or not a transmission-owning utility has complied with the commission's RTO order. Interestingly, Wood maintains that FERC's evolving position on RTOs still calls for ""voluntary"" participation among utilities. However, the new chairman clearly states that if utilities don't join RTOs, they won't have access to the benefits of competitive markets. 

It is important to note that Wood acknowledges that the actual transfer of utility transmission assets may not occur for several years. The new motion from Wood calls only for utilities' agreements and specific plans to transfer their transmission assets by Dec. 15. This proposal changes an earlier FERC order that preceded Wood in which the commission called for RTOs to actually become operational by Dec. 15, which the commission now apparently realizes is not feasible. 

This ""big stick"" that FERC is now hanging over utilities does offer some benefits as well, as Wood has been quick to reiterate. For instance, FERC has already offered utilities higher regulated rates of return for transmission assets under RTO control. In addition, by turning the transmission assets over to an RTO, utilities will be removed from state regulatory oversight of the assets. Of course, it is important to note that states still control retail rates, which sets up many potential conflicts between federal and state regulatory policies. There is also a separate measure that is coming together in Congress that would eliminate the tax consequences utilities face when transferring their transmission assets to FERC-approved RTOs. Utilities often cite the costs associated with transferring their transmission assets to an RTO when resisting compliance with FERC's order. If this federal legislation is passed, transmission-owning utilities will have one less reason to resist the transfer of their transmission assets over to an independent entity. 

It is important to note that Wood's new proposals related to RTO formation are an adjunct to FERC's order from last July that mandated consolidation among existing RTOs, with the stated goal of creating four large national entities (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West). The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which already exists, is outside of FERC's jurisdiction. Four large RTOs is still the vision that FERC has in mind, and as noted Wood agrees that ""four is a good place to land."" However, the mandate on consolidation appears to be softening, at least in some regions. For instance, in the Western region, presently three separate transmission entities exist (the California ISO in California, RTO West among the Northwestern states and Desert Star among the Southwestern states). In its July order, FERC had clearly stated that it wanted to see these three entities consolidate, a point that has caused a great deal of conflict with the California ISO, which wants to remain independent. Now, Wood appears to be backing away from forcing the consolidation issue in the West and has said that FERC's stance will be ""not as aggressive"" for integrating the existing RTOs in the West. Further, Wood now says that having a single Western RTO is not imperative at this time. 

Consolidation among the existing RTOs in the Northeast appears to be moving forward. In fact, consolidation among the PJM Power Pool, the New York ISO and the New England ISO could take place as soon as the end of next year. This progress comes somewhat as a surprise, considering that the last report out of this region was that the New York ISO and New England ISO resisted the preference that had been shown for PJM's model. In the Midwest, two entities still exist (the Midwest ISO and the Alliance RTO), and Wood has said that FERC is working toward a revised agreement between the two entities that would encourage them to merge. Just recently, six investor- and public-owned power companies in the Midwest applied to FERC to form a new company to merge their electric transmission systems. Translink Transmission Co. would be a for-profit entity. It is not presently known if or how Translink may be required to conjoin with the Midwest ISO and the Alliance RTO. 

As noted, Wood has also set out a long-term agenda for FERC, covering other points beyond RTO formation. For instance, another critical issue for the commission will be potential market manipulation that might take place by various participants in deregulated environments. One of the ongoing debates related to the failure of California's deregulated market was whether or not out-of-state generators or state-affiliated entities such as the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources intentionally manipulated the state's market to impact power prices. Wood has indicated that FERC will soon release a formal policy for policing companies authorized to sell power at market rates and utilities that use transmission services bundled into state-regulated retail rates to thwart wholesale power competition. In addition, Wood has said that FERC will establish new policies related to the information that energy companies can share with their affiliates. This is a direct reference to a pending case involving El Paso Corp., in which the company has been accused of sharing market-sensitive information with one of its unregulated affiliates to gain a market edge in the natural-gas market of California. 

The other key focus area for Wood is upgrading the electricity infrastructure in the United States, which he says has not even remotely kept pace with the tremendous growth in the economy over the last 15 years. Instead of building new power lines, however, it appears that Wood supports the development of new technologies that would boost capacity on existing lines. Toward that end, FERC and the Department of Energy will hold a forum on innovative but unused energy technologies in January. Also along these lines are plans to develop uniform strategies for hooking up existing and new power plants to the transmission grid. 

Moreover, as we head toward the end of 2001, we are fast approaching the four-year anniversary of the start of electric competition in the United States (California, the first state to implement direct access, opened its market in March 1998). Four years later, the industry is still caught in somewhat of a limbo between the old structure of monopoly control and the new structure of full deregulation. Chairman Wood has assumed leadership over FERC at a time when the commission has been heavily criticized for not doing enough to limit the amount of market abuse that has arisen as a result of deregulation. At the same time, the extent to which the commission should provide regulatory oversight in a deregulated marketplace has also come under question, even by the commissioners themselves. Thus, Chairman Wood's challenge will be to push electric competition forward while taking steps to reduce the potential for market manipulation. Clearly, RTOs continue to play an integral role in these objectives and remain a top priority for FERC under the new leadership of Pat Wood.

Heavy default swap flow Invensys fears
IFR - September 22, 2001
 
Credit default swap quotes drove out last week on heavy trading volume. A rush to buy protection was met with sellers taking profits on existing short positions, or offsetting CDO exposure, and as many as 100 trades a day were seen, though deal size was often US$5m, rather than the standard US$10m.
 
The widening in quotes for airlines continued to draw attention, and most trades referencing airlines required payment of an upfront premium of as much as 20% of the notional total of the trade.
 
The most pressing threat of default may be in a company, which is not directly affected by the terrorist attacks, however. A possible breach on a loan covenant test next week by UK engineering company Invensys could prompt a debt restructuring and the first substantial exercise of default swaps seen in Europe, traders said.
 
Invensys shares collapsed last week on concerns about its debt burden and the price of its default swaps shot up. There were five-year trades seen at 425bp and 475bp, before bids jumped to 700bp, then 900bp. An offer of 1,400bp was available last Thursday, before being pulled on Friday.
 
lnvensys five-year default swaps were trading at l2Obp as recently as early August, and around the 6Obp mark earlier in the year. Traders say that swaps with a notional volume of over US$1bn are outstanding on Invensys, and with the price of its secondary debt already around 70, and set to fall further, there could be substantial pay-outs if a debt restructuring triggers default swap exercises.
 
The overall default swap market was functioning well last week, with market-makers posting two-way prices, albeit at wide bid/offer spreads. The missed lease payment by Continental Airlines has yet to trigger any swap exercise, though fears remain that a major airline will default, and traders are worried that US airline managers may find filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and a shelter from their debts an attractive option.
 
This has led to demands for upfront premium payments on any new US airline default swap trades. Dealers have been asking for US$2m payment on a US$10m trade, to ensure that some money has been gathered in the event that a default is only weeks away. The trades then feature a reduced premium of 200bp or so for a mid-term deal, paid on the usual basis of an annual fee paid quarterly.
 
A rare example of a straightforward US airline default swap last week was a five-year deal in American Airlines at 750bp. British Airways dealt at least as high as 350bp in the five-year.
 
Hotel sector quotes were hit hard, with Hilton trading at least as high as 450bp in the five-year, and prices rose in every sector. GMAC traded at l6Obp in the five-year and Ford at least as high as 165bp, while DaimlerChrysler quotes rose above 175bp.
 
Telecoms company default swaps, which have been among the worst performing this year, bucked last week's trend by holding down relative to other sectors.  Dealers think telecoms companies may benefit from increased demand if business travel is cut.
 
 
Alternative Investment Group Blasts ISDA
Derivatives Week - September 24, 2001
 
The Managed Funds Association, an alternative investment trade group with 700 members, has slammed the International Swaps and Derivatives Association for ignoring a series of letters and e-mails in which it outlined to the derivatives industry body concerns over proposed changes to the 1992 ISDA master agreement. The MFA is worried that changes to the documentation will heavily favor sellside firms. 
 
In several letters and e-mails, the most recent dated April 2, MFA President John Gaine told ISDA that three of the eight proposed amendments to the master agreement ""disproportionately favor dealers to the detriment of end users and may have the unintended consequence of increasing, as opposed to decreasing, systemic risk."" ISDA, said Gaine, did not respond. 
 
Robert Pickel, ISDA executive director in New York, conceded that ISDA never directly responded to the MFA's letters, but asserts the association addressed the MFA's concerns at an August meeting in Washington. ""We've tried to address everyone's concerns,"" said Pickel, adding that those MFA concerns that were not addressed now would likely be revisited in the next 12 months, when ISDA considers revamping the entire master agreement. 
 
However, the MFA disputes this interpretation. ""[ISDA is] drafting this from the dealers side. They weren't looking to sit down with us and work things out,"" complained Pat McCarty, MFA general counsel in Washington. He continued, ""[ISDA] don't even have the decency to send us a written response. We've gone to the trouble of writing a letter to them and they've thumbed their nose at us. I wonder if they even really care about customers."" 
 
ISDA, which began a review of the master agreement last year, was expected to begin the protocol process this week, but as of last Thursday was leaning toward pushing it back a few weeks in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. The protocol process will entail ISDA working with dealers and end users to incorporate amendments into its trade agreements. 
 
Not every end user shares the MFA's sense of injustice. William Miller, independent risk oversight officer for the End Users of Derivatives Council of the Association of Financial Professionals, which organized the August meeting in Washington, said he is ""very encouraged"" by the attention ISDA paid to end user concerns at the August meeting. He added that ISDA is beginning to realize that in the future it needs to consider end users before it begins drafting changes. 
 
 
Basle relaxes operational risk rules
IFR - September 22, 2001
 
The more flexible stance on operational risk included in the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision's soon-to-be released discussion paper on Basle II's operational risk charge is set to go down well with banks. In the paper, the overall capital charge is lower, and the advanced approach has been opened up to allow banks to use an internal loss-distribution approach or scorecard analysis for operational risk.
 
""It is not as prescriptive about inputs [for operational risk], It's more like market risk,"" said an official at the Bank for International Settlements, noting that certain criteria will have to be met. ""It will be up to national supervisors to judge [banks' internal methodologies],"" he said. The paper will be released before the end of the week.
 
Rather than settle on a benchmark figure for the industry, the Committee's paper will offer a temporary benchmark for illustrative purposes. The temporary benchmark will be based on an analysis
 
of economic capital data from the quantitative impact study conducted earlier this year. A proposal for the level of the floor will be included in the discussion paper, the official said, declining to elaborate.
 
The BIS announced in June that the proposed capital accord's 20% operational risk charge would be reduced after many banks submitted comment letters stating that their internal capital models for operational risk are far lower than 20%. The Basle proposal's operational risk charge resulted from an industry poll undertaken last year. Many banks participating in the survey used a broad definition of operational risk and as such overstated the amount of capital allocated to the risk.
 
 
Rainfall Derivatives
Derivatives Week - September 24, 2001
 
Despite the high exposure of businesses to rainfall risk most weather derivatives that have been traded have been based on a temperature indices. Nevertheless many end users, such as farmers or hydroelectric generators, are sensitive to rainfall magnitude and frequency. The consequences of too much or not enough rain are spread widely and, directly or indirectly, we all suffer from abnormal rainfall magnitudes. 
 
A typical difficulty with risk analysis based on rainfall is that the magnitude and the frequency of rainfall strongly depend on the site where it is measured whereas the temperature is a more ambient measure. By way of example, if at Heathrow the temperature is 20?C then you can assume that the temperature in central London is near 20?C. However, even if it rains heavily in Heathrow you cannot assume that it will rain simultaneously in central London. There is a high positive probably it does, but it is not 100%. 
 
Until now rainfall process studies have been limited to either cumulative rain over a given period, mainly monthly and yearly, or on the rainfall process over a small time period, such as every five or six minutes. The first topic is quite limited and lacks interest for weather derivatives purposes. The second one is very detailed but irrelevant for market transactions. Instead of statistically analysing the rain, it may be preferable to simulate it. 
 
Only Heathrow data are used from now on. 
 
 
Frequency 
The first step in building a stochastic rainfall process is to understand with which probability rainfall occurs. Figure 1 presents the historical frequency rainfall at Heathrow. 
 
The frequency curve is not symmetric and a sinusoidal function might be inadequate to fit it. A smoothing process can be used to correct erratic values (smooth line). Subsequent results are strongly dependent on these probabilities; thus the extraction must be done cautiously. 
 
The Rainfall Persistence 
The probability that it rains depends on the day of the year. But does it also depend on the past? Without doubt in the case of Heathrow, it appears that when the weather is dry, the following day is more likely to be dry than rainy, and vice versa. So the probability that it rains is conditional on the past. But the probability that it rains depends on the time of year. As a consequence, it is more likely to rain two consecutive days during wintertime than in summertime and the reverse in summertime. Therefore a natural autocorrelation is created which interferes with a possible true autocorrelation. 
 
The model of the persistence of rain is set hereafter. 
 
We note Xt the event ""it rains at day t"". Xt is Bernoulli distributed: 
 

 
 
Where 1 is for the event ""it rains"". 
 
We know the historical mean of Xt from our first studies. However, this is insufficient to model the time series Xt. As a matter of fact, assuming the independence of Xt we have E[Xt | Xt-1, Xt-2, Xt-3] = E[Xt] = pt which is different from EH[Xt] (the operator EH is for the historical mean). Therefore the probability pt has a time dependent expectation and is conditional to Xt-1, Xt-2, Xt-3,... 
 
A recurrence is produced to estimate the order of this lag dependence. The probability pt is assumed to be given by: pt = Prob(Xt = 1 | Xt-1, Xt-2 Xt-3 Xt-k), with k IN*. 
 
The aim is to extract the minimum value of k that produces the best fit of the distribution of the length of period of rain. Considering a 365 day year, we assume that E[pt] = E[pt+365] which means that the climate does not vary over years. We first estimate conditional probabilities with k=1, then simulate the process and compare the simulated distribution of the length of the period to the smoothed historical one. Then the method is reproduced with higher values of k until no more information on the probability pt is added. 
 
Assuming independence between successive rainy days we have simulated the rainfall below using the historical probability for 38 years (the same length of period from which the graph below has been calculated). Supposing k=1 a good fit is already obtained: 
 
 
 
The Magnitude Process 
 
Once the length of the rainy period is known the intensity of the rainfall must be evaluated for each day. The previous study didn't reveal a dependence on the length of the rainy period. But studies show that there is a dependence on the length of the period. 
 
Since the average conditional to the previous day is different, the distribution is certainly different. Only four events can be enumerated for a rainy day t under the assumption k=1: Rt-1 / Rt / Rt+1 or NRt-1 / Rt / Rt+1 or Rt-1 / Rt / NRt+1 or NRt-1 / Rt / NRt+1 with Rt the event it rains at day t and NRt the event no rain at day t. Four distributions for each day of the year should be estimated. In order to reduce estimation bias errors a 30-day period bracketing the day for which the distributions are worked out is considered. 
 
The main characteristics are summarised in this table: 
 

 
 
The four distributions are very different from each other. The average (resp. maximum) between the event Rt-1 / Rt / Rt+1and NRt-1 / Rt / NRt+1 is approximately divided by 2.5 (resp. 3.5). One can conclude that the distribution of the magnitude of rainfalls depends on the immediate past and future. 
 
Doing the same for each day of the year, all the required information to run the simulations properly is eventually obtained. First, all the rainy days are simulated and then the magnitude of rain is randomly generated using the correct distribution between the four possible ones for each day. 
 
Conclusion 
Rainfall magnitude is extremely dependent upon the location where it is measured. This risk can be as high as 100% in a single month for close locations, approximately 20 miles. Because the probability that it rains is non-constant during a whole year, this phenomenon creates a natural autocorrelation in the process. This pitfall has to be avoided and the rainfall process can be decompounded into two steps. The first stage is the frequency process and the second stage is the magnitude given the frequency. In order to know the distribution of the rainfall magnitude, it is just as important to know if it rained the previous day as if it will rain the next day.

Ken,

I don't know if you are the right person for this - but I thought that someone should register Enron in the new domain(s) asap before we lose them.

Although I am in IT, I am not really in the right area and neither is my direct chain of command (although I think they are just great to work for)

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1569000/1569222.stm

Sorry to have troubled you, but I KNOW that if I mention it, then you will get it to the right person for consideration.

Many thanks

"Memo to Board re Trading Practice Issues","In the wake of last week's disaster, we have had numerous requests for
contingency decisions on issues of a trading practice nature. We are
compiling a list of these questions for review by ISDA's Trading Practice
Committee, chaired by Jonathan Moulds at Bank of America.

If your firm has experienced or if you are aware of any such issues in
relation to the market disruptions (eg: how to establish CMS/CMT rates for
those days), please would you be prepared to raise them at tomorrow's Board
Meeting. If necessary, ISDA may subsequently ask its Trading Practice
Advisory Group to convene to address these issues.

"New Start","We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Louise
