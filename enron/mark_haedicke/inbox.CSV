2.2	Service Level Agreement.  EBS will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the EBS Services in accordance with Appendix 2 to the Services Agreement; provided, however, Microsoft shall not be entitled to Liquidated Damages or other damages in the event of any SLA Failure.  Microsoft recognizes that the EBS Services has yet been through testing and that as a result the performance of the EBS will be negatively impacted.  EBS will use commercially reasonably efforts to test the system concurrently with delivering the EBS Services. NOTE:  (This may not be necessary as 1) there are no damages  2)  we are only held to a commercially reasonable standard anyway.

	2.3	Termination for Convenience.  Microsoft shall not be entitled to terminate the Services Agreement for convenience or for any other reason, except as expressly set forth in Sections 12.1.1, 12.1.2, and 12.1.4 of the Services Agreement.  Also 12.1.3  (EBS right to terminate)?

"In re F&J Representation","

	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

Paul:

I hate to bug you but I was wondering if you knew anyone from your London
office who would be keen to join the e-commerce panel discussion from 10:45
AM to 11:30 AM.  Andy Zipper, Chief Commercial Officer of EnronOnline spoke
at a similar conference we held last March in Houston.  

About 4 different firms will be represented on the E-Commerce Panel
Discussion.  The moderator will give each speaker about 5 minutes to talk
about any or all of the following: 

?	Why Some Platforms are Successful
?	The Impact of E-trading on Standardized Documentation
?	Future Challenges

Of course, we don't want this to be a marketing pitch but we do want
attendees to have a basic idea of who the speaker is and how their firm and
its services are similar or different. This should take up to half an hour.
For the remaining time, there would be an open discussion. The moderator
will pose questions, which will be confirmed to them beforehand. 

Attached is a copy of the agenda.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks - Liz

Paul,

That's great - thank you.  Both Richard and Rita have agreed to
co-present.
Rita will speak both on dealing with different documentation in Europe
for
similar products and on the benefits of a bridge.  Richard will speak on
the
benefits of using annexes to a single master agreement.  I think a
PowerPoint presentation works best.  Please coordinate presentations to
prevent duplication.  The panel will have 45 minutes to cover all topics
and
you should leave time at the end for Q&A.  Time designated to each
presentation is entirely up to the group.

Paul Simons (Tel: 44 20 7783-6566)

I will fax or email all the necessary speaker information soon.

Let me know if any of you have any questions.

Sorry for the delay in responding.

I am glad to confirm that I would be delighted to give a presentation at
10-45 am on Physical v Financial Trading documentation/issues.
Unfortunately, that is all I will have time for owing to other Enron
commitments related to our financial year end that will make it
impossible to take any more time out of the office than this.  I hope
that this works for you.

A few of questions, if I may:

 - will a power point presentation be appropriate?

 - how long will the presentation last?

 - Have Rita and Richard agreed to co-present? If so, do you have Rita's
telephone number so we can liaise (I know Richard's)?

Thanks and kind regards

Subject:  Credit Derivatives Issue


******************************************************************
 This message originated from the Internet. Its originator may or

 the message and any attachments may or may not be accurate.
******************************************************************

You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in
the
credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in the
UK.
ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement
regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others are
either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not issue
a statement.

Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible
bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. What
is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of ""Not
Contingent"" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typically
required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that the
payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at the
option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of
the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercise
the conversion (sometimes referred to as a ""widows and orphans"" clause) is
a
standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion
right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so.
In
the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trustee
to convert exists.

A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, the
User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in the
next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the
""group of six"" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, we
suggest that ""plain vanilla"" convertible bonds should satisfy the ""Not
Contingent"" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. ""Plain
vanilla"" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion
is at the option of the holder of the trustee.

A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) is
scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything prior
to that meeting.

I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement
regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their views
on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are also
discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how
we
might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share your
views with the other addressees of this email, as they are coordinating the
views of members.

Bob

Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.

"Asset Dispositions--""Success Fees""","Mark and Jeff: There is an impression circulating among some of the commercial teams that their compensation may be directly linked to asset dispositions, ie. success fees.  Apparently, this may have started due to ""rumors"" that the London Receiver is allowing for such payments--for example, the pending Arcos turbine sale.  This is unsubstantiated, but may be worthy of inquiry.  Accordingly, in at least one domestic example, it is my understanding that the deal team was fairly unmotivated until they heard about the London ""arrangement"" and are now pursuing with great exuberance.  Maybe this is a good thing, but clearly an arrangement that needs to be vetted and then communicated so people understand what the ""rules"" may be.

Let me know how I may assist in addressing this.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"ESA government negotiations","We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:  

     1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$191million or US$ 73 million.

       2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million. 

       3.  Parcel  ""A"" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

U.S. Power Firms Plunge Into Europe's Trading Market; 
U.K.'s NETA Rules May Set Continental Standard 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] U.S.-owned Entergy-Koch Trading (NYSE: EKT) is boosting its European electricity and weather trading business with expansion in Germany and the Netherlands. ""After a successful start, we plan to substantially increase our volume of European power, power options and weather trading next year,"" said Uday Narang, managing director of European trading. EKT also completed the paperwork needed to start trading electricity in France and Austria, although its immediate focus would be Germany and the Netherlands. 

Analysis: The announcement from Entergy-Koch Trading that it will significantly increase its European power trading business is by no means unique. In fact, a recent scan of announcements from U.S. power firms tells a similar story. Dynegy announced last week that it is seeking acquisitions to strengthen its European operations, in an effort to ""replicate its strong U.S. energy trading platform in Europe."" TXU said that it expects ""sharply higher profits this year"" from European energy trading as its electricity trading volumes have soared across the Continent. For the first nine months of 2001, TXU reportedly traded 211 terawatt hours of wholesale electricity in continental Europe, mostly in Germany, which compared to 97 terawatt hours in all of 2000. Further still, UtiliCorp just announced that it and an unnamed financial partner will be purchasing Midlands Electricity, the fourth-largest regional electric utility in the United Kingdom, which in addition to 38,000 miles of electric distribution lines owns a 1,875-MW power plant. The unrelated announcements have a common denominator: U.S. power firms are plunging into the European energy trading market in droves, despite some inherent governmental challenges and resistance toward embracing electric competition among some European countries. A new model in the United Kingdom, known as the new energy trading agreement (NETA) rules, appear to be facilitating more efficient trade in that country and could become the standard across the Continent. 

The appeal of Europe's power market for U.S. energy companies is perhaps obvious. According to a Financial Times Energy report from late last year, demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity to be built (an amount roughly equivalent to the generating capacity of ERCOT in Texas). In addition, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption has grown over the last two years. U.S. power firms, who perhaps see their competitive opportunities as being rather limited in this country, have expanded operations in Europe, where electric privatization is occurring on a country-by-country basis. Consequently, the companies mentioned above join Williams, Enron, Duke, AEP, and Mirant (to name a few), which have established London trading offices. 

Moreover, many of the U.S. power firms that expand into Europe start by accumulating generation assets in the United Kingdom, as represented by the UtiliCorp and Dynegy announcements. Much of this has to do with the fact that the United Kingdom began privatizing its electric market in the early 1990s and completed the process in May 1999 (after Norway, but well ahead of other European countries). However, there is a more important reason why U.S. energy firms may be drawn to U.K. power trading, and that is related to the area's unique rules for energy transactions, which were outlined in NETA and took effect in March of this year. 

To appreciate the significance of the new NETA rules, it is important to first understand the context of the European market as a whole and the trading system that had been in place in the United Kingdom until earlier this year. The European Union has directed countries across the Continent to open their electric markets to competition. Toward this end, the commencement of competition in various European countries has included the following three approaches: 1) allowing end-users the right to select an alternative provider; 2) giving generation companies the right to use an incumbent power supplier's transmission and distribution network, otherwise known as third-party access; and 3) the introduction of energy trading, which has allowed an incumbent supplier to buy power on the wholesale market. This last point is significant, because some of the European countries have dismantled previously integrated, state-owned utilities and mandated the divestiture of generation assets. 

At the end of 2000, approximately 68.4 percent of the European Union (EU) electricity market was open to competition. Privatization has theoretically enabled European power companies to expand beyond their traditional service territories and business lines into other countries (at least those that are open). That is the good news. However, the basic problem with this approach is that the European Union did not put standardized deadlines for the transition to a fully competitive marketplace, and thus various countries in Europe have developed their own timetables. For instance, Germany is fully privatized, while France has been notoriously hesitant to provide third-party access to competitors. In practice, this often means that one country may have an extremely complex system for transmission tariffs while its neighboring country may have not developed any standards at all. The other problem is that physical interconnections between countries are often deficient, which makes it difficult to transport power across borders. As a result, wholesale competition across the Continent is considered rather heterogeneous and lacking in comprehensive trading standards. The lack of standards is particularly acute as it relates to rules and tariffs for third-party access to the national grids on the Continent. 

While these fundamental problems on the Continent are being resolved, the United Kingdom has moved ahead with what is generally perceived as a more efficient market because it offers one grid system, one balancing and settlement code, and one contract format. However, even the power trading market in the United Kingdom did not get off to an easy start. Up until March of this year, the U.K. power market operated under a pool / auction system. Under that model, generation companies offered electricity for sale, which was then pooled into an auction system where day-ahead bids were made and power was sold in half-hour increments. The model was quite significant because it was one of the first attempts in the world to create a competitive market for generation and it operated outside of governmental oversight. 

However, the pool model in the United Kingdom became fraught with problems, mostly because observers believed that excessive opportunity existed for market manipulation. Given the concerns with the pool format, the United Kingdom began to formulate new rules for power trading in October 1998, which culminated in the NETA model that started this year. The key tenets that make NETA different from the previous pool model are: 

Forwards and futures markets, which allow participants to form power sale deals using standardized contracts either on-the-day or several years in advance (as opposed to only day-ahead bids). 
More flexibility regarding the kinds of contracts that buyers and sellers can negotiate (bilateral and multilateral contracts are allowed in the United Kingdom). 
A new balancing mechanism covering ancillary services overseen by National Grid Co. (operating in a role similar to an ISO), which facilitates the various transactions to ensure reliability. 
The administration of contracts linking wholesale supplies with demand (represented by individual meters), and the threat of strict penalties for participants whose positions do not match their metered volumes of electricity. 



In a nutshell, NETA essentially sharpened the rules surrounding power trading in the United Kingdom to allow less opportunity for gaming. The system improvements have been successful, and more international power firms apparently believe that they stand a better chance of competing in the United Kingdom due to the NETA rules. Installation of the NETA system reportedly has caused a 315-percent increase in the number of contracts traded, a 25-percent drop in wholesale prices and a six-fold increase in the variety of products offered. As of early summer 2001, about 150 new participants had registered to participate under the NETA system, as compared with about 12 under the former model. 

As noted, many believe that the NETA model will become a standard for the Continent as other European countries proceed with opening their wholesale markets to competition. In addition to the U.K.'s model, there are several active trading exchanges in Europe presently, although more are expected to emerge as the market becomes more competitive. The Nord Pool, with about 60 members, organizes trade in standardized physical and financial contracts, and provides current prices on electricity in both spot and futures markets. The Dutch Amsterdam Power Exchange has about 25 members and operates a spot market for electrical power. Smaller European exchanges, offering both spot and futures contracts, include the Switzerland Exchange and Germany's Leipzig Power Exchange in Frankfurt. In the meantime, I think we will continue to see additional U.S. power firms expanding into the European trading market, and using the United Kingdom as their launch pad.

"Memo:  Re: Bank of England Application","I think that the BOE should be admitted to membership.

Also, Bob, about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), following the
recent seminar we did for them in HK, I think that we are likely to hear
more from them about membership. Frankly, it is easy for me to raise the
issue with David Carse/Simon Topping, which might well precipitate a formal
application, but obviously I would rather not do so without hearing further
from the Board about the potential success of such an application.

It is probably best if I write separately about the HKMA and its functions
including why membership for them might make sense. At that point, further
discussion would be useful.

Subject:  Bankof England Application


******************************************************************
 This message originated from the Internet. Its originator may or
 may not be who they claim to be and the information contained in
 the message and any attachments may or may not be accurate.
******************************************************************

Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received
an
application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we
have
considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,
consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives
activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely
to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have
generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark
and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have
even
admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we
let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA
materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there
may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.

In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been
expressed
if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for
membership.
These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the
regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to
influence the process.

Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of
England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has
correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional
central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market
and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.

In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously
expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the
application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the
Hong
Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received
an application.

Please share your views with the other members of the Board.

Bob

El Paso Corp. Absolved of Manipulation Charges (For Now), 
But Affiliate Abuse Allegations Linger 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] El Paso Corp. (NYSE: EPG) was cleared on Oct. 9 of manipulating natural-gas prices in California, but the agency judge overseeing the case expressed impatience with company executives who engaged in what he described as ""hanky panky"" in arranging pipeline shipments. Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, ruled that El Paso did not unfairly drive up natural-gas prices on its four pipelines into energy-starved California last year, but used blunt language in assessing the behavior of two executives with the Houston-based energy giant. Wagner said telephone records of the conversations showed ""blatant collusion"" between company affiliates in booking pipeline space at a discounted rate for future shipments. 

Analysis: The best assessment of this ruling in the ongoing case against El Paso Corp. is that it is a mixed bag of judgments, and only one more step in what will continue to be a very long and drawn-out case. On one hand, the FERC administrative law judge appears to be absolving El Paso Corp. of the accusations that it intentionally manipulated conditions in California to gain market power over the state's natural-gas market. That is the good news for El Paso Corp. However, on the other hand, the same judge has also intensified lingering claims that El Paso exclusively shared market-sensitive information between its affiliates, violating a FERC standard of conduct that a pipeline must give information about natural-gas transportation to all potential shippers as well as a company's own marketing affiliates. Further, as noted Judge Curtis Wagner has indicated that existing telephone records from last year indicate ""blatant collusion"" between El Paso Corp. company affiliates, potentially violating FERC rules that a pipeline's operating staff and the staff of its marketing affiliate function independently of each other. The next step in this case will be to determine any possible fines that might be affixed by the full FERC commission on the basis of the alleged collusion or affiliate abuse issues. 

The case against El Paso Corp. is a very complicated one, but it essentially comes down to one core issue. The case revolves around allegations that during the period of May to November 2000 El Paso improperly shared market-sensitive information with one of its affiliates, which drove up natural-gas prices, pre-empted competition from non-affiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range of $3.7 billion for Californians. El Paso Corp. has consistently maintained that it engaged in no wrongdoing. The case has carried enormous significance for the energy industry as it impacts not only the profits earned by El Paso Corp. but also the degree to which federal regulators may continue to intercede into wholesale markets. In addition, the other key aspect to this case is the extent to which FERC, under the leadership of new Chairman Pat Wood, will exhibit strong regulatory oversight over these claims of market abuse and issue its own harsh financial penalties against El Paso Corp. 

What is critically new about this case is the information now available from transcripts of phone conversations between El Paso affiliates. First, let me establish some background that will help to explain the significance of the transcripts. El Paso Corp. is the parent of subsidiaries El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy, which are the companies in question regarding the California transactions. El Paso Natural Gas, a regulated company, operates pipelines and El Paso Merchant Energy, which is unregulated, markets natural gas. El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Division pipeline, which includes 14,604 miles of interstate transmission pipeline, serving markets in California, the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and throughout the Rocky Mountains. In early 2000, El Paso Natural Gas awarded approximately one-third of the capacity on this interstate pipeline to El Paso Merchant Energy. This contract essentially gave subsidiaries of El Paso Corp. control over transporting about one-sixth of the state's daily demand in California. As such, this gave the El Paso affiliates between 35 and 45 percent of the Southern California gas market, clearly positioning it as the largest natural-gas provider in the state. 

As subsidiaries, all of El Paso's operations fall under FERC's ""arms-length"" rule, which enforces a separation between affiliated production and pipeline companies that exist within a corporate family. Since early 2001, FERC has been examining allegations that El Paso manipulated natural-gas prices in California by blocking competitors' access to the interstate pipeline. California officials have claimed that El Paso subsidiaries secretly shared information about the pipeline that was not available to other companies. Specifically, the transcripts of phone conversations between executives at El Paso Merchant and Mojave Pipeline Co., an El Paso affiliate, reportedly include comments from El Paso Merchant that inquire about a delay in publishing information about the pipeline's available capacity to all potential competitors. 

The existence of these phone records gave some credence to ongoing claims that El Paso had shared what should have been public information only with its affiliates. According to Reuters, the executive at El Paso Merchant asked the executive at Mojave Pipeline to hold off on posting competitive data about the capacity on the pipeline for a week. This allegation has important ramifications. First, the sharing of this non-public information might mean that El Paso's subsidiaries had provided preferential treatment to affiliated subsidiaries, which gave the company as a whole an unlawful advantage over competitors. Any potential abuse of affiliate standards could include the unlawful exchange of classified information between subsidiaries or the extension of discounted prices between two affiliated companies. Yet, according to Judge Wagner this sharing of information among affiliates did not contribute to a clear case of market power abuse, and in fact should be dismissed outright, which is why the ruling is such a mixed bag for El Paso Corp. 

Nevertheless, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison may continue to fight the case with an appeal on the ruling that could be launched within 30 days. According to the California parties, this alleged manipulation cost Californians an extra $3.7 billion in unnecessary power purchase costs that the two utilities are still attempting to recover. It is important to note that San Diego Gas & Electric, California's third IOU, purchases all of its natural-gas supply from Southern California Gas and is therefore not a participant in this case against El Paso. 

In response, El Paso has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including market manipulation or inappropriate sharing of information between its affiliates, and thus has not violated any standards set out by FERC in its ""arms-length"" policy applied to affiliates. Instead, El Paso claims that the seemingly high prices that it charged in California resulted solely from nationally high gas prices. However, according to the Energy Information Administration, delivery prices for natural gas in California during the October 2000 to January 2001 timeframe were considerably higher than other national markets. For instance, during this time period, natural-gas prices in California were running near $23/MMBtu, while prices at Henry Hub and in Florida were at around $7/MMBtu. 

El Paso says the sudden drop in natural-gas prices once its contract on the pipeline expired is the result of constraints that are inherent in California's distribution system. In addition, the company claims that mild weather in the region and increased storage levels of natural gas have also driven the dramatic price swing. Further, El Paso says that it hedged most of its gas capacity into California to protect itself from potential losses, cutting potential profits in the process. The significance of this, El Paso contends, is that the company's hedging indicates that it had no foreknowledge that gas prices would be higher than normal. In other words, El Paso hedged on its gas supply because the company thought that prices would be flat or go down. On the other hand, hedging is a common practice among seasoned traders and gas traders have countered that hedged contracts are often resold at higher multiples before the gas is ultimately delivered. 

It will be interesting to see where this case goes from here. As noted, the ""new"" FERC that has emerged under the leadership of Pat Wood may demonstrate a decidedly lower tolerance for any allegations of affiliate abuse and consequently issue stiff penalties. In addition, it is interesting to note that other pending affiliate abuse cases have recently been launched by FERC, indicating that the commission is increasing its efforts to investigate such abuse. For instance, last week FERC ordered an inquiry into whether Exelon Corp., PECO Energy and their affiliates improperly manipulated Northeast power markets in 1999 by possibly sharing non-public information. Further, Wood has made no bones about the fact that he embraces a market philosophy that includes regulatory intervention when necessary. Consequently, Wood could very well spearhead a re-examination of FERC's methodology regarding market-based rates in markets that become deregulated, along with how merchant plants calculate their rates, and the ruling on potential fines against El Paso Corp. could be the first indication of this policy change.

Subject: Credit Derivatives Issue


> You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in
the
> credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in the
UK.
> ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement
> regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others are
> either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not
issue
> a statement.
>
> Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible
> bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. What
> is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of ""Not
> Contingent"" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typically
> required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that the
> payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
> contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at the
> option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option
of
> the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercise
> the conversion (sometimes referred to as a ""widows and orphans"" clause) is
a
> standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
> bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion
> right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so.
In
> the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
> beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trustee
> to convert exists.
>
> A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
> Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
> review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, the
> User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in the
> next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the
> ""group of six"" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, we
> suggest that ""plain vanilla"" convertible bonds should satisfy the ""Not
> Contingent"" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. ""Plain
> vanilla"" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion
> is at the option of the holder of the trustee.
>
> A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) is
> scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything
prior
> to that meeting.
>
> I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement
> regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their
views
> on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are also
> discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how
we
> might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share your
> views with the other addressees of this email, as they are coordinating
the
> views of members.

Subject:	In re F&J Representation
Importance:	High



	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

"Energy Capital Resources Funding Commitments","Based upon my review of the files and discussions with other lawyers and other business people:

Ameritex Ventures II, Ltd.-  No further funding commitment exists.
Nutech Energy Alliance, Ltd. - A DASH has been approved for funding $2,627,000 million.  $592,000 has been funded.  There is no known legal documentation of a commitment to fund any additional amount.  It is unclear what expectations other partners may have regarding future fundings by the Enron entity.
Texland Limited Partnership -  An AFE for $4 million has been approved but funding will not be required until next year.  Approximately $1 million/month for the first four months of 2002 will most likely be required.
Andex Credit Facility - Fundings are in the sole discretion of ECTMI as the agent.
Tri-C Resources - ENA is committed to fund $30,000-40,000 of general and administrative expenses this year.
Westwin Energy I Limited Partnership - Additional capital contributions require unanimous consent of the partners.  A Dash has been approved for $7,400,000 contingent upon certain levels of success and an engineer's report.
Hanson - No further funding obligations exists.

Joseph

As per my voicemail, I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. Could I ask that you confirm the following regarding RMTC - Global Markets:

Mark Haedicke and yourself are directors, and therefore authorised signatories of the company
Would your signature be required on any new trading agreement?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Subject:	Light Call Option of 50MW

ECE is negotiating the sale of a Call Option to Light, the distribution company in Rio de Janeiro, owned by EDF. See below a summary of the main terms of this deal:

Seller: 		ECE
Buyer:		Light
Volume:	50 MW
Term:		January 1st, 2002 to December 31st, 2003
Structure:	Call Option (details below)

Premium:	R$ 38/MWh for the energy in 2002 and R$ 30/MWh for the energy in 2003. The total premium will be R$ 29.78 million and it will be paid upfront		on the date of contract signature.

Strike Price:	R$ 210/MWh for volume delivered during 2002 and R$ 130/MWh for volume delivered in 2003. Prices will be adjusted by IGPM from 			Sept/2001 until the Exercise Date in both cases.

Exercise Date:	Buyer will have the right to exercise the Option on a weekly basis. The notification of the exercise will have to be made until tuesday 			before beggining of supply week.

Guaranties:	Since it's very difficult to get Corp Guaranty from European Companies, we thought about asking Light's receivables as guaranty from 			Light and if necessary, Enron Corp Guaranty from ECE. Light has a 30 years concession for electricity distribution in the city of Rio de Janeiro and 		is rated as a BB- by S&P.
Since it is not a small transaction we need to know if Credit, Market risk and Tax are comfortable with the structure. I'm going to send more details about Light for Credit review. Please, let me know if you need any additional clarification.
Thanks. Eduardo

"RE: ISDA North American Energy and Developing Products Committee Meet ing - November 2 - Canadian Issues","Stacy:

It occurred to me that members of the North American Energy and Developing
Products Committee might be interested in participating in a discussion
about one of the changes to the Ontario Market Rules that is currently being
considered by the Board of Directors of the IMO (the Independent Electricity
Market Operator in Ontario).

The Ontario Market Rules have, to date, been designed such that generators
of electricity will receive a 5 minute price (EMP or energy market price)
from the IMO, and consumers of electricity receive an hourly price (the HOEP
or hourly Ontario energy price).  The HOEP was calculated as the weighted
average of the EMP for an hour.  For a variety of reasons, the IMO has now
decided to change the way that the HOEP is calculated, such that it will be
the straight average of the EMP's for the hour.  

Customers have already entered into swaps, fixing the price at which they
will purchase electricity, in which they pay a fixed price and receive the
HOEP in return.  Therefore, if the quantum of the HOEP is now different than
is was based under the formula in effect when the contract was entered into,
the economics of the deal have changed.

It's not clear at this time how material this change in calculation will be.
Will it make a $0.05 difference to the HOEP, or a $3.00 difference to the
HOEP?  In other words, is it a Material Change in Formula?

Let me know if you think this might be of interest to the members.

If you decide that you'd like to have an update re that status of the new
Ontario electricity market, I'd be happy to do so.  It won't take more than
2-3 minutes, as nothings changed dramatically since July.  All parties are
proceeding on the assumption that the market will open in the Spring (a
specific date has not yet been established).    

If, however, anyone has any specific questions that they'd like to have

Private Investors Align to Upgrade California's Path 15; 
Project Causes New State / Federal Conflicts 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] The federal government has reached a deal with a coalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central California under a $300-million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state. Construction on the so-called Path 15 project, which was announced by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, will begin in the spring of 2003 and could be completed by as early as summer 2004. 

Analysis: The California energy crisis, which clearly subsided over the summer of 2001 due to new generation that came online in the state, mild weather patterns and conservation efforts, is generally considered the result of a severe supply / demand imbalance. While this may be true, what often gets overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the state-the lines that actually transport power from point A to point B-also played a primary role in creating the tremendous instability of California's energy market. This problem still persists today, and as California heads into the winter season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing. The Department of Energy (DOE) has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing a massive upgrade to California's main transmission line. While this is a positive step, the upgrade creates a new level of state / federal disputes for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into the hands of private companies, which creates a whole new set of potential conflicts. 

Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path 15 upgrade, there are some things that we know for sure. First, Path 15, which is owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., is a 90-mile high-voltage section of transmission capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern California. During the peak of the energy crisis in California, Path 15 became rather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks (points at which transmission could not transport high volumes of power). This pre-empted any transport of power from Southern California (and Arizona and Mexico) to the north, which resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern California cities. As noted, these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly acute during times of peak power demand, which is obviously a concern as winter approaches. 

The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the state's energy market. Ironically, power supply is no longer seen as an imminent problem. New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state should have operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 MW this winter, which has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous winter season. However, the report on the state's transmission system is not as positive. If the Northwest continues to experience a drought, then Northern California will still need to import more power from the south. Heavy dependence on the strained Path 15 could once again cause reliability problems for California. 

Thus, deficiencies along Path 15 can be seen as a symptom of larger problems that continue to plague California, and problems that have been the focus of both state and federal intervention for months, if not years. In fact, there is a history here that is worth noting, especially as it relates to federal / state jurisdiction. When President Bush released his national energy plan in April of this year, he directed the DOE to explore efforts that would relieve congestion along Path 15. Following through with this order, Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited responses from 13 companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path 15. The current contract, which will add a new line to the existing Path 15, is the result of that previous directive. 

At present, it appears that PG&E Corp. (NYSE: PCG), the parent of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., and six other companies have signed on to financially support the upgrade. The six other companies that will spearhead the project are the Transmission Agency of Northern California, Trans-Elect, Inc., Kinder Morgan Power Co., PG&E National Energy Group, Williams Energy Marketing and Trading, and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), a federal agency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in 15 western states and operates 17,000 miles of transmission lines. 

Presently, Path 15 connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of the state's largest generation facilities-Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diablo Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energy's Morro Bay natural-gas power plant. The upgrade will reportedly include a new 500-kilovolt line that would boost transmission by about 1,500 MW from these two plants. Further, when the upgrade is finished in 2004, Path 15 should be able to carry a total of 5,400 MW of power. 

Of course, the first question that I asked was: Who is going to pay for the upgrade? The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain 10-percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line. The remaining 90 percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting different amounts of capital to fund the upgrade. The exact percentages of investment (and ownership) have yet to be defined, but should be revealed in a subsequent plan outlined in the next 90 days. You may ask why these companies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California. The answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments through fees charged to use the new transmission line. This could result in a hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project, who presumably anticipate that California will remain a high-demand state through which huge amounts of power will need to be transported. 

As I mentioned, there are some potential conflicts that might arise with this upgrade plan. First, there is the issue of potential state / federal regulatory conflicts. Presently, state governments have jurisdiction over power line siting. Thus, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) had already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path 15 prior to Secretary Abraham's call for private-company bids. Specifically, the CPUC had directed Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which it regulates, to upgrade the bottleneck spots along Path 15. As seems to be a growing occurrence, we may find that there is a state / federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulatory body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in California. Gov. Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is the state's prerogative, and have issued strong criticisms over the DOE's venture into this territory. However, in his energy plan, President Bush seemed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obtain transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission capacity. If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE, it is not known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area. In any event, representatives from Trans-Elect, one of the participating companies, have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state (and public and private) interests will be one of the key challenges for the upgrade project. Note that Trans-Elect was the company that had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California Edison earlier this year. 

Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOE's upgrade plan for Path 15 are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a major piece of California's transmission grid. The DOE-sponsored upgrade, unlike the one that the CPUC has directed, reportedly would not be subject to review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC. Further, because the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the new line, these companies will be able to charge ""tolls"" to the power marketers that use the lines to transport power. This is most likely a point of contention for California officials, especially Gov. Gray Davis, who has sought state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on private-company ownership of generation facilities in the state. The positive side of this issue is that, according to the DOE, the bids from private contracts enable the upgrade of Path 15 to proceed without any increase to ""either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of America."" 

As a side note, in addition to Path 15 the CPUC is also proceeding with a new transmission line in Southern California, known as the Valley-Rainbow Interconnect transmission line. Although the timetable has been delayed until 2005, San Diego Gas & Electric is proceeding with a 500,000-volt transmission line that would connect Southern California Edison's Valley Substation near Romoland, Calif., with a future substation to be located in the Rainbow, Calif. area, just south of the Riverside-San Diego county line. The new transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDG&E's and SCE's transmission systems. The first interconnection is at the San Onofre Substation near San Clemente, Calif. The project is designed to deliver approximately 1,000 MW. 

Moreover, the expansion of Path 15 is a necessary step to help California lower its risk for further reliability problems. Due to generation development, the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished, but the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors. The state government still has its hand in power purchases, which represents a huge part of the state's energy market. The state has accrued $12.5 billion in debt to buy power for the state's utilities, the recovery for which remains an unresolved issue. While Gov. Davis has preferred to increase the state's role in California's energy infrastructure, this new DOE-sponsored project on Path 15 puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands of private companies.

"RE: FW: ENE/ENA Change of Ownership Diligence Inquiry","The 11/1 e-mail (excerpt below) also notes that no event of default otherwise would occur, a fact specific inquiry; e.g., debt to cap ratio upon consummation of the merger:

Typical merger provisions provide that either (i) ENE survive or if not, (ii) 
the survivor be organized under U.S. (or state thereof) law, 
assume all obligations of ENE under the subject contract, and 
no event of default under the subject agreement would exist or result (whether an event of default would exist requires facts on a specific deal so covenants and other contract terms can be tested). 

To the extent that other groups reported to me differences from the typical provisions set forth above, I forwarded them onto to you.

Subject:	Re: FW: ENE/ENA Change of Ownership Diligence Inquiry

In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

Linda,

As we discussed, Enron Corp. was served with a subpoena by the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce documents related to Texon Energy Corporation, of Las Vegas, Nevada, and Lonestar Petroleum Corporation, also of Las Vegas, Nevada  (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).  We have been requested to produce all documents that Enron has related to these entities.  The specific requests are:

1.	All documents concerning Texon including but not limited to agreements or contracts between Enron and Texon, purchase orders, invoices, and correspondence concerning any technical, professional, or other services.

2.	All documents concerning Lonestar including but not limited to agreements or contracts between Enron and Lonestar, purchase orders, invoices, and correspondence concerning any technical, professional, or other services.

The subpoena has a return date of October 5, 2001.  While it is likely that we can get an extension of this return date, I would like to find out whether we think we have any responsive documents before that deadline.  I appreciate your help in sending this information and request out to EWS legal.  Please have responses sent to either me or you by e-mail, by noon on October 4, 2001.  I also understand that you will have someone begin a search of EWS databases for references to these two entities.

Thanks.

A few more details ................   Again, most of the EGA companies' ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities.  Through further research, we found a few more that don't totally fit that mold:
 
Elektro - Electricidad e Servicos S.A. in Brazil  .... 38% of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities.
EPE - Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris S/C Ltda. a.k.a. Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a 1% direct ownership interest and one Board vote.
Energia Ltd, another Brazil operation, is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp.   (Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of 22 Feb. 01.
 
Again, this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know.

Steve:
 
As stated earlier, many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership.
 
We can assure you that, for the most part, you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket (i.e., Corp., ENA, EES, etc.).  There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:
 
EA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)
                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)
 
EBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)
 
EEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.
                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  
 
EES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity
                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies
 
EGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with 
                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have
                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.
                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:
                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA
                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)
                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity
                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.
 
EIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM 
                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited
                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)
 
ENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company
 
EWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the 
                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; 
                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.
 
GLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.
 EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership
                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      
                    
Again, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.  Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance.

"Associate / Analyst Program","
After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

To:	Whalley, Greg; Frevert, Mark; Taylor, Liz
Subject:	Going Down Deep to Get to the Bottom to stay on Top


Well our ""Administration"" feels a lot more like a liquidation.  I am not sure how much longer I will have access
to Enron House in London.  They shut off my outgoing calls on my cell phone yesterday but our email still works. 
They are totally focused on preserving value for our creditors and will spend little resource on protecting Enron
or Directors of Enron companies outside of EEL.  Michael and I are still trying to work these other issues
on Enron's behalf. 

Two critical things that Michael is working on:
*  Working with the regulators on an orderly windown of our business.  This is a challenge because PWC's
   initial take on the situation is to nominate everything at zero.
*  Getting an agreement in place to have some Enron corp people get access to the building and files so
    that we can work on other Enron companies and issues that do not fall under the EEL umbrella.  But
    they have the keys to the building and they hit pretty fast.  For example to save paper, they have now
    shut off all the printers.  We are using Jim Hughes as the focal point for this.  And here the major
    contact besides Michael is Eric Shaw at 3

So anyway here is how you can get ahold of me if our normal Enron communications break down further:

FYI

my home number is 01732-832-807
email address LSherriff'btinternet.com
home cell number is 07811454933

And Michael's home number is 011-44-1582-760-140

Calpine Corp. Becomes One of the Few Companies to Penetrate Florida's Wholesale Market



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from Reuters] San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Corp. (NYSE: CPN) announced that it has begun construction of its planned 530-MW Osprey power plant in Auburndale, Fla. The plant, known as the Osprey Energy Center, is expected to begin commercial operation in late 2003, according to company statements. Calpine said in June that it had received Florida's regulatory approval for the plant, and that it was expected to cost $250 million to build. Calpine also said that it is ""continuing to move forward"" with the proposed 1,080-MW Blue Heron Energy Center, slated for Indian River County, Fla. 

Analysis: With the onset of construction on this plant, Calpine now reportedly ranks as one of the few out-of-state generating companies that has been able to penetrate Florida's wholesale power market. Other companies such as Enron have made similar attempts to begin construction on new plants (or gain control over existing plants), only to be blocked by community and regulatory resistance. Calpine, which now ranks as the largest builder of power plants in North America, has gained entry into Florida by agreeing to sell the output from the plant to one of Florida's existing utilities. Nevertheless, it is a concession that supports Calpine's larger strategy for expansion, both within Florida and across the United States. Along with the Osprey and Blue Heron facilities, Calpine also plans to eventually build a 1,080-MW, $500-million plant near Vero Beach, Fla., which certainly positions the company as the leading out-of-state generator in Florida's rather cloistered wholesale market. 

It is important to note that the Osprey Energy Center, which will be a combined-cycle, natural gas-fired facility, will be the first power plant of its kind to be built by an independent power producer (IPP) in Florida under the state's stringent Power Plant Siting Act. There are some fundamental aspects of Florida's $13-billion electric market that should be established for context. First, Florida represents the third-largest electric market in the United States in terms of consumption (193 million megawatt-hours, according to the Energy Information Administration), so deregulation of the state remains of great importance to many stakeholders. However, Florida has taken a ""go slow"" approach toward electric competition and, at this point, there is no plan to initiate retail competition in Florida. Leaders of the state (including Gov. Jeb Bush) have supported competition in the state's wholesale market in an effort to move cautiously toward total deregulation. Florida's Energy 2020 Study Commission, which is preparing the blueprint for competition in the state, endorsed a plan to allow out-of-state companies to enter Florida's wholesale market by building new plants and selling power to the state's incumbent utilities. 

However, the Florida Supreme Court has banned out-of-state companies from building merchant plants in the state, which would be free to sell power anywhere and are not subject to rate regulation by the state's regulatory commission. A good example of this is Enron, which has attempted several times to build new generation facilities in the state. A proposed plant in Pompano Beach, Fla., was rejected amid strong community resistance. Enron was given governmental approval to proceed with a peaking unit in Deerfield Beach, Fla., for which the company is still attempting to obtain air quality permits. According to Enron, the Deerfield Beach plant was approved because it was classified as a peaking unit, and will be allowed to generate only during times of peak demand. It is not known at this time if Enron will continue with its plans to build this plant now that it is being acquired by Dynegy Inc. Southern Company has also moved into Florida (its first expansion outside of its service area) after receiving preliminary approval to build a 633-MW natural-gas generation facility in Orlando. Southern Company has agreed to sell the total output from this plant in a 10-year contract with the Orlando Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority and Florida Municipal Power Agency. 

Nevertheless, the important point is that Florida has been a notoriously difficult state for outside generating companies to enter and obtain permission to build new generating facilities. Florida law does allow out-of-state companies to build peaker plants, as long as they only operate in times of especially high demand when normal supplies are strained. Some new plants are small enough as to not need approval from the Florida Public Service Commission, although they still must obtain approval related to zoning laws and air pollution permits. One proposal under the 2020 plan has suggested eliminating the involvement of the governor and the State Cabinet in approving proposed plants, and limiting the ability of local governments to block projects. 

There are two factors that enabled Calpine to gain approval to proceed with the Osprey plant. First, Calpine seemingly has signed a long-term contract to sell the output of the plant to Seminole Electric Cooperative under a long-term contract, which meets the Supreme Court standard that out-of-state generators cannot build merchant plants. Second, Seminole is a public utility and outside of the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service Commission, which presumably made it easier for Calpine to gain access into the state. Seminole Electric is a generation and transmission cooperative headquartered in Tampa, Fla. It provides bulk supplies of electricity and wholesale energy services to 10 cooperatives located throughout peninsular Florida. As of December 2000, more than 1.5 million business and residential consumers in 45 counties received electric service from Seminole and its members. According to information from Seminole, the bulk of its generating reserves is provided through a 20-year agreement with Calpine, which runs through 2013. Additional terms of the contract were not disclosed. 

The Osprey facility will be located next to Calpine's existing 150-MW cogeneration facility in Auburndale, Fla., where a new 115-MW simple-cycle peaking unit is also under construction and expected to come online next year. Regarding the planned 1,080-MW plant near Vero Beach, Fla. Calpine reportedly has found buyers for about one-half of the power it would produce from the plant, enough to obtain the necessary state permits. This plant could be under construction by the end of next year. Calpine also opened a Tampa office in 2000 to support its expansion in Florida and the Southeast, which indicates that the company intends to remain a major player in this region, which has been comparatively slow to embrace electric deregulation. 

Further, Calpine participates in a group known as the Florida Partnership for Affordable Competitive Electricity (Florida PACE), which has attempted to persuade lawmakers in the state, including Gov. Jeb Bush, to deregulate Florida's wholesale market. One measure that would help to give the state a competitive kick start, or so says the group, would be to allow companies to build new power plants and resell the electricity to retail power sellers such as Florida Power & Light. A final report from the Florida Energy 2020 commission, which should address some of these issues, is expected Dec. 1. 

Ironically, public resistance to new power plants in Florida comes at a time when new reports suggest that the state faces an imminent power supply problem. According to representatives from the state's Energy 2020 Study Commission, Florida's electric reserve is significantly less than the 16-percent reserve that incumbent utilities have claimed exists. In fact, the commission has found that, ""without extraordinary management techniques including power disruption,"" Florida's reserve is 7 percent. It is important to note that the commission is not including interruptible loads in its reserve calculations. If interruptible load is considered, then Florida most likely does have a roughly 16-percent electric reserve. Thus, Florida's policy of requiring out-of-state generators to sign long-term contracts with incumbent retailers could be considered a very prudent move, as any new generation that gets developed in the state is committed to a retail provider (reducing the possibility that power could be withheld to drive up market prices). 

As a whole, Calpine has a generation arsenal that includes some 37,700-MW baseload capacity of mostly natural gas-fired and renewable geothermal resources. In addition to the baseload generation, Calpine also owns or controls about 8,000 MW of peaking capacity that is presently in operation. Peaking units generally operate in times of especially high demand when normal supplies are strained. 

As the leading builder of power plants in North America, Calpine is one of a small number of generating companies that have banked on a steady increase in demand across the United States, along with the need to supply power during periods of peak demand. Other companies competing against Calpine in this space include Reliant Energy, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy, which collectively have reportedly announced plans to build some 422,000 MW of generating capacity over the next 13 years. Calpine specifically has acknowledged that it will buy 27 steam engines from Siemens AG between 2002 and 2005 to build 5,400 MW of generating capacity. 

Many of these plans for new generating facilities were outlined over the last year or two, when the United States faced a well-publicized energy crunch. Now, the pendulum has swung back to leave many of the same companies worried about a possible energy glut in which they will have excess power that cannot be sold (or sold at lower-than-anticipated prices). Certainly, a large portion of the generation planned while supply was compromised and prices were high will be canceled or delayed. However, as one example, Calpine appears to be following through with an aggressive generation expansion strategy. One approach that might help Calpine to beat the odds against an energy glut is that the company continues to build generation in markets that are projected to have continually increasing demand. However, from a broad perspective, Calpine may find that, as other companies continue with plans for generation facilities that may have progressed too far to be terminated, the surplus of supply could have an impact on prices, which could in turn impact the market as a whole.

Regulators Seek More Data About Credit Derivatives
Dow Jones Newswire

WASHINGTON-U.S. bank regulators, saying the notional amount of credit
derivatives at banks has increased more than sixfold since 1997, from $55
billion to $352 billion, are proposing new reporting requirements on credit
derivatives.

The requirements focus on what are known as bank call reports, which banks
file with the federal bank regulatory agencies each quarter; these are used
to monitor the condition and risk profile of reporting banks and the
industry as a whole.

In a joint notice, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said tile new Items proposed to
be added to call reports should result in a ""minimal additional reporting
burden"" for affected banks.
 
WORLD NEWS: Brazil's weakness set 'for some time'
Financial Times; Oct 19, 2001
By Raymond Colitt in Sao Paulo


Brazil's financial markets have recovered this week, halting at least
temporarily the downward spiral of the Real. But few analysts support the
government's hopes of asustained currency recovery that would allow interest
rates to come down and economic growth to resume. 

With a tighter monetary policy and somewhat brighter short-term prospects
after elections in neighbouring Argentina, the Brazilian portion of the JP
Morgan's EMBI+, emerging markets bond index, has narrowed by 133 basis
points since October 8. 

By mid-week, the Real had recovered to RDollars 2.70, up 4.5 per cent
against the dollar from its post-attack low. Future interest rates also came
down by more than 60 basis points this week. 

The Real had depreciated 30 per cent against the dollar since the beginning
of the year, raising concerns about the country's inflation target and
credit outlook. 

However, the currency weakness ""is here to stay"", says Marcelo Carvalho,
chief economist with JP Morgan Chase, the investment bank, in Sao Paulo.
""The fundamental problems of the Brazilian economy have not changed and the
market outlook remains uncertain."" 

Indeed, a consensus forecast published by the central bank sees the currency
at RDollars 2.80 against the dollar at the end of this year and at RDollars
2.86 by the end of next year. A sustained currency weakness implies higher
inflation and a larger nominal budget deficit, and subsequently slower
economic growth, says Mr Carvalho. JP Morgan Chase foresees GDP growth next
year of only 1 per cent, compared to the market consensus of 2.25 per cent
next year. 

Brazil's principal problem is its dependence on international capital
markets and direct foreign investment to finance a current account deficit
estimated at USDollars 25bn this year, the largest of any emerging market. 

Total external financing requirements are estimated at just under USDollars
50bn next year, a tall order at a time of a global downturn and heightened
risk aversion towards emerging markets. 

Earlier this month, the economic authorities issued more dollar-linked debt,
increased obligatory bank deposits and reformed corporate reporting rules
designed to reduce the need for currency hedging. 

The economic slowdown these measures helped to trigger will help improve the
country's trade balance by driving down imports. As a result, the market
expects the current account deficit to fall from Dollars 25bn this year to
Dollars 21.7bn next year. The domestic slowdown has also helped to dampen
inflationary pressure caused by the currency depreciation. 

On Wednesday, the central bank decided to maintain its prime interest rate
at 19 per cent with a neutral bias. Yet more action to tighten monetary
policy - such as a further increase of bank deposit requirements - may be
necessary given the ongoing threat of an Argentine default, an escalation of
the US-led war on terrorism and political noise ahead of Brazil's
presidential elections next year.
	 
Bank of New York demands back-up links from customers
By Joshua Chaffin in New York

The Bank of New York will require some customers to have back-up
communications links to its securities processing operations, and will more
closely inspect its vendors' technology and communications capabilities to
ensure they function in the event of disaster. 

Thomas Renyi, chief executive, announced the changes on Thursday when
discussing the bank's third quarter earnings, which suffered more than
expected from the September 11 attacks. 

BoNY, which specialises in securities processing, was one of the Wall Street
firms hardest hit by the attacks. More than a month later, it is still
struggling to reconcile trades that clients executed after September 11. 

As a result, its disaster recovery plans have been among the most
scrutinised by the financial services industry as it tries to prepare for
future disasters. 

BoNY executives had contended that much of the disruption was due to damaged
telecommunications lines. 

Mr Renyi reiterated Wall Street's new-found appreciation of ""how important
telecommunications are to the smooth operation of the capital markets"". 

But he also pointed to problems with computer and communications systems at
BoNY's vendors that may have hindered the bank's recovery. 

""Some of the things just didn't work as billed by our vendors,"" he said. 

Mr Renyi also said that he and other Wall Street executives would
re-evaluate the practice of out-sourcing large volumes of business to a
small number of companies. 

His comments are notable because BoNY has aggressively promoted itself to
customers as a single provider for all back-office needs, from trade
processing to accounting. 

Overall, losses from the disaster cut BoNY's third-quarter earnings by
one-third from last year's levels to $243m, or 33 cents a share. BoNY
pointed out that excluding the disaster, earnings rose 6 per cent from last
year. 

BoNY recorded a $140m charge related to the disaster. This covers a variety
of expenses, from renting office space in mid-town Manhattan to buying
computers. 
BoNY estimated it lost about $29m in fees from the closure of the markets
and problems with its automatic teller machines, and paid about $45m to
compensate customers for trades that failed or were slow. 

However, it expected that a ""substantial amount"" would be covered by
insurance.

	 
DTCC seeks to address post Sept 11op-risk concerns 
By Gallagher Polyn

18 October - The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world's
largest clearing company, has seized the initiative to address the issue of
systemic operational risk concerns raised in the aftermath of the US
terrorist attacks of September 11. 

DTCC chairman and chief executive Jill Considine held the first in a series
of discussions with representatives of the Securities Exchange Commission,
the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
yesterday, to address operational risks exposed by the attacks on the World
Trade Center. 

In a speech to the Bond Market Association in New York prior to the meeting,
Considine said the major systemic risk posed by the September 11 attack
stemmed from over-centralisation of physical assets - people and facilities
- related to financial markets in New York. Bond market settlement banks,
the New York telephone carrier Verizon's network in lower Manhattan, and
numerous market makers on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq were
briefly incapacitated by the attack. US fixed-income markets did not resume
trading until September 14, while trading on NYSE and Nasdaq did not resume
until September 17. 

The Bank of New York, a large custodian and securities settlement bank, had
major problems paying out funds due to failed communications lines, with
some market sources indicating that Bank of New York's payments backlog
reached $130 billion on Thursday September 13, leaving a number of large
European institutions with large overdrafts with other banks. 

After a 'breather' from weeks of intensive recovery efforts by US regulatory
authorities subsequent to the attack, Considine said the DTCC would look to
take a leadership role in helping the US financial industry adopt new best
practices to manage the newly exposed risks. 

Comments made by Considine during her speech suggested the DTCC would hold
discussions with regulators, broker-dealers, electronic trading network
service providers, clearing houses, and even public utilities like phone
companies. 

Asked whether new awareness of the risks stemming from spatial concentration
would result in calls to disperse financial market operations over wider
areas, Considine said, ""I think people are looking at that very seriously.""
But it was unclear whether Considine was referring to regulatory
authorities. Neither the SEC nor the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have
yet issued any new regulations related to the attacks, though impact
assessment is ongoing, spokespersons for the two organisations said. 

The DTCC is the world's largest post-trade infrastructure organisation,
providing clearance, settlement and custody services for equities, corporate
and municipal debt, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, ADRs, money market
instruments, unit investment trusts and insurance products.

My move to the finance/ M&A group was intended to provide a greater exposure to Enron's other businesses, which it has, but it would not be correct to characterize  my experience with reference only to  my current assignment. My resume does, of course , provide these details but I would not want to be  incorrectly ""labeled"". I am also willing to help out in any way during the transition regardless of the group to which  I am currently assigned , so please do not hesitate to call on me. Nancy

No, we have not heard from the Office again.  Word has it that the Minister will soon be relieved of his duties, and hopefully the whole issue will be buried.   I will keep you posted.

A Diretoria Colegiada do Banco Central do Brasil, em sess?o

Art. 2? Para efeito do disposto nesta circular, s?o definidos como:

transferidora e a contraparte receptora do risco de cr?dito para liquida??o
em data futura, que impliquem, na ocorr?ncia de um ou mais eventos de
deteriora??o da qualidade do cr?dito, na recomposi??o, total ou parcial, do
valor do ativo subjacente pela contraparte receptora em favor da contraparte
transferidora do risco;
II - eventos de deteriora??o da qualidade de cr?dito (eventos de cr?dito):
aqueles fatos que, independentemente da sua motiva??o, caracterizem-se por:
a)	decreta??o de fal?ncia dos obrigados do ativo subjacente;
b)	pedido de concordata preventiva dos obrigados do ativo

agosto de 1994, e altera??es posteriores, em fun??o do grau de transfer?ncia
do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente.
? 1? Para efeito do disposto neste artigo, considera-se efetiva a
transfer?ncia do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente, com a poss?vel
redu??o do fator de pondera??o a ele aplic?vel, quando:
I - o contrato estabelecer como eventos de cr?dito, no m?nimo, a ocorr?ncia
individual ou conjunta das situa??es previstas no art. 2?, inciso II;
II - o ativo subjacente for legalmente pass?vel de transfer?ncia, nos casos
em que o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito assim o preveja na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito;
III - a contraparte transferidora do risco n?o retiver risco de cr?dito sob
qualquer forma;
IV - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite o cancelamento unilateral
do contrato pela contraparte receptora do risco de cr?dito, exceto na
hip?tese do n?o pagamento pela contraparte transferidora da remunera??o
estabelecida no art. 1?, incisos I e II;
V - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite, ? contraparte receptora do
risco de cr?dito, o n?o cumprimento da obriga??o de efetuar prontamente o
pagamento do montante devido ? contraparte transferidora na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito.
? 2? O fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, a ser aplicado ao montante
de prote??o do ativo subjacente para fins de apura??o do PLE deve ser obtido
com base na seguinte f?rmula:
FP = (1 - F) x (PRP x 50)/PRA + [1- (PRP/PRA)] x FPA + F x FPA, onde:
FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo
subjacente;
PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);
PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);
FPA = Fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, relativo ao ativo
subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o
art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e
altera??es posteriores;
F = ""zero"" nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser contratado na mesma
moeda que o ativo subjacente;
F = 0,50 (cinq?enta cent?simos) nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser
contratado em outra moeda que n?o a do ativo subjacente.
? 3? A exposi??o ao risco do ativo subjacente que exceder o montante
de prote??o deve ser ponderada pelo seu fator original conforme a Tabela de
Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo
IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e altera??es posteriores.
? 4? Na hip?tese em que estipulada cl?usula relativa a valores ou
percentuais m?nimos de perda do ativo subjacente para que a recomposi??o,
total ou parcial, seja efetuada, deve ser comprovada parcela adicional de
PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.
Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do
ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.
Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco
garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em
esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco
decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele
aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele
aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es
financeiras, de informa??es contendo, pelo menos, os seguintes aspectos
relativos ?s opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito:
I - pol?tica, objetivos e estrat?gias da institui??o;
II - processo de gerenciamento de riscos;
III - volumes de risco de cr?dito transferidos (valor cont?bil e de
mercado), total e no per?odo;
IV - receitas e/ou despesas no per?odo;
V - efeito (aumento/redu??o) no c?lculo do PLE;
VI - montante e caracter?sticas das opera??es de cr?ditos
transferidas ou recebidas no per?odo em decorr?ncia dos fatos geradores
previstos no contrato;
VII - segrega??o por tipo (swap de cr?dito e swap de taxa de retorno total).
Art. 6? O Banco Central do Brasil poder? determinar o aumento do PLE, com
base em caracter?sticas intr?nsecas ao contrato.
Art. 7? As institui??es devem manter, ? disposi??o do Banco Central
do Brasil, adequadamente documentadas, sua pol?tica e procedimentos para
realiza??o de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, bem como os limites de
exposi??o estabelecidos, independentemente da condi??o de receptora ou
transferidora do risco.
Art. 8? Fica condicionada ? autoriza??o do Banco Central do Brasil a
celebra??o de contrato de derivativo de cr?dito cujo montante seja igual ou
superior a 10% (dez por cento) valor do Patrim?nio de Refer?ncia (PR) da
institui??o que atuar como contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 9? A institui??o deve informar ao Departamento de Cadastro e
Informa??es do Sistema financeiro (Decad) o nome do diretor respons?vel pela
pr?tica de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, nos termos do art. 3? da
Resolu??o de de 2001.

"RE: Applications","Commercial Risk Reinsurance is very well known and reputable, according to
the BoA insurance portfolio manager.
We do see ACA a lot through our muni derivatives business.  They will insure
lower rated credits (A- to BBB-, and some below that) who are seeking an A
rating but do not want to pay for a AAA rating.  Should be fine from our
standpoint.

"In re F&J Representation/Urgent","
		
	We are close to making a decision on whether to use F&J or some other firm for a new Mariner matter.  I anticipate that if we retain some other firm besides F&J, F&J may want to give us our files back, per the original Gus Blackshear letter to Jim.  Of course, F&J will insist in giving back one of Mark's files under any circumstance.  Put aside for a moment the problematic ethical issue that I believe that raises for F&J and whether we would pursue F&J for taking such an action. If F&J sends our files back, can we live with that in the cases/matters you are handling?  

	For Mark, Jordan and Theresa, I of course already have Theresa's voice-mail regarding the new Mariner matter, and have (along with Jim) spoken with Scott Josie.  I also have an urgent call in for Kelly Zelacovitz.

	If there is anyone else you think I should include in this e-mail, please let me know.

	Please reply ASAP.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Argentina's Cavallo Insists The Peso Won't Be Devalued
The Wall Street Journal - November 16, 2001
By David Luhnow and Michelle Wallin

If Argentina's financial crisis gets much worse, the country would adopt the
dollar or euro as its official currency rather than allow the Argentine peso
to devalue and trade freely on the open market, Argentine economy minister
Domingo Cavallo said Thursday.

In an interview, the architect of Argentina's decade-old monetary regime,
under which one peso equals one dollar, said Argentines accustomed to a
stable currency would never accept a peso floating freely on the open market
-- the policy adopted under past financial crises by Latin America's two
largest economies, Brazil and Mexico.

""The peso would be repudiated, just as the austral once was,"" said Mr.
Cavallo, referring to Argentina's doomed former currency. ""So the peso only
makes sense, will only continue to exist, if it's backed by dollars and at a
one-to-one parity"" or linked both to the dollar and euro, he said.

""For this reason, we maintain that in extreme circumstances, it's much more
logical to say, 'We'll only use the dollar' or 'We'll only use euros,' or
another credible currency,"" he said.

Read the full text of an exclusive interview with Argentine Economy Minister
Domingo Cavallo.  As Argentina endures its fourth year of an economic slump,
which Mr. Cavallo described as a ""depression,"" local union leaders and some
foreign economists have called for policymakers to let the peso devalue,
making Argentine goods less expensive abroad. But with 70% of bank accounts
in dollars, along with most contracts like rental agreements, undoing such
de facto dollarization would be impossible to implement or enforce, Mr.
Cavallo said.

The Harvard-educated economist insisted, ""Argentina will never give up
convertibility,"" which allows both currencies to exist side by side. But
Argentines don't necessarily believe that: They have pulled nearly $13
billion out of the country's banks so far this year. That has left the
central bank with only about $6 billion of hard-currency reserves in excess
of the money in circulation. If that cushion were to disappear, then the
system would be sorely tested.

Once hailed as the engineer of an Argentine economic miracle in the early
1990s that ended decades of runaway price increases, Mr. Cavallo, 55 years
old, has come under fire during his second tenure, which began in March
after the first two economy ministers under President Fernando de la Rua
quit.

Although Mr. Cavallo inherited an economy mired in a long recession, he has
been unable to generate growth. Meantime, creditors have demanded
ever-higher interest rates to lend to the country. Argentina finally
admitted this month it can't pay its growing interest bill, asking lenders
at home and abroad to take huge write-offs on as much as $60 billion in
bonds. The country is weighed down by overall debt of $132 billion.

But the man at the center of the storm, famous for his temper, looked
relaxed and confident Thursday after clinching a long-awaited deal with
opposition governors of Argentina's biggest provinces to carry out big
spending cuts, saving the federal government some $2.3 billion a year in tax
transfers. The deal is key for Argentina to convince creditors like the
International Monetary Fund the country will balance its books for the rest
of this year and next.

""This ratifies that in Argentina our elected officials are, in the end,
coming together to resolve problems,"" he said.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who has opposed fresh financial aid
for Argentina, gave the country a vote of confidence Thursday, saying the
situation has become ""quite encouraging."" He praised President de la Rua for
personally getting involved in negotiations to lower interest payments on
Argentine debt. ""He's not crying for huge volumes of new additional money.
He's saying we, the people of Argentina, led by the president, are going to
figure this out and create sustainable conditions,"" Mr. O'Neill said.

Messrs. O'Neill and Cavallo will meet today to discuss the country's debt
crisis, which some ratings agencies have labeled a default, and ways to get
Argentina's economy going again.

Argentina's current plan -- to get investors to exchange their current bonds
for ones that pay less interest -- could hit legal problems if foreign
creditors decide Argentina hasn't provided enough guarantees of repayment
and is favoring local investors over foreign bondholders. Mr. Cavallo said
that won't be the case.

""The offer [for foreigners] will have terms that are very equitable compared
with what we are offering Argentine investors,"" he said. The offer to local
investors would exchange bonds paying an average 11% interest for new notes
paying no more than 7% but will have what Argentina claims are better
guarantees since the notes will be backed by tax revenues.

Local banks and pension funds have until next Friday to complete the deal,
Mr. Cavallo said. Details of the offer for foreign creditors are expected in
the next few months.

Separately, Mr. Cavallo said Argentina will end the year with a federal
budget deficit of no more than $7.5 billion. If bondholders agree to take
the debt exchange on offer, he added, then the deficit could come closer to
the $6.5 billion promised to the IMF at the start of this year.

For next year, Mr. Cavallo pledged a balanced budget. He said the government
plans to cut spending by $3 billion in addition to the $2.3 billion it
expects to save from lower tax transfers to the provinces. If the government
saves $4 billion from restructuring its debt, as it also expects, the total
$9.3 billion in savings should more than cover any shortfall in revenues,
even if the economy were to remain sluggish, he said.


Basel II Accord in danger of failing, says German banker 
Risk News - November 16, 2001
By David Keefe
 
16 November - The Basel II bank capital Accord is in real danger of failing
unless clear solutions are found to several open questions about the Accord,
a senior German banker told a conference in London yesterday.

One of the key issues is the way lending to small to medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), known as mittelstand in Germany, could be choked off by
the credit risk capital charges proposed in the Accord, said Wolfgang
Hartmann, member of the managing board of directors at Germany's
Commerzbank. He was speaking at a banking conference organised by the
Financial Times newspaper. 

He noted German Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der has threatened to veto Basel II
unless the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, the architect of Basle
II and the body that regulates international banking, agrees fair
arrangements for SMEs. 

The complex, risk-based Basel II proposals will determine from 2005 what
proportion of their assets large international banks must set aside as
reserve capital to guard against banking risks, including credit and market
risks as well as, for the first time, operational risk. 

Bank lending to SMEs, which Hartmann described as the backbone of German
business, is traditionally long term. Under the current Basel II credit risk
proposals longer-term lending will attract higher capital charges than the
shorter-term lending more customary among banks in other major economies.
That, said the German government and the Bundesbank, could discourage
lending to German SMEs, which often have weak equity bases and are more
dependent on bank borrowing. 

Hartmann said Commerzbank is strongly committed to SMEs and has a large
number of customers among them. 

""Clearly, Basel II must come up with an answer to the political issues if it
does not want to endanger the overall acceptance of its rules,"" he said. 

Basel II will also fail if a respectable number of international banks do
not develop a track record for the different internal ratings based (IRB)
approaches to calculating credit risk capital charges under the Accord,
Hartmann said. 

Commerzbank's goal for 2005 is to obtain certification for the IRB
foundation approach, while starting to collect necessary data for the more
complex IRB advanced approach. That would enable Commerzbank to switch to
the advanced approach as soon as possible, Hartmann said. But Hartmann said
the incentives to progress beyond the standardised approach, the simplest of
the three methods of calculating credit risk charges under Basel II, were
not strong enough and must be changed. 

He said the current caps on the two IRB approaches would limit the benefits
to banks of using these more complex methods, adding that he hoped the new
calibration of risk weights promised by the regulators would meet this
requirement. 

Hartmann said the Basel Committee's paper on potential modifications to the
Basel II proposals issued earlier this month was a step in the right
direction. 

The Basel Committee hopes to issue its third consultative paper on Basel II
in late February next year, and publish the final version of the Accord by
the end of 2002. 

Basel is intended in the first instance for international banks of the Group
of l0 leading economies, but is designed for banks of all sizes. Basel I,
the current bank capital adequacy Accord that dates from 1988, was later
adopted by more than 100 countries. 

The European Union intends applying capital adequacy rules closely modelled
on Basel II to all banks and investment firms in the 15-nation EU from 2005.

"In re F&J Representation","
	This follows up on my voice-mail to you of just a few minutes ago.  I reviewed a voice-mail from Theresa Bushman this morning about the timing on the new Mariner matter that Mariner for which Mariner would like to retain F&J.  She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions.  Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date.  Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.

	I see two options:

	1.  If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is:  I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today.  If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today.   Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.

	2.  If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.

	Caveat:  I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly.  Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.  

	I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.

	If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.

	I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do.

	Britt

Email correspondence has been exchanged concerning support letters for EES companies in the UK, but the issue impacts all UK companies and also (given minor differences in legal regimes) those in all other European jurisdictions. 

Hopefully the conclusion now is that Corp feels able to give the standard support letters, and the additional comfort referred to in my note below. The consequences of Corp not being able to are fairly dire. 

Thanks.

Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

   Subject:    Credit Derivatives Issue
   
   You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate
   in the
   credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in
   the UK.
   ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a
   statement
   regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others
   are
   either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not
   issue
   a statement. 
    
   Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of
   convertible
   bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred.
   What
   is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of ""Not
   Contingent"" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic
   typically
   required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires
   that the
   payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
   contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at
   the
   option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the
   option of
   the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to
   exercise
   the conversion (sometimes referred to as a ""widows and orphans""
   clause) is a
   standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
   bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their
   conversion
   right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do
   so. In
   the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
   beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the
   trustee
   to convert exists.
    
   A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
   Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
   review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form,
   the
   User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published
   in the
   next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by
   the
   ""group of six"" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents,
   we
   suggest that ""plain vanilla"" convertible bonds should satisfy the
   ""Not
   Contingent"" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable.
   ""Plain
   vanilla"" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where
   conversion
   is at the option of the holder of the trustee.
    
   A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA
   meeting) is
   scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything
   prior
   to that meeting.
    
   I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any
   statement
   regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their
   views
   on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are
   also
   discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters
   how we
   might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share
   your
   views with the other addressees of this email, as they are
   coordinating the
   views of members.

"In re F&J Representation","
	By telefax of November 21, Uriel Dutton of F&J provided a proposed waiver letter agreement for our review.  I will have copies of that proposed agreement circulated by hand-delivery and fax to all those on this list and to Mariner's GC.  At present,  I am not sending this e-mail to Mariner's GC. If there is someone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.  

	Chuck and I have reviewed the letter, believe it to be overly broad, and hope that F&J is willing to negotiate further, along the following lines:

	1.  On page 1, third full paragraph, second line, we suggest inserting ""Enron Corp. and "" between ""representation of"" and ""Enron's affiliates"".

	2.  On page 4, paragraph (4), we are concerned about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  ""Enron Corp. agrees that it will cause each existing or future affiliate of Enron Corp. to comply with the agreements of the Enron Entities herein set forth.""  We think, although we do not know for sure, that F&J's concern is that F&J may become adverse in the future to some existing Enron entity that F&J does not currently represent,  or that does not currently exist, and that either of these two entities may seek to assert disqualification based on F&J's current representation of Enron entities.  If this is the reason for the sentence, we don't see how an existing Enron entity or future Enron entity could assert a conflict that has been waived by the Enron entity that is actually being represented.

	      We also have a concern about asking Enron Corp. to cause all of its ""affiliates"", as defined in the letter agreement, to comply with it.  Enron Corp. may not have the power to require all its ""affiliates"" to comply.  Our suggestion would be that this letter agreement be signed on behalf of all the actual Enron entities currently represented by F&J, including Mariner.

	 3.  On page 4, 17 lines from the top, we find objectionable the language that begins, ""Without limiting the foregoing...""  It seems to us that here, F&J wants all the Enron companies to be considered separately for disqualification purposes, and perhaps to be able to sue one Enron entity even though F&J is representing another Enron entity in a substantially related matter.

	3. On pages 4-5, paragraph (5), we have a concern about the third sentence, which reads as follows:  ""If Dynegy declines or fails to do so promptly after receipt of our request, it is expressly agreed and understood that F&J shall be entitled...""  Our concern is that we are committing Enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what Dynegy may or may not do.  Our suggestion would be that we simply ask F&J to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph (5).

	4.  Please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement, we are not requiring F&J to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for, e.g., the Licensing Project or the asbestosis cases (in the event that Enron Corp. cannot be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial).  We do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something F&J will agree to if we need F&J to take on the new Mariner matter.  Mariner's GC called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether F&J was going to be able to represent Mariner on a new, critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than December 27; otherwise, she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter.

	Please let us have your comments as soon as possible.

	Britt

Chevron and Texaco Complete Merger, 
Creating Second Largest U.S. Energy Company 



By Christopher Perdue
Director, Market Research 


[News item from PR Newswire] Chevron Corp. announced today that stockholders have voted to approve the proposed merger with Texaco. The votes were cast at a special stockholder meeting. More than 441 million shares, 99 percent of the shares voted, approved the common stock issuance, and more than 438 million shares, 68 percent of the shares entitled to vote, approved the name change to ChevronTexaco Corporation. The companies intend to close the merger later today. 

Analysis: While the energy market has seen many deals this year, nothing matches the colossus created by this merger. The combination of San Francisco-based Chevron (NYSE: CHV) and White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco (NYSE:TX) creates a company with annual revenues of over $96 billion. In terms of market capitalization, the new company will rank second among U.S. energy companies with only Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) being larger. 

Chevron agreed to buy Texaco last October in a stock deal valued at approximately $39.3 billion, plus the assumption of about $6 billion in debt. Under the terms of the deal, Texaco shareholders receive .77 shares of Chevron common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron shareholders will retain their existing shares. Chevron will be renamed ChevronTexaco and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol CVX. Next year, the new company will place its headquarters in suburban San Ramon, Calif. 

The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and operations throughout the world. In the United States, ChevronTexaco will be the nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1 million BOE per day, and will hold the nation's third largest reserve position, with 4.2 billion BOE of proven reserves. 

The approval from shareholders represents the final hurdle to the merger. European regulators have already granted approval, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted 4-0 to approve the merger last month. Chevron and Texaco also recently negotiated a consent decree with the attorneys general of 12 states. 

To satisfy the FTC's apprehension that the merger, as initially proposed, would violate antitrust law, Texaco agreed to divest its U.S. refining and marketing affiliates. 

Texaco refines crude oil in the United States under two separate affiliates, Equilon Enterprises and Motiva Enterprises. The company owns a 44-percent interest in Equilon, with the remainder belonging to Shell. Texaco and Saudi Refining each own 35 percent of Motiva. The rest is owned by Shell. 

In addition, Texaco will sell its one-third interest in the Discovery natural-gas pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico and its general aviation businesses in 14 states. 

Although Texaco and Chevron have been rivals, the two companies have a long business relationship. For the past 65 years, they have co-owned a prosperous joint venture called Caltex, which sells 1.8 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products per day with operations in 60 countries. Caltex refines crude oil and marketing petroleum products, LNG and gas products with a workforce of more than 6,000. Revenues for the company and its affiliates were $20.2 billion in 2000. 

This merger appears to be a good fit for many reasons. One benefit is that the two companies have many complementary operations internationally, including West Africa and Brazil, home to some of the world's largest new oil fields. 

The new company will have a leadership position in power generation. Texaco's power and gasification business, with equity interests in 3,500 megawatts of power operating or under construction, and Chevron's 26-percent stake in Dynegy, Inc., will strengthen the company's position in the gasification and power generation markets. 

In addition, the sheer size of the new company should allow it to better cope with fluctuating crude prices and provide a greater ability to undertake global projects that are growing in complexity, size and cost. The stock market attests to these economies of scale. The stock prices for Chevron and Texaco, though up about 50 percent and 60 percent over the past five years, have under-performed those of the gargantuan players like ExxonMobil and BP. After gaining enormous size through mergers in recent years, these two companies have seen their shares return about 70 percent and 80 percent, respectively. 

ExxonMobil and BP have seen their price/earnings multiples command significant premiums as well. Chevron and Texaco currently have price/earnings multiples of about 9.2 and 12.3 respectively, while BP and ExxonMobil command price/earnings multiples of approximately 15.1 and 16.3 respectively. 

These significant stock price premiums that ExxonMobil and BP have obtained after their mergers bode nicely for ChevronTexaco. It now joins the ranks of these major players. As mentioned earlier, in terms of market capitalization, the new company will rank second among U.S. energy companies, and fourth among global energy companies, with a market capitalization approaching $100 billion. 

The new company expects to reduce costs by at least $1.2 billion per year within six to nine months of the merger's completion. The most significant savings (approximately $700 million) are projected to come from more efficient exploration and production activities. An additional $300 million is expected to come from the consolidation of corporate functions, and $200 million from other operations. The company anticipates that the combined workforce of about 57,000 will be reduced by approximately 7 percent worldwide. 

These projected expense reductions of $1.2 billion could be just an initial payoff. Looking at the recent mergers of BP and ExxonMobil, history suggests that the major oil companies underestimate their scope for slashing costs. For example, since the merger of Exxon and Mobil in 1999, savings estimates have been raised by about $1 billion in each of the years 2000 to 2002. In addition, BP has almost doubled initial savings expectations in its various mergers to $4 billion from $2.2 billion. So, it is not inconceivable that the merger could reduce costs perhaps up to twice as much as currently projected, and that would translate into earnings for next year and beyond being much higher than anticipated. 

The creation of ChevronTexaco adds a new player to the oil and gas elite. Rather than being acquired by ExxonMobil Corp., BP Amoco Plc, or Royal Dutch Shell Group, as was becoming more likely with each passing month, Chevron and Texaco became their equal.

Ontario Treads Cautiously Along Its Toilsome Path Toward Deregulation



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis






[News item from Reuters] Ontario, Canada's plan to open its electricity market to competition could happen earlier than the May 2002 target date, but the earlier timing is contingent upon the completion of a key report, a spokesperson for the province's energy minister said earlier this week. ""It's opening. We're just waiting to set a date and full steam ahead,"" said Christine Smith, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Energy, Science and Technology. Ontario's government will make the decision regarding the start date for competition once the readiness report, which documents the preparedness of all the agencies involved in the privatization process, is completed and reviewed by both Energy Minister Jim Wilson and Premier Mike Harris. 

Analysis: The fact that the start of electric competition in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, may actually be on the near horizon is a major development, considering that deregulation in the region has been in the works-and has encountered several delays-since 1998. Shaken by the fiasco of direct access in California, along with the sudden price spikes that occurred in Alberta (Canada's only fully opened market), officials in Ontario have been rather reticent to proceed with dismantling the monopoly system in this region. However, it now appears that Ontario is finally moving forward with its deregulation plan, despite concerns from some of the major players in Canada that officials in the region have orchestrated what may become another troubled experiment in electric deregulation. 

Before discussing the current deregulation plans in Ontario, it is necessary to establish some key points about Canada as a whole, the province of Ontario in particular and trends within the energy market of the Great White North. From a national perspective, electric deregulation in Canada is occurring on a province-by-province basis (much like the United States is deregulating its market on a state-by-state basis). At this point, only Alberta has deregulated its electric market, which occurred in January 2001. Beyond Ontario, none of the other Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, or Yukon) have taken any definitive steps toward deregulating their electric markets and instead are approaching deregulation from a ""wait-and-see"" perspective. Part of this reticence toward deregulation among other Canadian provinces besides Alberta and Ontario relates to the generally low energy prices across Canada and the fact that the regions within the nation are vast and rather isolated from each other (thus making the issue of transmission interconnection a challenge). Ontario is an exception to this general rule, as the province has experienced relatively high prices and is interconnected with other provinces and the United States. 

As noted, Ontario is the most populous Canadian province, the home to 11 million people with an average power usage of 155 terrawatt hours a year, and representing a $10-billion electric market. The three main utilities in Ontario are Ontario Power Generation, the former Crown-owned utility that was formed by the replacement of Ontario Hydro Services Company with separate commercial companies in April 1999 and currently controls a total generating capacity of approximately 25,800 MW; Ottawa Hydro, which is owned by the city of Ottawa; and Toronto Hydro, which was created as a result of the convergence between six utility companies serving Toronto. Toronto Hydro consists of a transmission and distribution unit and an energy services company, but owns no generation of its own. Of the three, Ontario Power Generation has the market share in the province, reportedly serving about 85 percent of Ontario's power market. 

Deregulation of Ontario's natural-gas market took place in the late 1980s. Following plans that had been in the works since at least 1998, electric deregulation in Ontario was originally scheduled to begin in November 2000, although it was postponed another 18 months due to concerns from officials after witnessing the well-documented problems in California. Energy Minister Jim Wilson reportedly was also concerned about Alberta's experience with electric deregulation. Competition in Alberta's wholesale and retail power market began on Jan. 1, 2001, a time at which wholesale prices for natural gas were staggeringly high. High demand and short supply in Alberta caused rates in the province to immediately double upon the onset of deregulation, a development that has naturally given great pause to other Canadian governments. Natural-gas and electricity prices in Alberta have since fallen dramatically, as elsewhere in North America, but not before the Alberta government was forced to give hefty rebates to customers to compensate for the sharp increases. 

Under Ontario's evolving deregulation plan, retail markets will remain under the oversight of the Ontario Energy Board, the provincial power regulator, and are scheduled to open at the same time as wholesale markets. Under the retail system, customers will have the option of arranging their electricity purchases directly from suppliers at fixed-price contracts, or having energy purchased for them by distribution companies, agents, brokers, or marketers at fluctuating prices. Most reports indicate that Ontario is well positioned to open its market to competition, at least from a supply perspective; in fact, Ontario government officials have claimed that the province has adequate power supply, fueled mostly by hydro and nuclear energy, along with planned investments in new generation. However, other observers have claimed that the delay in the start date for competition in Ontario is serving as a deterrent for new generation investments in the region. Reports from earlier in 2001 indicated that Ontario will need an additional 1,000 MW of generation in addition to its existing capacity of 26,000 MW to meet demand, and only one 450-MW plant had been officially announced. 

In addition, despite the assurances from the government, some companies have claimed that the deregulation policy outlined by the Ontario Energy Board is fundamentally uncompetitive. For instance, one company that appears to have very little interest in the new opportunities in Ontario is Calgary-based TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., Canada's largest natural-gas pipeline company and a huge player in the country's regulated marketplace. One of the key criticisms that TransCanada officials have raised is that the Ontario government is implementing a policy in which the bulk of Ontario's high-quality generating assets will remain controlled by Ontario Power Generation, leaving only undesirable plants on the auction block. In other words, even in a deregulated market, Ontario Power Generation may continue to hold the market share of generation in Ontario. TransCanada claims that this approach will diminish investment interest in Ontario and do little to entice new generating companies from entering the province. TransCanada, which has previously made acquisitions of natural-gas fired plants in Alberta and the northeastern United States, does not think that the province will offer a very competitive market and appears to have little interest in moving into the Ontario electric market. Note that in mid-October, Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase the majority of the gas marketing business of TransCanada, making it the largest natural-gas marketer in Canada and the largest natural-gas exporter to the United States. 

Under the Ontario Energy Board's deregulation plan, Ontario Power Generation must sell or lease 4,000 MW of its non-nuclear power within 42 months of the opening of the Ontario market. Currently, Ontario Power Generation owns 9,700 MW of fossil-fuel capacity; 8,728 MW of nuclear power; and 7,309 MW of hydroelectric power. Obviously, the governmental mandate regarding the divestiture leaves the bulk of the province's generating capacity under the control of Ontario Power Generation, which is a major point of contention for potential competitors. 

It is important to note that the office of Ontario Energy Minister Jim Wilson does not share TransCanada's perspective. In fact, a spokesperson for the office said generation assets such as the Mississagi hydroelectric system and the gas-fired Lennox plant in southwestern Ontario, both of which Ontario Power Generation will be divesting, represent very valuable assets that should be a desirable way for companies such as TransCanada to enter the deregulated market. Also note that TransCanada has expressed concerns only about opportunities in Ontario's electric market, and the company already has rather extensive gas-pipeline investments in the province. Nevertheless, enabling the opportunity for new companies to gain generating assets currently owned by Ontario Power Generation is a key factor to the success of Ontario's deregulated market. 

Moreover, Ontario inches ever closer to a competitive electric market, but a good number of concerns about the province's plan for deregulation remain unresolved. There is great anticipation for the report that is expected shortly from the Ontario Energy Board, which may specifically address the divestiture policy for Ontario Power Generation that has troubled companies such as TransCanada. Certainly, there is great hope that no further delays of the deregulation start date in Ontario, and that province officials either maintain or accelerate the May 2002 start. Just as Canadian officials have closely watched the move toward deregulation in the United States, U.S. companies continue to monitor Canada's slow, province-by-province progression toward competition. As noted, Mirant Corp. already has gained a market edge in the natural-gas sector of Canada by acquiring the assets of TransCanada. Duke Energy, Calpine Corp. and Devon Energy have also penetrated the Canadian natural-gas market with pending acquisitions of Westcoast Energy, Encal Energy and Anderson Exploration, respectively. The next horizon for the Canadian energy market is electric deregulation, and industry eyes remain on Ontario as the only Canadian province that is following Alberta into electric competition.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Competition Approved for California's Intrastate Natural-Gas Pipelines 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis




[News item from Associated Press] California state power regulators voted Dec. 11 to deregulate further the transmission of natural gas within Southern California, a decision hailed by the industry and derided by consumer advocates. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted 3-2 to approve a proposal that allows Southern California Gas Co., the nation's largest gas utility, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) to sell space on their ""backbone"" transmission pipelines. These pipelines carry natural gas from out of state to a smaller distribution system in California that then transports it to homes, businesses, factories, and power plants.

Analysis: This controversial vote by the CPUC took place last week, but has not received a great amount of industry analysis. This is rather surprising because the vote carries enormous potential impact for the way in which natural-gas capacity is bought and sold along pipelines owned by Southern California Gas Co. and SDG&E in the southern part of the state. Considering the fiasco that opening the state's electric market became over the last year, it is a risky move for California's regulators to open a competitive market for the right to transport gas along these pipelines at this time, even though the issue has been under debate at the commission for years. However, the rationale for the decision is that the new system will allow customers to better control the point from which their natural-gas supply originates, which theoretically should lower costs and preserve space along the pipelines that the customers don't need. Critics of the plan, especially The Utility Reform Network (TURN), say that allowing competition along the natural-gas pipelines in California could allow fewer companies to control most of the pipeline space, which could in fact cause the opposite of the intended effect and drive up energy costs. A case that has been used by both sides of the debate is that of El Paso Corp., which found itself in a lengthy lawsuit this year when it was charged with giving preferential access to its pipeline to one of its affiliates, which allegedly played a role in driving up energy costs in the state.

Before analyzing the potential impact of the CPUC's ruling, let's first establish specifically what the ruling entails and some background of the companies involved. Put into a nutshell, the ruling creates a competitive market for the right to transport and store natural gas along the pipelines owned by Southern California Gas and SDG&E, which are both subsidiaries of San Diego-based Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE). As noted, Southern California Gas is ranked as the largest natural-gas distribution utility in the country and serves a territory of 23,000-square-miles that ranges from central California to the Mexican border.

Following a standard that is already in place among interstate pipelines, including the ones that transport power into California, both of these companies will now be allowed to sell large industrial customers space on their intrastate ""backbone"" pipelines, giving customers firm transportation rights on the pipelines. The pipelines are referred to as ""backbone"" because they are part of the smaller distribution system that transports power to factories and power plants (along with homes and businesses). It is important to note that the CPUC's ruling impacts only large consumers of natural gas in California, which includes electric generating plants. Residential and small business consumers that use natural gas will continue to have regulated gas-transmission costs. 

Under the new auction system, power producers and industrial natural-gas customers of the two companies will bid to buy pipeline space, with preference being given to those bidders that intend to reserve space for the longest period of time. According to the CPUC, the ruling creates three ""tiers"" of accessibility to the capacity on the pipelines. The first tier includes residential and small business customers, who are not included in the new competition and will automatically have about 1,044 million cubic feet per day of capacity on the pipelines reserved for their use. The second tier includes industrial customers who will now be able to participate in the competition, and will be allowed to bid on half of the remaining capacity. The third tier includes all other market participants, including natural-gas marketers, which will be allowed to bid on whatever capacity is left. Both Southern California Gas and SDG&E reportedly intend to phase in auctions by the end of 2002 for their largest customers to transport natural gas. The auctions will be for transmission rights that can be traded to other parties. 

The CPUC also established two different levels of payment options for the bidding process. As one option, bidders can pay a fixed price of 7.2 cents per million British thermal units (MMBtu) that would cover all of the capacity on the pipeline that they have reserved, regardless if it is ultimately used or not. As a second option, bidders can pay for only 50 percent of the reserved capacity at the fixed price of 7.2 cents per MMBtu, and 50 percent at a higher price that only applies to the capacity that they ultimately use. In addition, the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, an important point that critics claim could allow buyers to gain more control over the pipeline than allotted in the ruling. 

As noted, the measure passed the CPUC in a 3-2 vote. The ruling will remain in place until 2006, at which time the commission can decide to renew it. The three commissioners that supported the measure were Richard Bilas, Henry Duque and Geoffrey Brown. Loretta Lynch, president of the CPUC, and Carl Wood voted against the measure. Wood said he opposed the measure because it was based on data accumulated before natural-gas prices dramatically increased during the winter of 2000-2001.

Another reason why the three commissioners voted to approve this measure was a belief that deregulating gas transmission in the state would help to keep large customers from leaving intrastate pipelines in favor of using interstate pipelines, which are not regulated by the CPUC. An exodus among industrial users from intrastate pipelines, according to the three commissioners, could leave residential and small business consumers with higher costs associated with maintaining the pipelines. However, regulators were quick to qualify their vote by saying the decision to allow competition for the cost of transporting natural gas for industrial users did not represent total deregulation. Instead, the commissioners said that the ruling simply amounts to ""less regulation."" 

As I mentioned, the case against El Paso Corp. (NYSE: EPG) was used as an example to support both sides of the debate over allowing competition among the natural-gas intrastate pipelines. The case against El Paso Corp. is a very complicated one, but it essentially comes down to one core issue. The case revolves around allegations that during the period of May to November 2000, El Paso improperly shared market-sensitive information with one of its affiliates, which drove up natural-gas prices, pre-empted competition from non-affiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range of $3.7 billion for Californians. El Paso Corp. has consistently maintained that it engaged in no wrongdoing. According to a report issued by the state Assembly, natural-gas prices in California increased from $6.6 billion in 1999 to $12.3 billion in 2000 to $7.9 billion for only the first three months of 2001. In October, El Paso Corp. was absolved of the charges of manipulating natural-gas prices in California, but an investigation continues regarding any improper sharing of information between affiliates. The relevance of this case is that those opposed to opening up California's intrastate pipelines to capacity believe the new rules could allow for one company to step in and gain control over a portion of the pipeline and thereby be able to drive up price.

Those in favor of the CPUC's new ruling say the comparisons to the El Paso case are unfounded. For starters, the ruling restricts companies from owning more than 30 percent of the pipeline, which theoretically should prevent a company from gaining an ability to control prices. Critics, however, say that the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, which could potentially provide a loophole that would give a company control over more than 30 percent of pipeline capacity. 

The issue of potential price spikes associated with natural gas is one of the remaining questions that only time will be able to answer. Critics of the ruling such as TURN say allowing competition among the natural-gas pipelines creates the same market dynamics as deregulation of the state's electricity market, which some say opened the door to gaming and market manipulation. In other words, TURN argues, the CPUC ruling opens the door for one company to enter the market and buy up a significant amount of capacity along the intrastate gas pipelines, thereby giving that company the opportunity to control prices. As the new ruling won't take effect until another year when Southern California Gas and SDG&E begin receiving bids for capacity space on their pipelines, we won't know any time soon if prices will be impacted. However, critics claim that a sharp downturn in temperatures in California during the winter season that drives up demand could be the first indicator of whether or not the new ruling will lead to a sharp increase in energy prices.

Moreover, the opening of competition along capacity space on California's intrastate natural-gas pipelines is a surprising departure from the state's discontinuation of deregulation within the power sector. It is too early to tell how the new ruling will impact energy prices, and of course this question is the source of great debate (with one side saying that prices will drop and the other side saying that prices will increase). Perhaps the larger issue, however, is the control over the state's pipelines that could be impacted by this ruling. Even 30-percent capacity control, the amount that the CPUC is opening to competition, would be considered excessive by some other states. For instance, in Texas 20-percent control is considered a maximum standard. Again, whether or not the allowance of competition will spark the abuse of capacity control on the intrastate pipelines is something that remains to be seen. We do know that electric competition in California became a disastrous experiment, but even with this history the state is moving forward with bringing competition to its intrastate natural-gas pipelines.

Williams and Duke Commence Construction
of Gulfstream Project 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Business Wire] Gulfstream National Gas System announced today that it has received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approval to commence mainline pipeline construction in Florida. With this approval, Gulfstream now has all the major segments of its 753-mile pipeline project under construction and on schedule to deliver natural gas in June 2002. 

Analysis: The Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is by far the largest pipeline project in the Southeast, has been designed specifically to deliver natural gas into the Florida wholesale market. When finished, the project reportedly will be the largest natural-gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico, with capacity to transport approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, and the first new transportation system to serve Florida in more than 40 years. Williams (NYSE: WMB) and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) jointly own the pipeline, having purchased it from Coastal Corp. last year, a sale that was made possible due to regulatory requirements surrounding Coastal's merger with El Paso Corp. Along with projects still being led by El Paso Corp. (NYSE: EPG), the Gulfstream project highlights the continuing emphasis on pipeline construction, which by some accounts is experiencing the largest wave of expansion since the early 1960s. 

Williams and Duke have provided a current status report regarding construction of the pipeline, including notice that more than 200 of the 431 miles of offshore pipeline have been laid in the Gulf of Mexico. Gulfstream also has already laid pipe in parts of Florida and Alabama, some of the more sensitive regions along the pipeline's path. 

Like other pipeline developments, the Gulfstream project, the construction for which began on June 1, 2001, is being driven by several factors, including demand (which for the most part remains strong), the prominence of natural gas as the fuel source for new power plants and a presidential administration that is supportive of production. What is perhaps most interesting about the boom in pipeline construction is that many of the same companies that own or control natural-gas supplies are also quickly acquiring or partnering with other firms that specialize in pipeline construction. 

For background, subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their intent to jointly purchase Coastal Corp.'s 100-percent interest in the Gulfstream Natural Gas System project in November 2000. The project was originally sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp., a $16 billion Houston-based energy holding company with operations in natural-gas production, distribution and marketing. However, due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Corp.'s merger with El Paso Energy Corp., Coastal Corp. was forced by the Federal Trade Commission to divest the project. As a result, Duke Energy and Williams found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project and its valuable inroad to the Florida market. 

Approximately 400 miles of the route, which originates in Mobile, Ala., crosses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters. Gulfstream offers 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural-gas capacity per day, and is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and power-generation facilities that plan on using high-efficiency natural-gas turbines. Already, the project has precedent agreements with 10 large Florida utilities and power generation facilities. 

Duke and Williams have agreed to jointly manage the operation and development of the Gulfstream project. It's not difficult to assess why Duke and Williams would be willing to co-own the project. The two companies, which have historically had a collaborative relationship, already own significant amounts of interstate natural-gas pipeline capacity. Between its two subsidiaries involved in natural-gas production-Duke Energy Field Services and Duke Energy Gas Transmission-Duke Energy owns and operates about 57,000 miles of pipeline and 12,000 interstate miles of capacity. Williams' five interstate natural-gas pipelines reportedly deliver about 16 percent of the natural gas consumed in the United States. The company's vast 27,300-mile pipeline network stretches from coast to coast and from Mexico to Canada, serving more than 48 million residential, commercial and industrial natural-gas users. In fact, the two companies already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeline project in Florida, a 674-mile pipeline that would have followed a similar route as the Gulfstream project will follow. Duke and Williams are no longer planning the Buccaneer project now that they have acquired the Gulfstream project. The addition of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and offer a prime position for them to expand their independent operations in Florida. 

The CEO of Williams' gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market would support only one new pipeline coming into the state. By joining together, Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the high-growth state as it eventually becomes competitive. First among the priorities for the project is to ensure adequate pipeline capacity by June 2002, and meeting the projected 10,000-MW electric generation growth that is expected in the state of Florida by 2007. 

Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project accelerates its own entry into Florida. In fact, Richard Priory, Duke's CEO, conceded at a conference last year that Duke's future success would result from its natural-gas operations. Specifically, Duke has been focused on merchant plant and natural-gas pipeline construction for some time. As of this summer, Duke was rated third in announced merchant plants (behind Calpine and Panda), and has made no bones about the fact that its strategy is centered around building additional merchant plants and acquiring natural-gas pipelines. Thus, the acquisition of Gulfstream is a perfectly appropriate move for the company to make. 

Most projections place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new generation as the demand for natural gas is expected to increase from 23 trillion to 30 trillion cubic feet per year by 2010. In addition, coal and nuclear generation came under environmental and public scrutiny over the last two decades, at a time when natural-gas prices were comparatively low. All of these factors have created a strong market for natural-gas generation. 

Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market, so this pipeline could facilitate easier expansion in the state. About a year ago, the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction of a Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach. However, the state's three IOUs appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that merchant plants were not allowed under state law. The Florida Supreme Court overturned the decision of the state PSC, blocking Duke's entry into the state. Consequently, Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as another way to get into the Florida market (and one that is potentially more profitable). 

Along with Duke and Williams, El Paso Energy Corp. also is focused on building and acquiring new pipeline capacity. The company is the parent of subsidiaries El Paso Natural Gas, a regulated company that operates pipelines, and El Paso Merchant Energy, an unregulated company that markets natural gas. El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Division pipeline, which includes 14,604 miles of interstate pipeline, serving markets in California, the southwestern United States and throughout the Rocky Mountains. In fact, El Paso owns and operates the largest natural-gas pipeline in North America, totaling more than 58,000 miles of pipeline reaching all the major growth areas in this country.

"Northwest Reserves","We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds.  $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book.  During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.

Just a quick question while I remember, as you know I am giving an overview of the DASH process and the Legal Risk Memo that must accompany any DASH.
My understanding is that the Legal Risk Memo must be attached to the DASH when the DASH is circulated and that on the face of the DASH form prepared by RAC, we should not be and there should not appear any Legal Risk assessment, which must only be contained in the Legal Risk Memo. The DASH should simply refer to ""See attached Legal Risk Memo"".
	
I am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice.

In addition I am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the Legal Risk Memo before it is circulated with the DASH.
	
See you shortly.

AES Hits Brick Wall in Venezuelan Acquisition 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Venezuelan telecommunications firm CANTV, or Compania Anomima Nacional Telefonos, facing a $1.37-billion hostile takeover bid by AES Corp. (NYSE: AES) has forced a showdown with the U.S.-based global power company by announcing a share repurchase program. The Board of Directors of CANTV, Venezuela's biggest telecommunications company, recommended that shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to 15 percent of CANTV's shares at a price of $30 per American Depositary Share (ADS), or approximately $4.29 per share. Analysts said the CANTV Board's proposals, which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set for Oct. 24, clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES. 

Analysis: AES' expansion in Latin America's telecommunications market was always seen as a risky move, and now that risk seems to be resulting in a big bite out of the company's strategy. CANTV, which was an appealing takeover target for AES due to its long-standing monopoly over the telecom market in Venezuela, has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), which holds a 28.5-percent stake in the company. Verizon came out in support of the 15-percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV, which clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES' efforts to gain control over the company. The repurchase could be seen as a power play, with Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV, which many analysts might see as a more appropriate synergy. However, this story also highlights the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin America, especially since CANTV's resistance comes on the heels of AES' pulling out of another acquisition project in Ecuador. 

For background, it is important to note that AES already owns 6.9 percent of CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas, Venezuela's largest private electricity company. Thus, the takeover effort is an attempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from Verizon. CANTV, which was privatized a decade ago, is a full-service telecommunications provider offering switched and local, domestic and international long-distance service throughout Venezuela Company. CANTV also offers mobile cellular services, wireless services, Internet access and other value-added services, and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and national network of public telephone lines. CANTV became privatized about 10 years ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixed-line telephone service in Venezuela. The company has a market capitalization of $2.6 billion. 

AES had bid $24 in cash for each of the 28.57-million U.S.-listed shares in CANTV and $3.43 in cash for each of the 200 million shares of CANTV traded in Venezuela. AES' offer for CANTV's American shares represents a 9.2-percent premium over CANTV's closing price of $21.98 on Aug. 29, the time at which the takeover effort was launched. From the start of the offer, some critics charged that this bid was too low, but AES has maintained that the offer is fair. AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTV's mobile services, which account for about a quarter of the company's revenues, and distribute the proceeds to shareholders. 

CANTV was never very receptive to AES' bid, and did consider it to be a hostile takeover. In fact, workers' representatives at CANTV circulated a statement strongly objecting to the bid from AES, stating that the deal would severely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers. CANTV employees hold a 10.9-percent interest in the company. Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistance a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock. Note that CANTV will most likely issue the buyback program at $30, compared to the $24 that AES had offered. Thus, the challenge for AES, if it still wants to gain control over CANTV, will be to increase its already 9.2-percent premium offer. The word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed with its takeover attempt, and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attempts. 

AES' rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely twofold in nature. First, AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin American market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil, Chile and other countries. Just this week, AES announced its penetration of the Argentina market by inking a $376-million deal to purchase distribution and generation assets in that country from New Jersey-based Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG). In another recent announcement, AES launched a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificates of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile, a company that consists of 716 MW of generation and 1,056 kilometers of transmission. In fact, AES reportedly rivals Spain's Endesa as the region's most dominant power company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business throughout Latin America. Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the United States, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, many investors now perceive the company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America, which constitutes a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the various Latin American countries. 

However, AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a $128-million takeover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor. Currently, Edelnor, which is one of the largest electrical generators in Chile, is controlled by Mirant Corp., one of AES' direct competitors in the independent power producing market. Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region, Mirant has announced that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unless it can be assured of repayment. AES did not give a reason for its decision to terminate the Edelnor takeover, but one can surmise that investor reactor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor. Further, on Sept. 25, AES cut its earnings estimate for 2001 to a range of $1.25 to $1.45 per share from a previous range of $1.75 to $1.90. AES blamed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and U.S. dollar, lower U.K. power prices, and the company's inability to replace earnings anticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant. The drop in AES' earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the company needed to purchase Edelnor. 

AES shares were priced at $24.25 prior to the earnings revision. After the announcement, at least as of early morning trading on Sept. 27, AES shares were priced at $12.25, significantly down from the 52-week high of $73, which is what the stock was priced at a year ago. As of early morning trading on Oct. 17, AES shares were priced at $14.81. 

Moreover, investors did not react positively to AES' plan to increase its stake in CANTV. In fact, after word of the deal began to circulate on Aug. 29 (a day on which many stocks fell) AES' stock closed down $2.94, or 8.3 percent, to a 20-month low of $32.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. AES CEO Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase did not represent a change of strategy for AES, which he says will remain focused on power. In addition, Bakke noted that the purchase does not represent a new venture for AES as the company already holds telecom assets in Brazil and Bolivia. Further, Bakke clearly stated that AES is ""not going to announce a bunch of telecom acquisitions around the world."" Nevertheless, some investors believe that AES is imprudently expanding into the telecom sector, which is already significantly troubled, and becoming too heavily entrenched in Latin America, a market that is prone to political volatility. One investment analyst perhaps spoke for many when he commented that AES has little experience in the telecom sector and its limited experience to date has not been terribly successful. This, coupled with the general market downturn for most companies with telecom exposure, does not make for a good recipe from an investor's perspective, at least as of today. 

In fairness to AES, penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a very strategic move from a long-term perspective. With a population of 23.5 million, Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other related services. In addition, Venezuela is an asset-rich country, particularly with regard to oil resources. According to the Department of Energy, Venezuela is important to world energy markets because it holds proven oil reserves of 77 billion barrels, plus billions of barrels of extra-heavy oil and bitumen. Venezuela consistently ranks as one the top suppliers of U.S. oil imports and is among the top 10 crude oil producers in the world. In addition, as noted AES' investments in Latin America are not exclusively focused on Venezuela, as the company also is present in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, etc. 

Concerns about telecom arguably overshadow concerns about expansion in Latin America and play a larger role in the drop in AES' stock, especially when we consider that AES has been present in Latin America for some time. Only little more than a year ago, the telecom sector was at its peak, with billions of capital investment flooding into the sector as wildly optimistic expectations for demand seemingly exaggerated the scale of the market. However, a massive downturn has ensued, impacting not only companies operating in the telecom space but the nation's entire economy as well. The bottom of the telecom sector has fallen out, due in large part to the fact that the increase in bandwidth capacity has outpaced the growth in market demand. 

As I've said before when analyzing this company, the further that AES departs from its core strategy, the more likely it is that we will continue to see volatility in the company's stock. Up until these recent announcements, AES maintained that it was engaged in three lines of businesses, which were all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delivery services and retail energy marketing. Generation always appeared to be the main core of the company's business model, as AES controls some 125 facilities totaling over 44 gigawatts of capacity worldwide. This business model worked well for AES and was well received by investors. Any perceived deviation from this successful strategy-especially if it includes expansion into the dangerous territory of telecom-could mark a new and risky era for AES. 

Nevertheless, one could also surmise that AES has found a market opportunity that is worth exploring. Latin America has low electrification and Internet usage statistics. Some analysts project high growth in the next 5 to 10 years in Latin America in both electrification and Internet use, which in turn involves telecommunications. The telecom industry is struggling at the moment. Thus, if one believes that telecom will make a comeback, then buying now may make a wise strategy for those involved.

"Eucatex deal renegotiated","This is just an example of how Enron got affected by ANEEL's decision to lower the spot price from R$684/MWh to R$336/MWh.  This Eucatex deal involved both a fixed payment and a variable payment (the latter based on a % of the spot price).

Subject:	Eucatex deal renegotiated

We've re-negotiated the Eucatex deal in order to extract more value out of the transaction for Enron. According to the new structure the value of the deal will move from a negative U$1.1million to a positive U$0.1million. The old vs. new conditions are as follow:

Old deal (existing contract)
structure	: PPA (Enron buys the power)
volumes	: 12MW (6MW firm + up to 6MW interruptible)
pricing	: R$155/MWh (floor price) + 40% of the upside against MAE prices
term	: November 2001 to March 2003 (October 2001 on interruptible basis)
guarantees	: R$3.0 million surety bond issue by Malucelli Insurance Co. (Brazilian company)

New deal
Structure	: Call Option (Enron buys the call)
Volumes	: 11.5MW (9.0MW firm + up to 2.5 MW interruptible)
pricing	: R$60/MWh premium + R$107/MWh strike. Premium will be paid upfront to Eucatex (R$6.6million)
term	: same as above. Interruptible power generated in October will be purchased for R$220,00/MWh (fixed price).
guarantees	: surety bond of R$6.6million + commercial exposure (to be calculated by RAC). We are also considering to switch Mallucelli for an international insurance company, depending on RAC's view. Cost of the insurance will be paid by Eucatex. It is also important to stress that obtaining a solid surety bond is a condition precedent on executing the deal, and Eucatex is aware of that.

Rgds,

Marcelo

"FW: Didn't he sign a non-compete","Jim Fallon asked me to forward this article on Ken Rice's new venture.


New startup proposes global virtual services
Marlene Tissot
12 November 2001 
A project to build a global network for multimedia services, based entirely on switched virtual circuits (SVCs), has been revealed to CWI. And it intends to prove the value of connectionless network services for customers by carrying output from the Olympic Games in Beijing around the world. While new carriers are counting their cash and hoping to hold the fort until the market turns around, SynerG Communications Ltd., believes it can prove to everybody that it is still possible to launch an ambitious telecoms business, even in these harsh times. Backed by an Asian media mogul that prefers to keep a low profile, as well as an equipment vendor and a network operator in the United States, its founders claim SynerG already has verbal commitments from customers amounting to $100 million in revenues. And they say they are negotiating to gain rights to carry multimedia content from the Beijing Olympics in 2008. SynerG's business plan is based on a relatively uncommon way to deliver bandwidth. Ken Rice, the chairman and founder of California-based International SynerG Communications Holdings Ltd., says that potential cost savings for end-users will be compelling because they will be able to provision bandwidth on an ad hoc basis, giving them so-called bandwidth on demand. A 41-node global ATM-based switched virtual circuit network will focus on delivering content across Asia, Europe and North America. Under most existing contracts, customers pay for leased-line capacity they do not actually use, according to Rice, who claims his project is significantly different. ""It's a utility-based network,"" says Rice. ""(It) generates billing for what is used, not what is contracted for as in fixed line configurations."" But while end users are increasingly scrutinizing their spend, they have also grown accustomed to always-on fat pipes and will need reassurance of the constant availability of the circuits. ""If you are a customer, you need to be sure that the capacity is there at all time,"" says Maureen Coulter, a senior analyst at Gartner Group in Egham, England. ""SVCs are appropriate for content as long as the service provider manages the quality of transport for the end-user."" SynerG claims that this quality of service will be ensured by employing Pathfinder, its proprietary network management software. And the business plan for SynerG shows Lucent Technologies and AT&T among its suppliers and shareholders. Lucent has taken a 2.11% equity stake, and a network provisioning deal gives AT&T a possible equity option. AT&T has experience marketing SVCs in the U.S., although in the case of SynerG it is thought only to be providing bandwidth from its global network. There might also be something in the new network business model for SynerG's circuit supplier. Even if revenues from providing the circuits to SynerG are not immense, neither is the risk the carrier takes by doing it, since it gets a revenue share each time bandwidth is used by a customer. While the cost of offering such a service is moderate, it may provide a new stream of revenue for carriers. ""It's something I expect we'll see more and more,"" said Gartner's Coulter. ""In the content distribution market ... carriers want to squeeze every penny out of their capacity."" To make sure it can guarantee delivery to consumers, SynerG says it will operate a 41-node ATM-based switched virtual circuit network in nine European countries and 23 city networks in the U.S., according to its business plan. Operations will be headed up by chief executive Fred Metzgen, a former business development director for BT Syncordia Global Solutions, who will be based in Newport Beach, California. Metzgen has been touring Europe and the U.S. to get the $10-million startup funds he estimates SynerG needs. Metzgen has acquired a portfolio of potential partners and content distributors, including education and training technology developer China Education Network, digital video developer Electric Image and e-commerce platform developer Evolutionary Networks, Inc. SynerG has taken shareholdings in some of these.

"RE: ENE Form 10-Q Accounting Matter --  Initial Report","One further note:  Failure to timely file a conforming Form 10-Q violates SEC rules and regulations.  The revolver also contains a covenant requiring ENE to comply with laws, rules, regulations and orders to the extent noncompliance therewith would have a material adverse effect on ENE and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  Failure to so comply constitutes an Event of Default under the revolver if the failure continues for more than 30 days after ENE is given notice thereof by the Paying Agent.

Subject:	ENE Form 10-Q Accounting Matter --  Initial Report

I understand that AA may not provide the review of interim financial information that the SEC requires to be obtained in respect of Form 10-Q filings ( Article 10 of Regulation SX).  Jordan asked me to give an update in an hour about the impact of this on covenants in ENE credit and other instruments requiring delivery of ENE's 10Qs.

(1)	I have not yet been able to ascertain whether (i) the AA review or any statement in respect thereof is required to be filed with the SEC, or (ii) if not so required, ENE would file the 10-Q without having obtained the review.  

(2)	ENE's 364-day corporate revolver (and most other ENE instruments containing the subject covenant) requires ENE to make available either on ""EDGAR"" or ENE's home page on World Wide Web, or otherwise make available to the Banks promptly after the filing or sending thereof, and in any event within 75 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters, a copy of ENE's report on Form 10-Q.  If ENE does not file the 10-Q, it arguably could nevertheless send it to the banks as confidential information (to comply with Regulation FD) within the required time period and satisfy the covenant.  The revolver contains a confidentiality provision.
Failure to deliver the 10-Q constitutes an Event of Default under the revolver if the failure continues for more than 30 days after ENE has received notice thereof by the Paying Agent.

I will continue to pursue information from the accountants.

Pricing Synthetic CDO's
Derivatives Week - October 29, 2001

Traditionally collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) involve a transfer of
collateral assets. The CDO liabilities then reference the cash flows
(principal and interest) of the collateral assets. But CDOs are increasingly
issued in synthetic form, where there is no physical transfer of collateral.
In these structures the CDO references default losses, rather than the cash
flows of the referenced collateral. 

Credit Default Swaps 

In their simplest form synthetic CDOs are akin to single name credit default
swaps. A credit default swap is a contract where one party ,the protection
buyer, makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on a
credit event. In a single name credit default swap, the credit event is the
default of a single issuer. Thus, the price of the credit default swaps
reflects the market's view of the default likelihood of the reference name. 

In unfunded form a synthetic CDO is essentially a basket default swap. In
this case, in return for a premium, the protection seller makes contingent
payments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket of
assets. The protection may be for first loss or equity, in which case the
seller pays for the initial default losses, up to some threshold; second
loss or mezzanine, where the seller pays losses beyond the first loss
threshold up to some higher limit; or senior, where the seller pays all
losses beyond a threshold. 

Synthetic CDOs may also be structured in funded form. The simplest form of
this structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket default
swap. The initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and at
the outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from the
bond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap. As losses
occur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to pay
the required contingent payments. At the maturity of the structure the
investor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position. In both
funded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic CDOs is primarily a
matter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves. 

Correlation Products 

It is often said that synthetic CDOs are correlation products because their
value depends not only on the probability of default for each individual
name in the reference portfolio, but also on the correlation between those
names. Consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of two
names, each with a 5% probability of default. Assume two levels of
protection, one paying on the first default, and one paying on the second.
If the names are independent, then the probability that the first loss
protection is triggered is 1 - (0.95)2 = 9.75%, that is, 100% less the
chance that there are zero defaults. The probability that the second loss
protection is triggered is (0.05)2 = 0.25%, that is, only if there are two
defaults. On the other hand, if the defaults are perfectly correlated, then
there are only two possibilities: either both or neither of the names
default. Thus, the probability that either protection is triggered is the
probability that both names default, or 5%. Note that for the first loss
protection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that the
protection is invoked, and therefore reduced the fair price of this
protection. For the second loss piece, the increased correlation has
increased the trigger likelihood and fair price. 

The relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for the
first loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps. For
the first loss piece, since losses are capped, the pricing is driven
primarily by the likelihood that no losses occur, which increases with
correlation. For the senior piece, the pricing is driven by the likelihood
that an extreme loss occurs, which is greater in cases of higher
correlation. 

Pricing 

Based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual default
probabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool. Since
individual default probabilities can often be obtained from single name
credit-default swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for synthetic
CDOs. 

Consider an example structure with USD36 million of collateral, where first
loss protects against the first USD5 million of losses, second loss protects
against the next USD10 million of losses, and the remaining losses are
protected by the senior tranche. We can model spreads on each of these
tranches at different correlation levels. For example, using a correlation
of 45%, we obtain model spreads of two basis points, 250bps and 1,642bps for
the senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively. We can
repeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain the
sensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation. Figure 1 shows the
normalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlation
levels. We can see that the cost of protection for the senior tranche
increases with increasing correlation, that is the cost increases as senior
debt gets riskier, while the first loss protection cost decreases with
increasing correlation, that is the cost decreases as equity gets less
risky. Note that, in this particular example the cost of second loss
protection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation. 

Implied Correlation 

We can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from CDO prices in
the same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and the
Black-Scholes pricing model. An implied correlation extracted in this
fashion depends on the specific CDO pricing model, but the observations
above hold generally. Suppose the market spreads for our example structure
are 2bps, 150bps and 2,000bps for the senior, second loss, and first loss
protection respectively. We can compare these observed spreads with our
model spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche. For
example the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the senior
tranche, 2bps, when we price it using a 45% correlation. In other words, the
implied correlation for the senior tranche is 45%. The implied correlation
for each tranche can be inferred from Figure 1 as the correlation level with
which our pricing model recovers the observed market spread. We can see that
for the first and second loss tranches, the implied correlation is roughly
20%, while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is 45%. 

A first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market a
synthetic tranche on an ongoing basis. As we observe changes in the spreads
for the individual names in the pool, we can reprice the tranches above by
assuming the correlation level is constant, but updating the spreads.
Additionally, implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis.
For example, senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value as
correlation increases. Since both tranches depend on the same basket of
names, we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation. As
mentioned above, the implied correlation of the senior tranche (45%) is
significantly higher than that of the second loss tranche (20%). This means
that senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection. We
can also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that the
pools in two different CDOs have similar characteristics, in terms of credit
quality, industry, and geographical distribution. For example, if two CDOs
have similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparable
implied correlations for their senior tranches. All else being equal, a
discrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of a
discrepancy in price between the two structures. 


CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000
Risk News - October 29, 2001
By Naomi Humphries

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has released the final rules
relating to the trading of equity futures products in the United States.
These rules implement provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act
of 2000 (CFMA) that lift the 19-year ban on the trading of single-stock and
narrow-based stock index futures in the US. 

The final rules are in line with the new CFMA statutory provisions regarding
the specification of listing standards and conditions for trading security
futures products. The rules also establish requirements related to the
self-certification of rules and rule amendments, reporting of data,
speculative position limits, and special provisions regarding the contract
design for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futures
products. 

The CFTC received comment from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex)
and the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG). The CFTC adopted several
revisions consistent with comments, but stated: ""Generally, the commentators
supported the proposed rules."" 

The CFTC also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rules
governing commodity futures and options intermediaries on October 19,
following the enactment of the CFMA and the resulting revisions to the
Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Key rules governing intermediaries, including
futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operators
and commodity trading advisers, have been revised to provide greater
flexibility consistent with the mandate of the CFMA to streamline and
eliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act. 

They include a provision for retail customers to have broad access to
registered derivatives transaction execution facilities, by permitting them
to trade through a commodity trading adviser with $25 million or more in
assets under management, and a proposal to replace the current prescriptive
rule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices. 

The CFTC claimed that comments from Fimat, a registered futures commission
merchant, and securities broker-dealer, Exchange Analytics, an ethics
training provider, the CBOT, the National Futures Association and the
Managed Funds Association, all generally supported the adoption of the
proposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries. It
added that the issue that generated the most discussion was ethics training.


Acting chairman at the CFTC, James Newsome, said: ""These rules are just the
first step in the Commission's review of appropriate regulatory relief for
intermediaries. We have begun the intermediary study that Congress directed
us to perform, and we may well be implementing additional regulatory reforms
prior to the study's conclusion."" 



Banks tout economic derivatives
IFR - October 29, 2001

Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan will be using an auction mechanism to deliver
the new derivatives products, which they say will be self-clearing and
self-hedging. The solution licensed to the two banks to create derivatives
on economic statistics will also be applicable to corporate earnings and
revenues, mortgage prepayments, equity prices, central bank target rates,
index-related products, electric power, weather degree days, credit or any
event-driven market where the development of risk management tools has been
constrained by illiquidity, according to the developer of the solution, New
York-based Longitude.

""Once the mechanisms are up and running and validated, we could envision
structured notes on swaps linked to the auction process itself,"" said JP
Morgan Chase's Chris Harvey, managing director of foreign exchange and
interest rate derivatives sales for the Americas.

Deutsche Bank has picked Germany's lfo and Japan's Tankan as the debut
products for its economic derivatives franchises in Europe and Japan. JP
Morgan Chase is still in the process of selecting its inaugural US economic
statistics product.

JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank declined to disclose the cost of their franchise
on the economic derivatives. To retain their exclusive agreements with
Longitude for the Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA)-enabled
derivatives, the banks must meet performance benchmarks. Longitude charges a
fee based on the notional volume cleared through its system.

Using Longitude's PDCA bookrunner product, Deutsche Bank, for example, would
engage in pre-marketing or preselling activity that is similar to that in a
bond or equity syndicate offering, followed by a short auction period.
During the auction period, the bank would submit orders to buy or sell
digital options on the economic data covered to Longitude's web-based
system.

Upon receipt of the orders, Longitude's system produces bid/offer prices for
the derivatives being offered, and other relevant market equilibrium
statistics, such as limit order books. Longitude routes this information
back to the bank, which publishes the statistics for its customers. In this
example, Deutsche Bank would be counterparty to transactions that are
filled.

An order that is filled would result in an International Swaps and
Derivatives Association-documented transaction. The filled orders should
hedge themselves because in a pari-mutuel system all claims that end
in-the-money are funded by those out-of-the-money. ""Longitude's clients can
offer derivatives without assuming additional risks on their own balance
sheets,"" said Andrew Lawrence, chief executive of Longitude. As the systern
accepts orders with limit prices, capital markets participants can have a
high level of price certainty.

In a pari-mutuel system, prices are market-driven and determined by customer
participation, rather than a model or subjective assessment of the price of
risk.

Doubfers
""A pari-mutuel model is a demand and supply based market, so the question
becomes: Will there be enough participants?"" said Richard Sandor, chief
executive of Environmental Financial Products and one of the architects of
the interest rate futures markets.

""Is it view taking or [traditional] hedging? I'm not sure,"" said one bulge
bracket firm's head of market risk management.

Numbers of participants are difficult to predict because they will depend
upon the design of the specific auction, said Longitude's Lawrence. ""Perhaps
as few as 10-15 total orders can form a very rich auction equilibrium,"" he
said.

The cost of operating the call auction is another consideration. A high
transaction charge will mean less money for the winners. ""It varies from
market to market. But because banks are not taking market risk, the price
for the service will be modest,"" said Lawrence. ""In general, it has always
been considered extremely desirable to disaggregate risk factors to the
fullest extent possible because they can always be easily recombined.""

""Let's assume a health maintenance organisation (HMO) wishes to hedge out
its exposure to annual medical cost inflation in the US, and that the health
industry accounts for slightly less than 20% of US gross domestic product.
What can this HMO do now in the traditional markets to mitigate this risk?
Not much. But JP Morgan could offer derivatives based directly upon this
very important measure in order to offer a risk management product for this
HMO,"" he said.

Both JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are expecting early interest from financial
institutions, and fixed-income participants in particular, because no
mechanism for isolating and hedging or speculating on the growth rate of a
country's economy currently exists.

Deutsche Bank's strategy for introducing the new products will initially
hinge on drumming up internal interest, said Kevin Rodgers, global head of
currency options at Deutsche Bank in London. In January, the bank's trading
desks will start using it internally to hedge their own positions. This
activity will be useful in providing the bank with probability
distributions, he added.

Deutsche Bank will then try to get other banks' proprietary and swap desks
to use the system. The new products will probably be available for use by
hedge funds, commodity trading advisers and fund managers by the third
quarter of next year. JP Morgan Chase expects to start its franchise market
on US economic statistic derivatives next month.

(kdhulster@isda-eur.org)

DATE:		December 4, 2001

RE:		Credit Derivatives Documentation; Review of 1999 Definitions


Three Supplements and Commentaries have been published on ISDA's website
relating to amendments to the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions (the
""Definitions"").  These three Supplements to the Definitions are: (i) the
Restructuring Supplement published on May 11, 2001; (ii) the Supplement
Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations, published on
November 9, 2001; and (iii) the Supplement on Successor and Credit Events,
published on November 28, 2001.  As indicated at the Credit Derivatives
Market Practice Committee meeting on November 5 in London and New York, ISDA
will publish a Supplement that rolls all three Supplements into one, for
ease of reference.  We will also do the same for the Commentaries. 

ISDA has received member feedback that it would be useful to update the
Definitions in 2002.  Accordingly, taking into account that the three
Supplements have already been published, we would like to receive any
additional comments that you might have on other areas of the Definitions.
Please direct your comments to Kimberly Summe at ksumme@isda.org by Friday,
January 18.  Once comments are received and reviewed, we will hold another
Credit Derivatives Market Practice Committee meeting, probably in February
2002. Details will be sent out in January 2002.

Also, as a reminder, final comments are due on the User's Guide (also to
ksumme@isda.org) by Monday, January 7, 2002.  

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"RE: 2002 IT Budgets","Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

"Last Week to Receive Early Bird Discount on Performance Based Ratemaking and Electric Power Market Performance Conferences","Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference

December 5-7, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.

 

EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.

Electric Power Market Performance Conference

December 12-14, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.

 

A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.

 

Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

*	TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear protein which, when purified and modified, greatly 
stimulates the body's immune response system.
*	Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 terminally ill AIDS patients in clinical trials show virtually no

*	TNP treated patients display virtually no side effects to treatment.
*	TNP technology is patented in 16 countries and patent pending in Canada and the U.S.
*	Treatments are far less costly and less cumbersome than currently employed alternatives.

OVERVIEW

Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize therapeutic and diagnostic systems for the treatment of 
viral diseases.  Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop and reverse the progression of HIV 
infection in humans.  After expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their core technology - TNP (Thymus 
Nuclear Protein).

Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal studies and three human clinical trials.  Each human trial 
consisted of 10 to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by intra-muscular injection bi-weekly over 
an eight week period.  Follow up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 667 days after treatment.  The trials 
revealed the following incredible results with respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:

-	HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after treatment.
-	Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which completely subsided after treatment and remained that way 
even 18 months after treatment.
-	Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no Antiviral Drug Cocktail has shown any efficacy with 
whatsoever.
-	Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP treatment.

Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide governments to commercialize the TNP technology.

Caminus and Altra Energy Partner to Create
Full-Service Trading Software Provider 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Software company Caminus Corp. (Nasdaq: CAMZ) announced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy Corp. Caminus said it would swap 1.975 shares of its stock and pay $30 million cash for Altra's software business. That values the deal at about $62 million, based on Caminus' closing price of $16.05 on Oct. 12. 

Analysis: The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry, particularly impacting those companies that are involved in the trading sector. On their own, both companies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche. Now that Caminus is acquiring Altra's software suite, which is primarily focused on the natural-gas trading sector, the synergy between the two companies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading. Essentially, Altra has two core businesses-an energy trading exchange and a software business. Caminus has entered into an agreement process to purchase only the software side of Altra. Altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily focused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operations. Together, the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greater participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges. 

Let's first establish the business models of these two companies so that we can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create. Up to the point of this partnership, Caminus and Altra were not considered direct-line competitors, as Caminus' business model focused on risk management while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions. However, there were components of the companies' businesses that certainly overlapped. Caminus Corp. has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producers trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline, TradeSpark, HoustonStreet, etc. Altra's software, which is used in the same energy trading portals, focuses on natural-gas transactions. 

Headquartered in New York, Caminus, which went public a year ago, is a provider of software solutions (and consulting services) that help a wide range of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associated with energy trading. Toward that end, the company offers two software packages:


Zai*Net software solutions, which ""enables energy organizations to effectively trade and manage energy transactions."" Zai*Net has been designed to address a wide range of energy commodities, traded instruments and associated risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and third-party systems.


Nucleus software systems, which were designed specifically to meet the trading, risk management, scheduling, and accounting needs of utilities, generating companies, power pools, gas and oil producers, processors, pipelines, and other energy market participants. In other words, the Caminus Nucleus system provides a tool for energy traders to organize, track and manage their various energy transactions from generation to end-user delivery. One of the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets and market positions in real-time and consequently determine acceptable risk levels. 

Recently, Caminus added the Storefront product, which is a Web-based trading application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce transaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet. Also, just this week at the Power Mart conference in Houston, Caminus unveiled a new software product known as FrontOffice?, which gives traders of energy physicals and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affect a portfolio before committing to the transaction. According to company reports, approximately 80 percent of Caminus' revenue comes from software license sales. In addition, Caminus also has a consulting service that focuses on risk management services for energy clients. 

One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention lately is its efforts, along with other software companies, to establish a common standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to transaction / risk management systems. A few months ago, Caminus established the Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet, and has since generated interest in some 30 companies to participate and help create universal standards for energy trading. One of the key objectives of the Standards Group is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard protocol for energy trading platforms. The technology committee is reportedly working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions. 

In September, Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp., which primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions. Under the partnership, Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointly market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing, transaction, trading, and risk management systems to create what they are calling a ""Straight-Through Processing (STP)"" environment for vertically integrated energy companies. 

By comparison, Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that provides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry. Altra reportedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market. Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of direct access load, generation dispatch, regional transmission organization (RTO) connectivity, integrated OASIS reservations, and North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) checkout and billing. Altra boasts a customer list of about 100 clients, mostly in the gas sector but also including power and multi-fuel companies. Altra's software product suite includes transaction management tools known as Altra Gas, Altra Power, Altra Pipeline and Altra Web, which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity. 

According to Caminus, the value of acquiring Altra's software suite is to create an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both gas and power traders. Further, the exchange of customers should benefit both companies. Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management services to Altra's customer base, and in turn gain the opportunity to sell Altra's new generation of systems to Caminus customers. 

The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp. In fact, Caminus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently ""exploding."" According to Caminus CEO David Stoner, the global market for wholesale energy trading, which consists of the European market, is six to eight times the size of retail markets. Consequently, a typical therm gets traded a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user. Interestingly, about 30 to 40 percent of the companies to which Caminus has provided risk management consulting services are U.S. companies attempting to expand in the European wholesale trading market. Caminus consultants helped write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) for the British government, due to be implemented by the end of 2001 or early 2002. Although smaller than the U.S. market, Britain has been experiencing privatization and various levels of deregulation since 1983, providing valuable experience and depth. Besides the U.K., Caminus has been active throughout Europe in Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and the Nordic countries through NORDPOOL. 

Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently, when fallout from the events of Sept. 11 began to impact the company's business. For 2Q 2001, Caminus reported that its total revenues increased 58 percent to $17.7 million, compared to $11.2 million for 2Q 2000. Specifically, revenues from the company's software license fees increased 61 percent to $7.5 million during the same quarter. However, for 3Q 2001, Caminus lost $369,000, or 2 cents a share, on revenue of $14.7 million, due primarily to the fact some license sales that were expected to close did not. Specifically, Caminus says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the last month of each quarter. Given the impact that the events of Sept. 11 had on many companies, a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booked as scheduled. 

Moving forward, Caminus says that the addition of Altra's software should result in an increase of its 2002 revenue guidance by about 40 percent. Caminus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its 4Q earnings to 27 cents a share, compared with a previous estimate of 23 cents a share, although analysts are still projecting 19 cents a share for the fourth quarter. 

Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies to trade and market power in new regions. However, with these opportunities come considerable risks. Hence, creating this balance between risk and opportunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus and Altra operate. However, the software market in the energy trading space is becoming increasingly competitive. Every month, new competitors in this space emerge, so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list. However, some competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Caminus / Altra are Allegro Development, KWI and SolArc (to name just a few). 

Moreover, competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum, regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state. The wholesale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the retail market, and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the wholesale market before it reaches the end user. Thus, consolidation within the energy-trading software space should continue, and I would expect Caminus to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software into its service offerings.

Clarification Statement to 10/16/01 IssueAlert on Dynegy: In its 3Q 2001 earnings statement, Dynegy reported that net income of its transmission and distribution company Illinois Power was $26 million, versus $27 million in 3Q 2000. In the 10/16 column, we incorrectly stated that Illinois Power had taken a loss of $15 million. The loss of $15 million was reported by Dynegy's telecommunications segment, which was duly noted in the article. We apologize for any confusion this error might have caused.

Conectiv Completes Nuclear Plant Sales 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from PR Newswire] Conectiv (NYSE: CIV), an energy provider located in the Mid-Atlantic, announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic City Electric Company, completed the sale of its ownership interests in three nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company. The ownership interests were sold for approximately $11.3 million, excluding reimbursement of estimated fuel inventory, subject to adjustment. 

Analysis: This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week, but I did not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on what I think is a rather significant development. The transfer of ownership in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant because of its relation to Conectiv's unique competitive strategy and the round-robin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United States. Further, despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation's nuclear facilities, we still are seeing only a small number of companies that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States. 

The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectiv's ownership in the plants, which Conectiv shares with other companies (who also happen to be the buying partners in this sale). The breakdown of the sale of nuclear assets is as follows: 

A 7.51-percent interest (164 MW) in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3 sold in equal shares to co-owners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon. Prior to the transaction, PSEG Nuclear, an indirect subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, and Exelon each owned about 46 percent of the Peach Bottom plant. Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facility. 


A 7.41-percent interest (167 MW) in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Units 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which prior to the sale owned about 50 percent of the facility. PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the plant. 


A 5-percent interest (52 MW) in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station Units 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which is the operator of the plant and prior to the sale owned 95 percent of the facility. 



As noted, the significance of these transactions relates to Conectiv's competitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear sector. Let's look at Conectiv first. 

According to Conectiv's President and COO Thomas Shaw, the divestiture of the nuclear assets is consistent with the company's focused business strategy on two core energy businesses: Conectiv Energy, the company's integrated generation and asset optimization group, and Conectiv Power Delivery, the company's regulated delivery business. To support this two-tiered focus, Conectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants to expand a generation portfolio that includes only mid-merit plants (units that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns). Mid-merit plants are often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plants and peaker units. Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to operate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy trading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to provide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they are not needed to meet higher demands for power. 

The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of baseload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conectiv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications business (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for $20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-utility electric generator, for $9 million. 

Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained ownership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region. The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to repay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. Conectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conectiv is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the money to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating Station, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natural gas. 

The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload generation supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units only) and a regulated delivery business. Conectiv Power Delivery provides energy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Given the fairly distinct line between Conectiv's regulated and unregulated businesses, I have previously speculated that Conectiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand-alone company (a trend represented by AEP, Reliant and UtiliCorp). Conectiv is in the midst of major restructuring, so it is unlikely that any such spin off of its generation business would take place in the near term. However, as far as I know, Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused exclusively on mid-merit plants. 

Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco, a partnership that is scheduled to close in April 2002. In this deal, Pepco is acquiring Conectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at $2.2 billion. Both companies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a later date. The partnership between these two relatively small and regionally based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity delivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region. By combining their two electricity delivery businesses, Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than double their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times. 

In the nuclear sector, it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG Nuclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Conectiv (despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained majority ownership in the plants). Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclear-power space, and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the license exchange on these three plants. Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, owning a total of 17 reactors. Earlier this year, Exelon CEO Corbin McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built in the next five years, and did not rule out the fact that his company might be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility. 

As noted, PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., which in 2000 was split into PSE&G, a regulated gas and electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power, an unregulated U.S. power generation company. As noted, PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek, N.J., and oversees PSEG Power's ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, located in Delta, Pa. When the Conectiv transaction is completed, PSEG Power will own 100 percent of Hope Creek, 52 percent of Salem, and 50 percent of Peach Bottom. 

In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear, Entergy Corp. is another company that deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector. Since 1999, Entergy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto the auction block. Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Units 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Entergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporation to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Entergy will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and 82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 million, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently increased its nuclear power assets. 

Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associated with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether or not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence. Exelon, for example, is involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nuclear technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). Supporters of PBMR believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short construction time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power an acceptable option. In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with the U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United States. Clearly, steps are being taken to revive this controversial industry.

The guy in the news article this morning was Kenneth J. Rice not Kenneth D. Rice of Enron fame.  The media outlet that republished the article (totaltele.com) incorrectly called SynerG's Ken Rice the former Enron Executive.  Frank and Ruth Lancaster found totaltele.com's error during a D&B/Lexus search on the company.

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting? 

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys., Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs., Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998). 

In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case that a software invention was ready for patenting when one of the inventors verbally described the invention to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it, even though the actual software used to practice the invention did not exist before the on-sale bar date. 

The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales materials that could describe details of software inventions must now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under ?102(b).

Importance:	High

Michelle and Greg's comments included - we  have approval to use the following talking points - Regards, Rj. 

Talking Points - ESTATE Employees 

?	As communicated in the December 19 OOTC email, NETCO is what we are calling the company that will be used to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership
?	You have been identified as an employee who will stay with the Enron estate.  You will not be transitioned to NETCO, once it is formed. 
?	In your role, you will be asked to perform in the interest of the estate as we continue to operate our businesses, or, if appropriate, to sell, wind down and/or close out business activities.  These activities will continue according to the instructions and control of the bankruptcy process
?	As you may know, the bankrupt estate is planning to propose a retention program and severance opportunities for employees who are critical to managing the estate.  A draft proposal has been submitted to the creditors committee for comments, and further details will be released as soon as we can provide them, which we hope will be in the coming days /weeks.  This plan will be separate from the NETCO proposals.  It is our intent to get details of this plan to you as quickly as possible
?	This may create some uncertainty for you.  However, the work you do is important to the value imbedded in the estate and its many affiliate interests. We want you to continue doing your job in operating assets or working on the wind-down as the bankruptcy reorganization process runs its course 
?	As certain wholesale functions and/or business purposes are eliminated, your employment may be terminated.  As I mentioned earlier, we have given a proposed severance policy to the creditors committee.  If that committee approves a proposal, the court then must approve it. There is typically recognition of the estate employees' commitments to the orderly reorganization and emergence of the bankrupt estate, however, there are no assurances available at this time 
?	Be assured that we will advise you of developments as soon as they can be communicated accurately.  If you have any questions or concerns about your assignment, or your role relative to the NETCO deal closure, please address those immediately with your department head or HR representatives

"York Paper Litigation","	As you might recall, York filed two summonses against Enron and Eric Holzer in two separate lawsuits' connected with the parties' dealings in the paper market. The two summonses (as allowed by Pennsylvania law) lacked any information about York's claims against Enron or Mr. Holzer. The Enron defendants removed their suits to federal court. Dechert is the Enron defendants' outside counsel.  
	We have finally received York's complaint detailing its claims against Enron and Mr. Holzer.  In a nutshell, York claims that Enron hired Holzer away from York in an effort to steal York's customer base and then, contrary to the parties' agreement and custom in the industry, proceeded to steal customers from York. Specifically, York claims that the only reason it let Holzer out of his non-compete agreement with York is because both Holzer and Enron promised: that they would honor the allegedly established practice in the paper industry preventing competitors from usurping each other's client relationships by selling paper directly to each other's clients, and that York would get new business from Enron. It is York's position that Holzer took confidential and proprietary information from York when he left that company, gave this information to Enron and that Enron and Holzer used this information to wrongfully steal York's customers. 
	York has alleged causes of action against Enron and Holzer for:
	1.	Theft of trade secrets,
	2.	Breach of contract (several counts),
	3.	Tortuous interference with contractual relations,
	4.	Tortuous interference with prospective contractual relations,
	5.	Fraudulent inducement,
	6.	Unfair competition, and 
	7.	Civil conspiracy.
	My initial impression is that York should be more worried about having agreements with its competitors preventing business solicitation then Enron should be worried about a predatory pricing claim; however, I don't know enough about the facts to have a firm view of the case. We are in the process of getting more information about these claims and I'll update you again after we have talked to our folks about this.  In the meantime, please call with any questions or comments.

Dynegy vs. Enron:
A ""Tale of Two Companies"" 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, reporting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the company's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the company's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 companies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778 people. 

Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quarter, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000. Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company and is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron employs 20,600 people. 

Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be on a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the company's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same market space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story while Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in this article are: What is Dynegy doing ""right""? What is Enron doing ""wrong""? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this ""tale of two companies""? 

Although they are often referred to as ""cross-town rivals,"" Dynegy and Enron are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-most important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 2001. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, and-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strategy is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to which the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors. 

Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similarities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decidedly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary, let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs to own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of physical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry. 

Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does not necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues. 

As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of generation and 41,600 kilometers of electric T&D lines) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled in that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewise in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, unlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its most recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint ownerships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector. 

Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, ""Dynegy's long-term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports earnings sustainability."" Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,000 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive areas. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy acquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating capacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, where it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in England. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best way to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the third quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale business. 

The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It is not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on infrastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By the same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities. 

On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly, by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential concern for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What Enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio. 

Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the ""great debate"" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall performance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband and water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trading business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay has been quick to reiterate to investors. ""Our 26-percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines,"" Lay said. ""The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."" 

Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new lines of business. Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the leadership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company ""could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital"" and that Enron ""spent too much too soon"" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter. 

Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband business compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business. 

It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydirect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional transactions. 

At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my recollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet, and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will continue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. As noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. That doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous. 

In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on its more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies.

Many thanks for your assistance yesterday. Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. because it holds a current power marketing certificate is an entity which we would like to move to being a direct subsidiary of Enron Corp. to take effect today. This is considered to be an essential part of restructuring to meet our current and future needs. 
	
While the day to day control will remain where it is and all the efforts assign contracts and other work should progress as planned, since the value to Enron Corp. is the power marketing certificate nothing should be done to jeopardize this. In addition we will be changing the charter and will need copies of the existing charter to effect those changes required.
	
Please call me if you need to discuss this further.
	
Kind regards,
	
Marcus

	Subject:	MSN

	The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.  To do that, we have to get citation issued (we are working with the court personnel to expedite this process) and serve the papers on MSN's registered agent in Austin.  We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

	Also, as the day progresses and negotiations continue, please let me know if any commercial reason arises such that you believe service should be delayed.

	I will keep you updated.

	Greg Markel, our outside counsel,  just received a phone call from Sempra's outside counsel informing him that, as a result of Enron's current financial condition, Sempra was no longer interested in pursuing a commercial resolution of the parties' disputes. Sempra's counsel said that Sempra was still interested in pursuing mediation if Enron was willing to consider paying Sempra money.

"","It is my understanding that:
After taking into account the recent preferred with Dynegy, Enron has limited authorized shares for further private equity; 
A shareholders meeting is necessary to authorize additional shares; and
A shareholders meeting requires a 30-day notice period.

In order to be safe, I think we need an additional 250 million authorized shares - in order to comfortably raise up to $2.0+ billion - although the first tranche will likely be $800 to $900 million.

Who is the right person to take the lead in this matter?

***POLL***
THIS WEEK'S POLL:
Does your company have a customer privacy policy?
Let us know!
http://www.informationsecurityworld.com/Tmpl/Archpolls.asp?CID=16

RESULTS OF LAST WEEK'S POLL:
Would you lend your biometric info to a friend?
51.4% Yes
48.6% No

***PORTAL DISCUSSION***
A recent survey has found that 56% percent of people would be willing to share their fingerprint or eyeball identification to enter public or corporate buildings, while 35% are concerned about sacrificing their privacy for better security. Why is this? 

Here's what you're saying:
""Passwords are readily transferable. You introduce biometrics to eliminate ""sharing"". This can be made impossible by storing biometrics on a secure token and implementing a token match process. No database storage required!! Then only you can access your entitlement. Simple!""

""I think somehow that you have missed the point. Using biometrics to limit administrative access on your network would work using your ""simple"" proposition but the question refers more to the problem of physical access. Maybe you can explain how creating a cookie will help if someone decides to let someone else into their office block by putting their finger in the biometric device and holding the door open for the other person to come in as well.""

Have your say:

"FW: NRG Dispute","FYI -- here is the summary of the transcripts relating to the dispute with NRG over contract formation

Subject: NRG Dispute


On Thursday afternoon, I received from NRG all of the transcripts of communications that they  recorded between the parties.  Here is my short summary:
 
There are six transcripts.  Five of them seem pretty good for us.  One is truly awful.
 
Transcript 1 (May 4, 2001):   NRG's Bill Stone talks to John Zurita about trying to come to terms on the deal.  No terms are finalized.
 
Transcript 2 (May 4, 2001):  Stone calls Zurita back and proposes a price that Zurita agrees to.  However, Zurita makes it clear that although many of the terms have been agreed to, ""obviously we have to get agreements signed and get the lawyers involved and all that good stuff.""  Stone appears to recognize that the deal is not complete:  ""So we're really not done.  Fuck.""
 
Transcript 3 (May 8, 2001):  Stone simply leave a voicemail for Chuck Decker asking to get a confirm of the deal.
 
Transcript 4 (May 8, 2001):  Stone talks to Decker.  Decker says: ""Rogers Herndon is in charge of that. Okay?  He has to put the pressure on the credit guys to get the credit shit put to bed.  His words, and they're not exact, but they're pretty close to this, I consider the deal done, tell Bill the deal is done, assuming that the back offices communicate the needed information.""  Discussions are had about getting the credit folks together to iron out details.
 
Transcript 5 (May 16, 2001) (THE BAD TAPE):  Stone calls Zurita and sets him up, asking him a number of questions aimed at determining if there really is a binding and enforceable deal between the parties.  When Stone asks ""why don't you just tell me where you guys think the deal is?,"" Zurita replies:  ""I think -- I say the deal is done.""  Stone's next question:  ""Well, let me ask a question.  What happens if gas goes to two bucks tomorrow?  Do you still consider the deal done?""  Zurita's answer:  ""Yep.""  And there's more.  Stone next asks: ""Are you guys going to stand on the deal for $70 for the five years?  I mean, I just -- I mean, I just gotta know exactly where you stand.""  Zurita's answer:  ""The deal is done, yes.""  Ouch.  This is not good.
 
Transcript 6 (May 18, 2001):  Zurita calls Stone.  They discuss credit terms.  Stone makes several comments that indicate he realizes the deal is not done. (""The only thing, the only thing I care about is how long it's going to take to have the agreement worked out""); (""What is my concern is how far away are theyfrom getting done?"").
 
Rogers, I am interested in your views after you have had an opportunity to review the tapes.  Let's talk soon.  For you others, please let me know if you want transcripts of the tapes.  
 
Andy
 
P.S. --  Under the agreement we reached with NRG for exchange of the tapes, we must trade position papers with NRG on October 25, 2001.  I will prepare the position paper later this week.

Jeff, we are finally in  the position to sell our interest in Energoville today. Any chance, to get this resolution done for a sale today?

We have been negotiating this sale for a very very long time and this is quite literally our one and only shot at it - given that our reps and warranties had now gone away, this price is the best we can possibly get for it (we once hoped to get EUR 2.1 million)

"FW: ENRON EUROPE","
I am copying to you my note of last night to Mark and Rob. 

Email correspondence has been exchanged concerning support letters for EES companies in the UK, but the issue impacts all UK companies and also (given minor differences in legal regimes) those in all other European jurisdictions. 

Hopefully the conclusion now is that Corp feels able to give the standard support letters, and the additional comfort referred to in my note below. The consequences of Corp not being able to are fairly dire. 

Thanks.

Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

"RE: Tomizawa","Dear Alan,
 
As per below, Caroline is going to send off a blank contract this afternoon to Yoshimi.
 
I have only one concern and it relates to the Jim Derrick and Mark Haedicke approval - condition subsequent to the contract.  
 
If we get the go ahead from Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman by Friday, and if Yoshimi accepts our offer and signs the contract and rejects Cargill's offer, is it possible that Jim and Mark, in making their determination, would take into consideration any issues beyond her personally I wonder?
 
What I am trying to get a feel for (and I am not meaning to be rude or insulting) is, is it possible in your view that management could see this as another way of getting out of the contract with Yoshimi if bad turns to worse for the company.  The thing is that I know she is ready to take Cargill's offer.  If she rejects them, having accepted our offer and then Jim / Mark turn her down because of big picture stuff, this would be very unfortunate for her.
 
Please don't misunderstand my question, I know that Jim / Mark don't tend to turn people down at all after they have been through the recruitment process, but the company is at the same time facing an unprecedented set of circumstances so it is worth checking this I think.
 
Thanks.
 
Jane

Hi Caroline,
 
Have discussed this with Joe.
 
He wants you to send Yoshimi a draft contract without figures and have you give her the figures we are proposing over the phone as soon as possible.
 
Would be great if we could do this today.
 
We will think about the EP thing again tomorrow after we see where we are.

This lady has written to most of the senior executives in the company trying to recover some of the money which we believe her husband misappropriated from Enron in Hong Kong. Matt Lee obtained orders freezing the husband's bank accounts and he immediately repaid us.

We have written at least twice explaining we are not prepared to pay any of this back. I'll ask Matt to do so again one last time.

"CAISO/Calpine","Wade here are the wiring instructions for two payments, one to the CAISO and one to Calpine:

CAISO:

$206,000

This amount represents two days' A/S and GMC charges, plus enough money to bring replenish the ""3-day buffer.""


Calpine:

$1,980,800

This represents two days' worth of energy to serve our California load.  Our price was $40/MWh.  


By purchasing this energy from Calpine instead of the CAISO, we saved $120/MWh ($60/MWh + $100/MWh underscheduling penalty).

This is a savings of approximately $6 million over the next two days.

All,

We had a preliminary meeting on Friday.  The attached is a summary of the matrix we developed as well as changes from subsequent e-mails.  Note, only one name has been placed in the matrix where two may have been suggested - if the name is not correct then please e-mail me back as soon as possible - only person per box please.  The names placed in the matrix will be directly responsible to the estate.

We need to meet Monday to: (1) agree on the matrix; (2) develop detailed processes for capturing value (trade books, structured deals, hard assets and business sales); (3) understand the approval process required on a go forward basis; (4) develop compensation / retention program for estate, (5) address any administrative concerns.

If you have not done so, please check the names in the matrix to ensure that they are correct and please send me any changes as well as their full names to be utilized for future e-mails.

Regards,

Jim

"Message from Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman","

Management Committee Members:

In light of today's meeting being canceled, we would like for you to give consideration to Jeff Huff as a candidate for Commercial Support VP.  Jeff has interviewed with Mark Frevert, Ray Bowen and Steve Kean who have given favorable feedback.  At this time, we would like to proceed with an offer.  Please contact us with any concerns or questions by the close of business Thursday.  If we have no opposing votes, we will proceed.

Below are a few points and a resume for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been working at Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff

"RE: Eletrobolt/Cuiaba Closing Issues","For your info.  I am hammering these constantly,  as well as closing the LDC negotiation and selling Eletrobolt power to the government.  In our discussions today with BNDES they committed to resolving the open points for Cuiaba, and to finalize the proposal for Eletrobolt generation and the LDC issues by Wednesday next week,  but it is slow going.

Orlando;
Sorry.  I realized last night I had forgot.  We can send you an OPIC
brochure with the pricing tables included but the relevant section shows
under a category called institutional loans and leases and the subheading is
expropriation cover.  The range of pricing quoted is .40 to .90 annually
i.e. 40 to 90 basis points annually.  OPIC typically requires the annual
premium to be paid in advance.

I will try to track down the Electrobolt points today.

Barbara Boehm  Please fed ex an OPIC blue program handbook to Orlando.

Orlando;

Attached is a first draft of the BNDES letter for your input.  We have not
reviewed it with KfW as I understand they may wish to maintain a passive
role in this for now.  We will keep them posted.

The list for Electrobolt is still in preparation and will be sent out
tomorrow AM our time.

STRONG BUY
Target Price: 54.00 (US$)
Dynegy Inc. (DYN)
ENE Deal Shows Risk Coverage & Est & Valuation Upside

Summary

After the close on Friday, DYN confirmed that it would acquire Enron (ENE, 8.63,
Strong Buy) for 0.2685 DYN shares plus assumption of debt and an equity infusion
of $2.5 billion. This values ENE at $10.40 per share based on DYN's Friday
close.

Our initial analyses show the merger to be additive to pro-forma '02 eps for DYN
by 25% to $3.25-$3.30 vs our current estimate of $2.55. We estimate the deal
multiples as about 7x '02 eps, 3.2x '02 cash flow, 0.85x book value and 5x
EV/EBITDA based on our revised '02 estimates for ENE.

We would note that DYN has projected a pro-forma '02 of $3.40-$3.50 per share
before cost savings and synergies.

We expect the deal to close in 9-12 months pending reviews by the SEC, FTC, FERC
and state PSCs. Despite the size of the combined company, we do not expect major
divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and
the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.

In a report dated Nov 5, we valued ENE at $31 per share. In our view, the deal
valuation includes a differential of $20 per share or $17 billion to account for
ENEs related party and accounting issues. Because these issues threatened ENEs
core businesses, the timing and valuation of the deal for DYN is extraordinarily
attractive. We consider alternate bids for ENE to be possible under these
circumstances.

We expect DYN and other energy merchants to benefit from the removal of risk
that ENE would be downgraded below investment grade or file for bankruptcy
protection.

Pending additional information from conference calls, analyst meetings and other
deal related filings; we are maintaining our reported eps ests for DYN of $2.10
for '01 and $2.55 for '02. Our ENE ests are $1.80 for '01 and $1.60 for '02.
These estimates assume the deal closes in 4Q'02.

anticipate growth rate and valuation benefits for DYN that will result in
increasing our estimates and target price as the deal moves closer to closing.

"Bank of England Application","Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received an
application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we have
considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,
consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives
activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely
to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have
generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark
and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have even
admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we
let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA
materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there
may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.
 
In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been expressed
if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for membership.
These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the
regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to
influence the process.
 
Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of
England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has
correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional
central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market
and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA. 
 
In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously
expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the
application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received
an application.
 
Please share your views with the other members of the Board.
 
Bob

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"Adv: Reduce outside counsel fees, increase in-house expertise","Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys

As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of ""reinventing the wheel"", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!
al!
ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.

LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality. Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  LRSolutions' attorneys truly enjoy doing research, and analyzing complex legal issues.  In addition, we work with our network of legal experts that include hundreds of the nation's premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized intuitively into areas of specialty. Only experts in the field can produce a product in the most efficient manner, without 
missing crucial issues and predict ultimate cost.  Now, for a predetermined, fixed price, you can combine legal expertise with enormous cost savings.  Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com.

Our products and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials such as appellate briefs and court filings, regulatory handbooks and manuals in every conceivable area of law (enabling your company to better manage risk and raise legal awareness), contract and other document drafting, settlement packages, and listings of relevant authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and objective that best suits your needs.  We can work with your outside counsel as part of your overall legal team, or provide an alternative to utilization of outside counsel as well as support for in-house projects.

If you would like to contact me by phone, please feel free to call at 1-800-627-8047, ext. 1.  Again, our website is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.  I am convinced that LRSolutions will be a critical and welcome long-term resource for your legal department as you attempt to deal with today's uncertain business climate, and I greatly look forward to speaking with you.

	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.

Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

I received a call from Marty Rosenberg at Sithe.  He stated that Sithe is interested in purchasing our equity interest in Sithe Independence and the note we received in exchange for the tracking account.  His parameters were:

12% discount rate on the note;
15% discount rate on equity;
Exelon Board approval would be required;
There were some tax issues to be problem solved; and
Closing by Christmas.

On a back of the envelope, I think there offer is probably over $300 million in cash, but may have some significant book loss implications.

Chuck, with assistance from Todd, please lead the analysis and let's review the numbers.  Then let's get the group together to determine how to respond.

"RE: POAs","Sami:

Please let me know the names of the people to be appointed to represent the Caycos in Brazil.  As a suggestion, I think that we have been appointing the following people on the POAs:  Orlando Gonzalez, Brett Wiggs, John Novak and you.

I will be happy to prepare the POAs--please confirm that you need them ONLY for the second group of companies listed below.  Currently I am involved in the CEG closing which should take place Monday and Tuesday, November 26 and 27.  (Also,  the office will be closed Thursday and Friday this week for the Thanksgiving Holiday.)  I will be able to focus on the POAs after that.  As you are likely aware, it will require the preparation of two sets of resolutions and POAs for each limitada.  Once the POAs are signed, and the we receive the check from accounting to pay the fees at the Brazilian consulate, the POAs will be at the consulate for 3-5 days.  Therefore, I would expect that if everything goes smoothly we could get them to you by sometime around December 7 or December 10.

If you need them before that date, perhaps we can find someone who can help me by preparing the documents for each company from a basic draft, which I already in a form which is very close to what we'll need.  

Please call me at ext. 66197 in Houston if you wish to discuss the schedule.

Hope all's well with you,

Nancy

Many thanks for your assistance yesterday. Clinton Energy Management Services, Inc. because it holds a current power marketing certificate is an entity which we would like to move to being a direct subsidiary of Enron Corp. to take effect today. This is considered to be an essential part of restructuring to meet our current and future needs. 
	
While the day to day control will remain where it is and all the efforts assign contracts and other work should progress as planned, since the value to Enron Corp. is the power marketing certificate nothing should be done to jeopardize this. In addition we will be changing the charter and will need copies of the existing charter to effect those changes required.
	
Please call me if you need to discuss this further.

"Good news from Brazil","
Thought you could use some good news!

CUIABA  (not typically associated with ""good news"")

1. GT12  is repaired and running:    Commissioning on gas is complete for purposes of the PPA which avoids a default (yippee!).  GT11 is still on schedule to be repaired by December 3, 2001.

2.  Consent signed:  Both Furnas and Electrobras (the guarantor) have now signed the consent, and aditivo #5 whereby Furnas will take on the risk associated with new regulatory issues and pass those costs through to end users.  ANEEL has approved but still must formally ratify this plan.  Thus, we are getting closer to financial close by year end.  The issues of political force majeure and the survival of the Electrobras guaranty are still under negotiation with the Brazilian government. It is unclear at this time how the recent turn of events at Enron will impact the financing. 

3.  Shell:  The mediation was temporarily suspended a day early.  The parties will consider Shell swapping its interest in Cuiaba for Enron assets GTB, TBG and Transredes.    The parties are determining whether this swap makes sense and, depending on the outcome,  will reconvene either to negotiate the swap or continue the mediation.  This dispute must be settled to close financing.

4.  Insurance:  Reservation of rights letter to be issued as a result of Siemens report that the row 3 cracks first appeared in 1999, but Siemens advised the Owner they were ""normal"" and thus the plant should continue to run. We are covered for our own negligence but still no final word on coverage.  All information requested by underwriters has been provided, including Siemens' correspondence advising the Owner that the cracks were not material.

ANNEX V

Orlando Gonzales met with Brazilian officials again last week and advised that he is very close to negotiating a satisfactory agreement  on Annex V.  He requested that we not file any suits at this time. 

Regards,
        Michelle

Subject:	FW: New restructuring pictures for Electrobolt

Mark - in answer to your questions, the restructuring of the ownership chain for the Electrobolt power project is being done at OPIC's request - to make it easier for OPIC to exercise its remedies under the contemplated project financing structure.  The Americas tax team will also realize a few efficiencies.  We have obtained consents from our construction lenders to finalize the restructuring before OPIC comes in later this year. 

The attached slides show the steps.  The top tier ""Brazilian Power Development Trust"" is a Delaware business trust with a 97/3 structure in which John Hancock is the equity.  The debt is syndicated; WestLB is the Lender Agent.  

This restructuring does not increase any risks to Enron, the lending banks, or the equity.  It is an administrative concession to OPIC, with some tax benefits to us.   

I am available to answer any other questions you may have. 

Thanks,

Rose

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

ISDA Publishes Credit Publishes Credit Derivatives Convertibles Supplement
ISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001
<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>

NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association announced today that it has finalized and published the
Supplement Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations.
The Supplement and Commentary can be accessed under the What's New section
of the ISDA's web site. 

The Convertibles Supplement addresses the treatment under the 1999 ISDA
Credit Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and
exchangeable obligations, as well as the treatment of accreting obligations,
such as zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and
non-discounted bonds that accrete during their term.  ""The Convertibles
Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in
the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio managers, credit
protection sellers and dealers,"" said Robert G. Pickel, Executive Director
and CEO of ISDA.


ISDA Debuts Credit Derivatives Number at $631.5 billion in OTC Market Survey
ISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001
<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>

NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) announced today that the global notional outstanding
volume of credit derivatives transactions was $631.497 billion for the first
half of 2001. While still modest in relation to interest rate products, this
figure is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to more
mature derivative product areas.

Polling member firms for the first time on credit derivatives transactions,
ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit
default swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to ten credits, and portfolio
transactions of ten credits and more. 83 ISDA member firms supplied data on
these products. Interest rate and currency derivatives growth was 3.573% in
the first half of the year among members that also reported to ISDA at
year-end 2000. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes increased
from $53.267 trillion to $55.170 trillion. Total notional principle of
interest rate swaps, interest rate options and currency swaps for all
surveyed firms dipped to $57.305 trillion from $63.009 trillion last year.
Among top ten dealers, there was also a minor decrease in volume from
$35.648 trillion to $35.532 trillion.

""Shifting product use is a reflection of a more uncertain global market
environment,"" said Thomas K. Montag, Vice-Chairman of ISDA and Chair of the
Association's Market Survey Committee. ""The market for credit protection has
an obvious appeal during times of economic downturn,"" said Mr Montag, a

Supranational Studies First Use Of Credit Derivatives 
Derivatives Week - November 12, 2001

The European Investment Bank, a multinational lender with a EUR215 billion
(USD192 billion) loan portfolio, is considering using credit derivatives for
the first time as a means of hedging its credit risks next year. Officials
at the EIB in Luxembourg said the lender is currently conducting an internal
review on the credit derivatives market and is weighing whether it makes
sense to use products such as single-name default swaps to mitigate risk.
""Credit [derivatives] would be a completely new field for us,"" said Luis
Pacheco, an official in the credit-risk department in Luxembourg, noting the
bank has used foreign exchange swaps in the past on the back of its bond
offerings but has not used any derivatives on its loan portfolio. 

The lender hands out EUR36 billion per year, EUR30 billion of which is
within the European Union, to highly rated banks and corporates. Two-thirds
of the loans go to highly-rated banks with credit ratings in the A range
with maturities of 15-25 years, which then loan money to small and
medium-sized enterprises. The remaining third goes to corporates across the
credit spectrum in five to 15-year tenors. 

Pacheco said the EIB will accept default swaps in place of bank guarantees,
which it now requires as a means of hedging risk on the bulk of its
long-term lending, if the market is deemed liquid enough. Officials were
unable to quantify potential usage of credit derivatives given the early
stage of the discussions. 

Credit derivatives pros were excited to hear of the EIB's discussions. ""It's
just a matter of time until the credit derivatives market becomes more like
the interest-rate swaps market and what we're seeing now is the initial
phase,"" said one trader, adding, ""I'm not surprised."" 

Pacheco and other EIB officials said the reason behind the review is because
the default swap market is more liquid and as a result may offer more
attractive pricing for debtors. ""The advantage is the portfolio approach,""
commented one official. The EIB has considered using credit derivatives in
the past, although it found ""the market was not developed enough and so we
were not interested,"" said Pacheco. The supranational is analyzing the
market now to see if that has changed in terms of liquidity and critical
mass in the last year as is expected. ""Now we want to see the new situation
of the market and to see if we can use it in our business,"" he said. He
declined comment on potential counterparties. 


Basle study suggests changes to the Accord
IFR - November 10, 2001

Banks could face higher capital charges under Basle II's internal ratings
based (IRB) foundation approach to credit risk reserving than its more
advanced, standardised approach.

Contrary to the Baste Committee on Banking Supervision's desired results,
the IRB foundation approach's minimum capital requirements would be 14%
higher among large G-1O banks, the regulators' quantitative impact study
(QIS) found.

Under the standardised approach, these banks would see their requirements
increase 6% on average. An average change of - 5% was reached when banks
were asked to calibrate credit risk using the IRB advanced approach laid out
in the Committee's January proposal, according to the QIS released last
week.

To address the fact that the approach slated as the less intensive yielded
higher charges, and to understand better the impact that the January
proposal would have on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the
Committee is conducting a follow-on impact study.

The January proposal's corporate and retail risk weight curves and its
method for recognition of physical collateral and receivables may be
modified as a result of this study, the regulator said last week. The
January draft was not balanced because it was biased towards the views of
large banks engaged in large corporate lending activities, noted one
industry official.

The corporate risk weight curve under the new QIS is likely to reduce the
capital requirements for many SME borrowers relative to the January
proposal, the Committee said. Additional work is also under way aimed at
assessing the probable impact of applying separate risk weight curves for
residential mortgage exposures and for other retail exposures. Under the
Committee's January proposal, the IRB approach treated all retail exposures
using the same risk weight curve.

The impact of assuming a 45% loss-given default (LGD) for loans fully
secured by non-property physical collateral and a 40% LCD for loans fully
secured by receivables will be examined in the new QIS.  ""Under the January
proposal banks with the foundation approach have no incentive to use most
forms of collateral,"" said Marc Intrater, managing director at Oliver, Wyman
in New York.

Other than commercial and residential property collateral, the January
proposal did not recognise physical collateral or trade receivables as
collateral. As such, loans fully secured by either received a 50% LGD. Banks
that use collateral for their secured lending and do it well generally
experience a reduction in credit risk. The Committee's decision to undertake
a follow-up impact exercise is widely viewed as revisionist, say market
participants. Similar moves earlier this year appear poised to result in
changes to the January proposal, they note.

""There is a lot of waiting until the final accord. But most banks realise
that even though the accord does not come into effect until 2005, getting
ready for it requires a lot of lead time,"" said Intrater. The Baste
Committee plans to release a final version of its proposed accord in
February.

Subject:	In re F&J Representation
Importance:	High



	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

"FW: Sithe distribution in December","FYI.

Subject:	Sithe distribution in December

So we received a December distribution from Sithe (a whopping 5,773,015.15).  This is for the TCC and Equity distribution.  We also were paid the first interest installment on December 1 (another 14,715,082)  So total we have received over $23 million this year (and we didn't make the $2.75 million payment to DYN on Dec 1).  Much better than proforma.  Interestingly the TCC adjustment for the October and November reduced Sithe's distribution by nearly $2 million.  OUCH.  Chuck

"Sempra Damages","	Yesterday we received a supplement to the plaintiffs' discovery that contained a damage report from the plaintiffs' damage experts. 
	Plaintiffs are claiming $71 million.  This number takes into account the amounts allegedly lost from breach through March 2002, the date the plaintiffs claim they will have both machines up and running. More specifically, this number is based on:
	1.	The alleged actual costs associated with moving, operating and using the machine that was moved back to Somerset. ($12 million for 2001/ $5 million for 1/02-3/02- Total $17million)
	2.	Lost tax credits ""grossed-up"" for the machine that remained at Pier IX but, according to plaintiffs, was unable to make any synfuel because the plaintiffs purportedly could not get the coal to operate it. ($54 million)
	By only using the period from breach through March 2002, the plaintiffs have avoided having to make any assumptions about the spread and also have avoided having to take into account any long-term cost-savings that Enron's alleged breach provided which, we argue, they would have to apply to offset their early damages.
	We are analyzing the plaintiffs' numbers and will get back to you.

(1)	I have not yet been able to ascertain whether (i) the AA review or any statement in respect thereof is required to be filed with the SEC, or (ii) if not so required, ENE would file the 10-Q without having obtained the review.  

(2)	ENE's 364-day corporate revolver (and most other ENE instruments containing the subject covenant) requires ENE to make available either on ""EDGAR"" or ENE's home page on World Wide Web, or otherwise make available to the Banks promptly after the filing or sending thereof, and in any event within 75 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters, a copy of ENE's report on Form 10-Q.  If ENE does not file the 10-Q, it arguably could nevertheless send it to the banks as confidential information (to comply with Regulation FD) within the required time period and satisfy the covenant.  The revolver contains a confidentiality provision.
Failure to deliver the 10-Q constitutes an Event of Default under the revolver if the failure continues for more than 30 days after ENE has received notice thereof by the Paying Agent.

I will continue to pursue information from the accountants.

"2001 Management Conference","
During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

If you decide that you'd like to have an update re that status of the new
Ontario electricity market, I'd be happy to do so.  It won't take more than
2-3 minutes, as nothings changed dramatically since July.  All parties are
proceeding on the assumption that the market will open in the Spring (a
specific date has not yet been established).    

If, however, anyone has any specific questions that they'd like to have
discussed, perhaps they can add them to the agenda in advance of the meeting

(Meeting details will be circulated to the entire Committee today but  I
have attached them for your information).

We are in the process of finalizing the agenda, which will largely focus on
documentation initiatives to address standardizing netting provisions across
energy commodities and to also address physical and financial trading.
However, I wanted to ask if there are any Canadian energy issues we should
include on the agenda.  Would you let me know your thoughts?  Meg gave an
update on the Ontario Electricity Market at the July 27 meeting -- is an
update in order for the Nov. 2 meeting?  Thank you. -- Stacy

Updates on Enron / Dynegy Merger, SCE Rescue Plan and Muni Vote in San Francisco


By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[Today's column includes analysis on three separate news items.] 

EnronOnline and Dynegydirect to Merge 

[News item from Energy Info Source] Online energy trading EnronOnline will merge with smaller rival Dynegydirect after its parent company Enron Corp. agreed to a $9-billion takeover by Dynegy Inc. The integration of the two platforms will take about six to nine months, Dynegy said. In the meantime, the two will continue to operate separately. On both EnronOnline and Dynegydirect, traders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy, respectively. 

Analysis: This is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging integration of the various businesses between Dynegy and Enron. Although the merger makes sense for both companies, especially considering Enron's financial instability and its limited options at this juncture, it must be acknowledged that the two companies have very different corporate cultures, and the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task. The companies have developed two distinct approaches to online trading, as illustrated by their independent electronic exchanges. Although it will be interesting to see how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate their two separate customer accounts, one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegydirect have in common is that they rely on principal-based transactions. 

It is important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when it developed EnronOnline, the first electronic-trading exchange, well ahead of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydirect about a year later. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 billion in notional value. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional transactions. Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnline, led by electricity and natural gas, but also including bandwidth and paper. EnronOnline is a proprietary trading exchange. In other words, in every transaction that takes place on EnronOnline, Enron participates as either a buyer or a seller. 

Dynegydirect was launched in October 2000, a year after EnronOnline became operational. Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline, although it is growing. The exchange recorded nearly $10 billion in transactions in the third quarter. Like EnronOnline, Dynegydirect is also principal-based. In other words, Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions, either as a buyer or a seller. Unlike EnronOnline, which is completely online, Dynegydirect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the telephone. It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became involved in two different kinds of online trading. The first is the proprietary, one-to-many format on Dynegydirect, in which Dynegy participates in all transactions as either a buyer or a seller. The second venue is an anonymous, many-to-many format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple buyers and sellers. This operation takes place on TradeSpark. Dynegy had previously invested $25 million in eSpeed, the trading systems developer that created the infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates. 

As a whole, the online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a major growth spurt. A study conducted by AMR Research showed that 600 energy-trading exchanges existed in April 2000. This number grew to 1,500 by September 2001. A separate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that online trading in wholesale markets increased 750 percent from 1999 to 2000. The same report projects that online trading volume will continue to grow, leaping from a $400-billion market in 2000 to a $3.6-trillion market in 2005. Without question, the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a market edge in many sectors of the energy industry, including the online trading market. 


SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan 

[News item from Energy Info Source] A federal judge on Nov. 9 refused to delay a settlement between Southern California Edison (SCE) and state regulators designed to allow the utility to recover $3.3 billion of its debts and to keep it from bankruptcy. U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying the deal, as requested by a consumer group, would risk harming the state's second-largest utility, its creditors and the public. Judge Lew, who approved the settlement on Oct. 5, called the arguments for a stay advanced by consumer group The Utility Reform Network (TURN) ""repetitive"" and ""without merit."" 

Analysis: This is a victory for SCE in the painstaking process of establishing a rescue plan for the utility with the state of California. Two weeks ago, a federal appeals court had temporarily blocked a settlement between SCE and state power regulators that would keep electric rates at record highs for the next two years. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted TURN two weeks to argue against the settlement. The settlement would help SCE, the state's second-largest utility, pay more than half of its estimated $6-billion debt by continuing to charge Edison customers higher rates imposed last May. The judge's decision now has blocked any additional counter claims by TURN, at least on the current judicial level, and it appears that SCE is free to move forward with its CPUC-endorsed rescue plan. 

It is important to note that the original settlement deal between SCE and the state of California emerged out of negotiations that had taken place between SCE and the CPUC in an effort to resolve previous litigation. SCE had sued state regulators at the CPUC after they refused to allow the utility to raise rates and recover billions of dollars it had spent buying power on behalf of customers at soaring prices in the wholesale market. SCE's lawsuit argued that the regulators broke federal law and unconstitutionally took its property by not letting it bill customers for the full cost of their electricity. At the present time, SCE's total debt is marked at about $6.35 billion in power procurement-related liabilities due to state law that prohibited it from recovering the high costs of wholesale electricity through retail electric rates. Under the agreement reached between SCE and the CPUC, SCE would be allowed to pay down about $3 billion of its back debt of $6.35 billion. 

In exchange for being protected from bankruptcy proceedings, SCE agreed to a rate freeze and a promise by utility executives to not pay shareholders a dividend until the debt is paid off. SCE's rates were raised by approximately 42 percent in 2001 and will remain frozen through 2003 unless the utility pays off its debts sooner. In exchange, SCE agreed it would use cash on hand and any revenue beyond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pay off its old debts; pay no dividends on its common stock through 2003 or until its back debts are fully paid; and drop a lawsuit against state regulators claiming the CPUC had violated federal law by failing to raise retail rates to reflect the underlying cost of wholesale power. From its perspective, officials at Edison International (the parent company of SCE) expressed confidence that the settlement deal would allow the utility to accumulate enough cash and gain financing by the middle of the first fiscal quarter of 2002 to pay its debt to banks, bondholders and power generators. 


Tally of Absentee Ballots Changes San Francisco Municipalization Vote 

[News item from Reuters] Two ballot measures aimed at establishing a public power system in San Francisco and unplugging utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. have gone down in defeat, officials said on Nov. 12. 

Analysis: The tally of absentee ballots in the Nov. 6 municipalization vote in San Francisco changed at least part of the outcome in this election. As noted in a previous IssueAlert, Proposition I, which sought to set up a Municipal Utility District in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane, was defeated. However, originally it was believed that the separate measure known as Proposition F, which would have established a Municipal Water and Power Agency in San Francisco alone, had passed by a slim margin. Upon counting the absentee ballots, the San Francisco Department of Elections announced that this measure was defeated by a scant 533 votes. 

Obviously, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is quite pleased with the revised outcome of this election. In response to the finalized vote, representatives from the utility said, ""This outcome affirms that there is no strong sentiment in favor of the takeover of PG&E's distribution system in San Francisco."" There may be some validity to this statement, considering that one could argue that with the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric and the recent California energy crisis, conditions could have favored a pro-municipalization vote, and yet the measure still failed. However, let's not forget that it was defeated by only 533 votes, which indicates that the issue regarding the establishment of a public power system in the area is far from over. 

The defeat of the municipalization issue in San Francisco can be attributed to several factors. First, it must be acknowledged that PG&E Corp., the parent company of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric, spent about $1 million on advertising to defeat the measure. However, arguably voters responded to claims by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. that the municipalization plan was unrealistic. The utility claimed that a (MUD) Municipal Utility would be ill-equipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & Electric has managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be able to compete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD would have to purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also buy wholesale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which represent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run.

I understand you may get a call from Steve Kean about these Q and As.  I've sent copies to Tim Detmering (to get comments on the business side) and to Lance, Scott Wulfe, Joe Dilg, Shelley Barber and John Ale on the legal side (and several others).  I've also asked VE to prepare something for us to send to our employees that addresses what we can and can't say or do in terms of sharing information with Rockne (from an anti-trust and confidentiality standpoint).  It would be great if Richard Sanders or Bob Williams could help on this.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Italy rebuts claims over swap contract
Financial Times (North American Edition) - November 5, 2001
By James Blitz 

The Italian Treasury firmly rebutted allegations on Monday that it had
structured a complicated swaps contract with the aim of deflating its 1997
budget deficit figure and qualifying for the single European currency. 

In a formal statement, the Treasury said that swap contracts - in which a
bond issuer can trade his obligation to make payments in one currency rather
than another - were a regular method of ""improving management of public
debt"". 

Privately, meanwhile, Treasury officials sought to explain why Italy had
undertaken a swap contract highlighted over the weekend by a report for the
International Securities Market Association. 

On May 15 1995 the Italian government issued a bond for Y200bn. At the time,
after the dramatic 1992 devaluation of the lira, the Italian Treasury was
gradually seeking to regain credibility in international markets, and did so
by issuing bonds in a range of currencies. 

When the Y200bn bond was issued, the yen-lira exchange rate was at L19.3. By
December 1996, however, the yen had depreciated by 30 per cent to a level of
L13.4 to the yen. The Treasury then sought to lock in its currency gains
over this period. 

Treasury officials say they could have undertaken to start buying back the
Y200bn bond issue, but given its sheer size, this was unrealistic. They
therefore decided to undertake a cross-currency swap in which the Treasury
could convert its yen liabilities into lira. 

The Treasury faced a serious technical problem, however. Under European
Union statistical rules pertaining at the time, the debt of all EU countries
could only be reported in the original currency in which the bonds had been
issued, in this case yen. 

Any swap contract agreed by the Treasury in order to close its foreign
exchange risk would thus be irrelevant when it came to calculating the
overall debt figure. 

This was highly pertinent to how the swap agreement had to be structured. 

The Italian Treasury could have simply closed the swap transaction when the
Y200bn bond matured in September 1998, realising all its exchange rate gains
at that date. But a strong appreciation of the yen during the course of 1997
might have left Italy's official debt looking higher at the end of that year
than it did at the end of 1996. This could have seriously undermined the
country's bid to enter the eurozone. 

The Treasury therefore needed to keep the formal calculation of its debt
consistent by realising their exchange rate gain during the lifetime of the
bond. Both the exchange rate and the interest rate of the swap contract were
structured to allow this. 

Treasury officials say the 30 per cent foreign exchange gain from the Y200bn
bond was highly unusual. They dismissed any notion that this could be a
regular phenomenon in debt management as absurd. 

Nor, say officials, could the swap be judged as a way of ""window dressing""
the deficit figure. If window dressing had taken place, Italy would have
seen its deficit and debt shoot up after it had successfully entered the
single currency. The fact remains that Italy's deficit and debt have both
been on a steadily downward path since 1996.

Rome 'did not cheat over deficit' 
Financial Times - November 6, 2001 (European Edition)
By Peter Norman

The European Commission and Eurostat, the European Union's statistical
agency, yesterday rejected suggestions that Italy had used the
over-the-counter derivatives market to camouflage the true size of its
budget deficit and so help its admission to the European single currency. 

Gerassimos Thomas, spokesman for Pedro Solbes, the economic and monetary
affairs commissioner, said the Commission's preliminary evaluation was that
the use of interest rate swap transactions by one member state in 1997, as
highlighted in an International Securities Market Association (ISMA) report,
did not amount to cheating on the budget deficit figures. 

Mr. Thomas said the purpose of such swap transactions was to save money for
governments and they were therefore not discouraged by regulators. Although
the ISMA report referred only to an unnamed member state, it was understood
to be Italy. 

Yves Franchet, the director-general of Eurostat, said his agency knew in
1997 about the Y200bn Italian bond issue and swap transaction mentioned
anonymously in the report. The effect of that deal was to reduce Italy's
deficit of around 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1997 by a
marginal 0.02 percentage points. 

The swap deal was therefore not of a size to influence significantly Italy's
ability to produce a deficit well below the 3 per cent ceiling set in the
Maastricht Treaty. 

Mr. Franchet said Eurostat consulted widely on how to treat swaps before
defining the deficit of Italy and other member states. The agency had to
work out the public deficits of member states for economic and monetary
union at a time of statistical transition between national accounts based on
a standard known as ESA79, which took no account of swaps, and before formal
adoption of the ESA95 system, which recognised swaps. 

After consulting with expert committees, Eurostat decided to apply the ESA95
standard in calculating member states' suitability for Emu. Aware that swaps
could have a positive or negative effect on deficits, Eurostat also
conducted a survey of swap use by member states. According to Mr. Franchet,
the practice was not widespread. 

Cavallo defends Argentina's plan for debt swap 
Financial Times - November 6, 2001
By Thomas Catan

Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday mounted a defence
of his country's controversial debt swap plan, saying investors must accept
lower interest payments if his country was to avoid an outright default on
its Dollars 132bn debt. 

""Any reasonable person knows that Argentina cannot grow if it has to pay
interest on its debt that ranges between 11 per cent to 25 per cent - and in
the case of some provinces, up to 30 per cent a year,"" he told an audience
of businessmen. 

""We . . . seek to ensure payment on the basis that Argentina is viable and
to stop trying to pay (interest rates) that only reflect the march of
Argentina towards default. It's a question of telling the truth."" 

Starting today, Argentina will offer private creditors new bonds backed by
future tax revenues that will pay a maximum of 7 per cent. Repayment on
bonds coming due in the next 10 years will also be pushed forward by three
years, Mr. Cavallo said. 

This leg of the debt restructuring appears to be aimed mainly at domestic
investors - local pension funds, insurance companies and banks - that hold
at least a third of Argentina's Dollars 95bn in bonds. These local
institutions, often units of international banks, are heavily exposed to
Argentine debt and are seen as more susceptible to government pressure. 

A second ""global exchange"" for all of Argentina's bonds should be ready
within 2-4 months, Mr. Cavallo said. By then, Argentine officials hope to
have additional guarantees from multilateral lending agencies to offer
foreign investors in return for accepting lower-interest bonds. Argentina
hopes this will enable it to avoid an outright default on its debt. 

Investors entering the first, mainly local, exchange will be entitled to
enter any subsequent deal, Mr. Cavallo said. Pension fund managers had
feared being taken to court by future retirees for having acted against
their interests. 

""Those who have confidence in Argentina are going to have two opportunities
because no one knows if the global exchange will have better or worse
terms,"" Mr. Cavallo said. 

Argentina is attempting to cut its annual interest bill by at least Dollars
4bn to free up resources to restart its ailing economy, now in its fourth
year of recession. To do so, the government is implementing a range of tax
cuts and other measures to spark spending, such as cutting employees'
private pension contributions. 

Investors remain concerned that Argentina's debt proposal effectively
constitutes a default. However, Mr. Cavallo is now putting them on notice
that they must accept lower interest payments if the country is to continue
to service its debt.  The government is also pressing the 23 provinces to
accept a cut in their guaranteed monthly tax transfers.

After Liffe
The Economist - November 1, 2001

JEAN-FRANCOIS THEODORE, the head of Euronext, is a surprise winner. The
London Stock Exchange (LSE) was widely expected to triumph in the bidding
for Liffe, London's derivatives exchange. Yet on October 29th the board of
Liffe recommended that its shareholders accept a ?555m ($806m) offer from
Euronext, the three-way merger between the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels
stock exchanges. Although Euronext's offer was less than the LSE's, it was
all in cash (not in combination with shares). It also promised to retain
Liffe's management, and to shift all of Euronext's derivatives business to
London to trade on Connect, Liffe's trading system. That combination made it
unbeatable.

Euronext's coup is a blow for the LSE, which had hoped that buying Liffe
would strengthen its position in the forthcoming consolidation of European
stock exchanges. But the LSE misplayed its hand, advertising its interest
for too long in advance and then quibbling over too many details with
Liffe's management. It will now have to find some other strategic option if
it is not to become prey to one of its rivals. Setting up its own
derivatives business will be hard: it might instead seek to buy one of the
American exchanges, perhaps the Chicago Mercantile.

The third big European stock exchange, Deutsche B?rse, which had also bid
for Liffe, will also have to find an alternative. Yet one obvious idea, to
resurrect last year's abortive marriage between it and the LSE, will be hard
to do under the two exchanges' present management, because the bust-up was
so acrimonious. That may put Euronext in the best position to become the
dominant European exchange.

Europe's investors may not care so long as trading becomes cheaper and
easier. Anyway, most of them fret more about improving clearing and
settlement in Europe, which is much more expensive than in America and so
offers greater scope for savings. The Liffe/Euronext deal immediately
triggered speculation about which European clearing houses might now merge.
The London Clearing House (LCH), which clears trades on Liffe, had
inconclusive talks last year with Clearnet, which clears Euronext trades. A
merger would now be logical. Less obvious is which way the Luxembourg-based
Clearstream will jump. On October 31st it received offers from Deutsche
B?rse (which already owns 50%) and Brussels-based Euroclear, the biggest
clearer of international bonds.

Deutsche B?rse is keen to own all of Clearstream. This would create the
first big European ""silo"", in which trading, clearing and settlement have a
single owner. Werner Seifert, chairman of Deutsche B?rse, has long
championed silos, which he thinks provide the reliability required by the
market. Critics reckon vertical silos distort competition. Benn Steil at the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York says that Deutsche B?rse might
impose discriminatory tariffs on non-German-based traders in German shares
if it were to own all of Clearstream. Others point to possible cross-subsidy
from the monopolised settlement arm to the trading platform.

One alternative is the horizontal integration of settlement agencies and
clearing-houses, to create large central counterparties-maybe two or three
for the whole of Europe. Traders would then be able to net their cash and
derivatives positions on several exchanges with a single clearing house,
saving capital. Don Cruickshank, chairman of the LSE, thinks the European
Commission in Brussels should go further and impose a single European
clearing and settlement system like America's. 

That is a very long shot. It took the intervention of Congress and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to set up the Depository Trust and
Clearing Corporation-which moved American non-government securities markets
from seven settlement agencies to one settlement organisation and one
central counterparty. Besides the defenders of silos, the European
Commission would have to contend with a different regulatory and legal
system in each member country. More realistically, market forces will drive
clearing and settlement houses to join forces, because it is more
cost-efficient when buyer, seller and security are linked.

Cut short
The Economist - November 1, 2001

The American Treasury's announcement that it will issue no more 30-year
bonds should delight corporate treasurers and depress fund managers. Cynics
also suggest that Peter Fisher, under-secretary at the Treasury, made this
move to help Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, bring
down long-term interest rates, in a fair imitation of a bull market.

The 30-year Treasury bond has been illiquid for some time because until
recently America had been retiring debt. Now that the country is a net
borrower again, it is the wrong time to take long-term debt off the menu,
say Mr. Fisher's critics. Many have a vested interest, however. The Chicago
Board of Trade, which usually carries great clout in Washington, immediately
protested that economic uncertainty since September 11th obliges the
Treasury to keep all its funding options open, including at the long end. It
is worried about losing its flagship 30-year-bond futures market. 

Bond traders, as well as inter-dealer brokers, such as Cantor Fitzgerald,
will now have to satisfy themselves with shorter maturities-these are more
liquid, but with less of the volatility that dealers love. Those traders and
investment banks that cover their 30-year trading positions with repos (bond
sales and repurchases) will find life more expensive-they will ultimately
have to buy and sell corporate bonds, which carry credit risk, rather than
supposedly risk-free government bonds. Perhaps they will use British 30-year
gilts instead.

There are winners. Swap dealers and long-term bond issuers, notably two
government agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should find more demand for
their 30-year bonds. It will please, too, those who think interest-rate swap
rates a better benchmark than Treasuries for pricing fixed-income
securities.

The biggest gripe will come from insurance companies and pension funds with
long-term liabilities-especially defined-benefit pension plans. Long-term
rates may be lower but will now come with credit risk attached. Surely Mr.
Fisher read a paper published in July by the American Academy of Actuaries
entitled ""The Impact of Inordinately Low 30-year Treasury Rates on Defined
Benefit Plans""? If he did, this plea to spare the life of 30-year Treasuries
failed to move the man of steel.

Karen,

Thanks for taking the time to discuss the confidentiality agreement pertaining to the ENA Trading Track.  As discussed, I am following up with a couple of questions regarding the contents of the agreement, specifically item 1.2.  From what I gather, the agreement very broadly covers the financial industry and I wanted to list a few scenarios to see if they are included or not included by the agreement.
- Non energy, non commodity based private equity firms
- Non energy-sector coverage within a mutual fund company
- Non derivatives based hedge fund
- Non energy based investment banking
- Equity research in with non-energy or commodity industry coverage

Please let me know for each of the above what is included and excluded.

Regards,

Gary Linhart

US Fed, Treasury, SEC, CFTC Survey Recommends No New Swaps Law
Dow Jones - December 28, 2001
By Rebecca Christie

WASHINGTON -- U.S. financial market regulators recommended no new
legislation to regulate swap agreements involving customers with low net
worth, according to a study released Thursday by four federal agencies.

The U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a joint report
on ""retail swaps"" Thursday assessing whether there was a need for further
regulation.

A swap is a type of financial transaction in which two parties agree to
exchange payments or securities over a period of time. Swaps contracts are
generally used by large institutions to hedge risk, such as interest-rate
risk or currency risk.

Retail swaps involve customers who are not ""eligible contract participants""
under federal law. This group includes individuals who have less than $10
million in assets, or less than $5 million under certain conditions, as well
as non-financial entities that have total assets of less than $10 million
and do not use swaps as a normal part of their business.

Retail swaps are not covered under recent legislation that regulates
derivatives. The study released Thursday surveyed representatives from
dealers, a derivatives trading system and a trade association.

The joint report said that the four agencies do not currently see a need to
regulate most swaps involving these small customers, with the ""possible
exception"" of energy swaps. Should regulators see a need to oversee energy
swaps, current legislation appears to give the CFTC some latitude to act,
the report said.

If interest in energy swaps were to outpace the current scope of the CFTC's
authority, Congress might wish to step in at that time, the report said.

2001: A Derivatives Odyssey
FOW - December 2001

The derivatives industry in 2001 has experienced continued consolidation
among users and exchanges. Electronic trading practices have further
penetrated into traditional procedures, while exchanges have reaped healthy
revenues from derivative contracts.

One product that has swept across the world's derivatives exchanges this
year is the single stock future. London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (Liffe) launched its Universal Stock Futures in January
2001, to great fanfare but only moderate success. Nevertheless, exchanges in
Europe and Asia rushed to jump on the single stock bandwagon. Anxious not to
miss out on the action, the US repealed the Shad-Johnson accord, in place
since 1982, which prevented investors betting on the future price of
individual stocks. The repeal was set to become effective on 21 December,
but has since been postponed to the end of March 2002. Bill Rainer, who was
chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at the
time of the repeal, notes that while the bill is generally sound, it is
still within the period of industry comment.

Rainer has since moved on and is currently heading one of the newest single
stock ventures, between Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT), Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This remarkable
alliance pools the resources and liquidity of the three exchanges, giving
serious competition to American Stock Exchange (Amex) and the joint offering
between Liffe and Nasdaq. While the single stock futures will be offered to
alt qualified market participants, Rainer feels the product will not be
suited to all sectors of the market. ""They are likely to be more attractive
to the institutional sector than the individual sector because institutions
have the resources to educate themselves about the value of the product and
its place in their strategies,"" he explains. Nevertheless, he is confident
in the product's value as a useful risk management tool for any
practitioner. However, confidence in single stocks is far from unanimous.
Not withstanding the hype, dissenters note that the volumes in single stocks
are subdued around the world. The start of trading in the US may give them a
much-needed boost but, as yet, the money is going elsewhere.

""The evolution of the index derivative product business has been the most
significant development in 2001,"" says Uwe Velten, at European derivatives
exchange, Eurex, and he thinks it will continue. ""This is just the beginning
of a strong product group. Index products are one of the most intelligent
tools to manage risk with,"" he assures. ""As they are a trend in the market,
we encourage them in our portfolio."" Velten notes that the importance of
index products has increased with their expanding geographical scope. ""For
years, futures and options on the Dax was our only index product. Then we
expanded our product offering beyond national products."" ParisBourse, Swiss
Exchange, Deutsche Bourse and Dow Jones created Stoxx in early 1998 to
provide a European-wide family of indices. ""When Eurex was created, we
captured all euro Stoxx business, and today we average around 220,000
contracts a day, and this is growing,""

Velten explains. ""Now we have moved into global offerings, with Nymex 50
futures and options and sector index products from Dow Jones, which are
growing from a small base. This is what the future will bring. The business
is growing in Europe with sector index products and, globally, with the new
Global Titans products."" Eurex has experienced 80% growth in index products
this year, compared with 250/0 growth in capital market products and the
fixed income sector, and 500/0 growth in stock options.  Eurex's five-year
German government bond (Bobl) contract was the fixed-income headline grabber
of 2001. When one market player successfully manufactured a bobl squeeze in
March by cornering the market in the physically deliverable futures
contracts, Eurex needed to act fast to avoid a repeat performance in
September. In an overhaul of its securities regulations, the exchange
introduced position limits on the futures contracts and, crucially,
rectified the discrepancy in penalty charges for the late delivery of
underlying securities with drastic cuts. The fixed income community offered
only timid approval however, and few believed a squeeze could be fully
avoided.

Sensing opportunity in the air Euronext Paris re-launched its five-year
European government bond futures contact in a bid to capture market share
from disenchanted Bobl traders. A deal between Eurex and the German finance
agency Bundesfinanz Agentur finally stretched the September Bobl, with an
agreement to supply additional bonds in case of another shortage. By
extending the pool of deliverable securities the Bobl looks set for an easy
ride this December. However, the long-term future of government debt markets
in general still hangs in the balance.

Both sides of the Atlantic have suffered a dearth of government bonds amid
treasury buy-back programmes and cuts in issuance this year. Most recently,
the US Treasury stopped issuing 30-year bonds in November. Subsequently,
investors have begun to favour the swaps market to hedge their interest rate
risk. Many market sources and the Bank for International Settlements claim
that interest rate swaps are the leading candidate to replace government
securities as the leading capital market's benchmark. In March, as the
fragmented government bond market continued to shrink amid high-profile
contract squeezes, Liffe entered the fray, hoping to mop up business with a
family of euro-denominated futures on interest rate swaps, collectively
named Swapnote. Contrary to the many doubts over the product's ability to
capture liquidity from the OTC market, it attracted substantial interest.
The success of the contract in Europe convinced Liffe to make plans for
expansion into the US market with the euro-denominated swap futures, with
speculation of a US dollar swap contract to follow.

Witnessing the success of Swapnote, and conscious of its faltering T-bond
future, CBoT introduced a suite of swaps derivatives that made a promising
debut in November. Nicholas Neubauer, chairman at CBoT, explains the
concerns underlying the decision. ""Earlier this year, there was a feeling
that the amount of publicly available Federal debt would decline to zero
over the next five to ten years. We, therefore, wanted to offer our
customers a swap contract as an alternative tool."" While these new swap
contracts have proved highly popular, they must be seen in perspective - for
example, while Liffe's daily average for Swapnote is around 20,000
contracts, Eurex's ten-year bond averages nearer 500,000. Nevertheless, it
is a product class with great potential. As Neubauer says: ""If it is going
to be a winner, it will be a big winner.""

Volumes in the options market have been thriving in 2001. A single day
record of 2.7m was notched by CBOE in April, which is now in competition
with five other options exchanges in the US. ""We are very pleased with this
year's performance, especially in light of the increased competition, both
domestically and internationally,"" says Edward Provost, executive vp at
CBOE. However, all has not been plain sailing, and the options market has
suffered upheaval with the move to decimalisation. ""In the case of options,
this change required a substantial technological effort to trade decimals
instead of fractions,"" comments Provost. ""It also has a significant impact
on the way options traders operate, even more than on the stock side."" The
move to modernity was sanctioned because a stock price quoted in fractions
forces an artificially wide spread. But while decimalisation allows for many
more potential price points for a stock, it subsequently creates an
amplification of complexity for options pricing. ""This increased capacity
for market quotation results in an increased number of market floatation
updates,"" explains Provost. ""So it was all about operational preparedness,
and adapting systems for a surge in business. For CBOE, the change to
decimals went very smoothly.""

Electronic trading
Technological upheaval has affected many derivatives exchanges in 2001 and
the troubles at CBoT have been symptomatic of the industry as a whole. ""By
the end of 2000 there was a great deal of doom and gloom on the trading
floor about the impact of electronic trading,"" says Nicholas Neubauer. ""Our
business model of open-outcry trading was being slated for early extinction
in favour of electronic matching engines."" On top of this, he explains,
plans to become a for-profit organisation were seen as simplistic and caused
two lawsuits with the CBOE. In addition, the ceo of 20 years left. Having
set forth a programme of ten promises, including modifying the restructuring
plan, hiring a high quality ceo, and settling the law suits, Neubauer has
now put the exchange back on track.

Meanwhile, Ace, the electronic trading joint venture between CBoT and Eurex,
has been the subject of much wrangling over maintenance responsibilities.
However, the platform averages around 20,000 contracts a day, accounting for
roughly 230/0 of business. ""Generally we have found that, on volatile days,
people use open-outcry and, on slow days, Ace increases its market share,""
explains Neubauer. ""During volatile periods, traders get more information
out of a central marketplace than the more sterile environment of screen
trading."" After the heartache that electronic trading and Ace in particular
caused, it was Ace's performance that fuelled the exchange's return to
profit in September.  Teething problems with new electronic trading systems
have been rife among many derivatives exchanges this year. As CBoT and Eurex
feuded over Ace, London Metal Exchange saw a lacklustre response to Select,
picking up slightly after a phase two launch in October, and New York
Mercantile Exchange argued with the providers of Enymex.

However, Liffe's Connect system has been the key to the revival of its
fortunes. After a few false starts, Connect has quickly gained acclaim for
its superior matching and distribution capabilities. Liffe won its first
major deal with Nasdaq to list futures on single stocks on Connect. Then, in
July, Liffe agreed to provide Connect products and services to Tokyo
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Tiffe). In an alliance similar to
Ace, the Connect link allows Tiffe and Liffe members to trade on one
another's exchanges. It was Liffe's aptitude with derivative technology that
placed the company on a firm footing for November's merger. 

In October, CBOE launched CBOEdirect, to a modest reception. The system will
operate in pre-trade hours, initially with options on the Dow Jones
Industrial Index. CBOE's Provost explains that a feature of the system is
underscoring the world's altered preoccupations. ""One benefit of beginning
to use screen-based trading is that it is a very logical and viable disaster
recovery trading system. This is something we, and other exchanges, are
looking at.""

Of course, any retrospective on 2001 would not be complete without mention
of the World Trade Centre tragedy. During this terrible time, the financial
community came together with firm resolve, to help colleagues and
competitors alike, in an unprecedented show of solidarity. There was a
defiant determination to keep financial markets functioning as close to
normality as possible throughout the terrible ordeal, and in memory of those
who died.

Enron's Departure from Core Business
Takes a Toll on Performance 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) stock sustained further heavy losses on October 19 as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years. The energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent at $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on Oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million. As of early morning trading on Oct. 22, Enron shares were priced at $21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new Securities and Exchange inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors. 

Analysis: Enron's first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory. While Skilling cited personal reasons for his departure, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enron's share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. At the time of Skilling's departure, Enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week low. However, based on the new 3Q report, it now appears that Enron's downward turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company's top spot. In essence, Enron's financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales. It appears that Enron is learning a costly lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company's innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised. The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron, as a good number of unresolved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company. 

Let's first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the third quarter. As noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in losses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. When we break down the losses, it becomes clear that Enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband and the retail power market. Specifically, Enron reported $287 million in charges from Azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 million in what the company is calling ""investment losses."" Evidently, about half of the $544-million figure is related to Enron's investment in NewPower Company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that Enron launched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM. Enron owns 45 percent of NewPower. In addition, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although Lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002. However, it is important to note that Enron's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000. 

The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting. As one of the leading investors in the company, Enron drove NewPower's aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the United States. NewPower went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price. However, the company's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently priced at $1.25. NewPower is not scheduled to release its own 3Q financial statement until early November, but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Specifically, NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3Q loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Third-quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that the company had forecast in August. 

In analyzing NewPower's 2Q financial losses (see IssueAlert from 8/8/01 at www.scientech.com/rci <http://www.secure.scientech.com/IssueAlert>), I argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the United States. On the positive side, NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts, most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp. and DTE Energy. These purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for NewPower, and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states. However, the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen, apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates. This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better, and the company's stock has continued to drop as a result. 

In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, NewPower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp. and several of its subsidiaries. The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries through Jan. 4, 2002. With the lowered financial obligations that it must make to Enron, NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset-based financing. 

However, from Enron's perspective, the losses associated with NewPower (and, by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price. The message is clear: The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole. Further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enron's part has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently Wall Street has reacted by sending Enron's stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago. The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique, but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from what was a successful core business. Further, they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. The problem with Enron's bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's services from materializing as anticipated. The problem with Azurix, which has been losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies anticipated. In addition to these problem areas, Enron also faces challenges related to its investments in India (where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government) and California (from which Enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales). 

In addition to the losses outlined in the 3Q report, there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week. First, the SEC has requested that Enron provide information regarding ""certain related party transactions."" Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry. However, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from Enron. Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SEC's request. In a separate development, several mutual funds (including AIM Constellation that once held large positions in Enron) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened Enron's stock value. Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader. 

The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses. Thus, Lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are still strong. Further, Lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to ""clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses."" Nevertheless, the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. Thus, several questions remain at this juncture. Are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading? Or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? Moving forward, will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? Only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at Enron, which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change.

ISDA Names Mengle To New Position As Head Of Research
Dow Jones Newswires
By Joe Niedzielski

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said Monday that it had
appointed David Mengle as head of research.

Mengle will be responsible for providing research and analytical support for
various ISDA committees and initiatives in this newly created position, ISDA
said in a press release.

In particular, Mengle will work on aspects of ISDA's risk management
activities, providing technical assistance on issues surrounding the Basel
capital accord. He will also oversee ISDA's market survey and will work to
produce surveys in other areas.

Over the past several years, Mengle assisted ISDA by conducting derivatives
operations and documentation seminars and he will continue his involvement
in this area, ISDA said.

""David brings an enormous amount of industry and academic experience to
ISDA,"" said Robert Pickel, ISDA's executive director and CEO.

""His expertise in risk management, derivatives products and regulation will
strengthen ISDA's mission to encourage the prudent and efficient development
of the privately negotiated derivatives business,"" Pickel said in the
statement

Mengle was most recently with the consulting firm Rutter Associates.
Previously, he was a vice president at J.P. Morgan and worked on a number of
policy and capital related issues. Prior to that, he was a research
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

End-users Build Up Experience
IFR - November 24, 2001

End-users of credit derivatives in the US and Canada are trading an average
of 65 deals a year and make use of with six to seven traders on average,
according to a report released last week by consultant Greenwich Associates.
""The larger the user, the more dealers they are using,"" said Peter D'Amario,
principal at Greenwich and one of the authors.

The multiple points of contact, though they complicate documentation for
end-users, indicate that end-users are learning and triangulating what they
are hearing, D'Amario said. As credit derivatives are still a relatively new
market, this strategy may assist users in benefiting from price
differentials. ""They are still concerned enough to go around and talk with
people,"" he added.

The largest and most sophisticated users of credit derivatives report an
average of 150 trades a year, according to the report. Banks were the
biggest users of credit derivatives in terms of volume. Reinsurers and
insurers, fund mangers and hedge funds, in that order, filled in the ranking
of users, said D'Amario, noting that corporates ranked last on the list of
users.

About one-third of the corporates interviewed for the survey said they did
not use credit derivatives. However, no other grouping is looking so
aggressively at becoming involved in the market in the future. Roughly half
of the corporates not currently using credit derivatives stated an intention
to use them within the next year. The inter-dealer market was excluded from
the survey.

""Although [end-users] are using six or seven dealers, they are giving 80% of
their business to three of their top dealers. The other three or four are
fighting for 20% of the business,"" said D'Amario.

""That's unsustainable. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a contraction in
the average number of dealing relationships."" Firms that do not offer a
broad product array may be knocked out first. Greenwich said the dealers
that fare best in its rankings are those that offer a depth and breadth of
relationships, product knowledge, structuring ability and an understanding
of client needs, D'Amario said.

About 40% of end-users cited a relationship as a reason for picking a
dealer, though 53% listed competitive quotes as their top reason for
selecting a dealer. ""When we asked people that, right off the bat they say
competitive quotes. Then, we derive from data what [it is that] correlates
with being one of a user's top three dealers. It is never competitive
quotes. The real reason for selecting a dealer is relationships,"" D'Amario
said.

Treasury's Bair: Congress Should Pass Netting Laws This Year
Dow Jones - November 26, 2001
By Rebecca Christie

A senior Treasury official said Friday that Congress should find a way to
pass so-called netting legislation, even if more broad-based bankruptcy
legislation stalls.

Sheila Bair, assistant secretary for financial institutions, told an
American Bar Association committee that there was an immediate need for the
proposal, which would make it easier for banks and businesses to settle
financial contracts if one of the parties becomes insolvent.

""The relevant provisions are a non-controversial portion of broader
legislation to revise the bankruptcy laws. We are concerned, however, that
the controversial issues of the broader legislation may not be resolved soon
enough to allow its passage this year,"" Bair said.

The proposed changes would limit market disruptions in the event of
insolvency and also reduce the risks to federally regulated participants and
to the overall financial system, Bair said.

""Whether as part of comprehensive bankruptcy reform legislation or as a
stand-alone bill, we believe that Congress should enact netting legislation
this year. Further delays would unnecessarily place the financial system at
greater risk,"" Bair said.

Momentum Builds For US Derivatives Insolvency Bill
Dow Jones - November 26, 2001
By Dawn Kopecki

The nation's leading securities trading groups urged congressional leaders
Tuesday to pass legislation that allows financial institutions and
corporations to close out their derivatives contracts during an insolvency.

""The current economic climate, worsened by the tragedy of Sept. 11, has made
passage of these provisions...critical to the systemic risk reduction given
the combination of market disruption and economic uncertainty,"" reads a
letter sent Tuesday to House and Senate leaders from The Bond Market
Association, The Financial Services Roundtable, International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, the Futures Industry Association and a half dozen
other financial organizations.

Pressure to pass the legislation has mounted since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks shut down U.S. financial markets and destroyed the Manhattan offices
of many Wall Street brokerage houses.

Even though no company went under as a result of the market disruption, the
fear of institutional failures has grown, and support is mounting for
passing the provision apart from the controversial bankruptcy bill to which
it is attached.

The measure allows institutions to quickly close outstanding derivatives
with bankrupt trading partners by netting all the losses and gains of
individual contracts into one deal.

""Congress should not fail to enact netting legislation this year,"" Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill wrote
House lawmakers last month. ""Further delays would unnecessarily place the
financial system at greater risk.""

But congressional support for tightening U.S. bankruptcy laws has dwindled
in the face of a probable recession. As a result, Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.,
introduced the netting measure as its own bill in the House last week.

""Although we support passage of these provisions as part of the larger
bankruptcy-reform legislation....we share concerns of the key financial
regulators that broader (bankruptcy) legislation may not be resolved soon
enough to allow passage this year,"" the trade groups wrote. ""We urge you and
your leadership team to pass (netting legislation) as quickly as possible so
that we do not miss an opportunity for enactment this year.""

German regulator may follow US 
Financial Times - November 27, 2001
By Bertrand Benoit

The integration of European capital markets means Germany's securities
regulator will need to model itself increasingly on the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, according to Georg Wittich, the German authority's
chairman.

""One should examine whether the SEC might not be the appropriate structure
for securities regulation in the future,"" Mr Wittich said in an interview.

""We will have to go towards more centralisation at the German level as the
need arises for increased co-operation between reg-ulators at the European
level.""

Created in 1994, the Frankfurt-based Federal Supervisory Office for
Securities Trading, or BAWe, is one of the few financial markets regulators
in Europe not to act as supervisor for the stock exchange. For historical
reasons, this responsibility lies with the government of the state of Hesse.

Although BAWe is responsible for overseeing companies' official
announcements to financial market participants, it has no power to
investigate suspected cases of market manipulation and no authority to
approve share offer prospectuses if they are linked to a public listing.

While it is mandated to investigate insider trading, the authority has no
right to sue or sanction offenders. Instead, it must transfer all suspected
cases to a public prosecutor for criminal investigation. In practice, few
insider-trading cases ever reach court.

A planned bill, recently adopted by the German government and set for
approval by parliament next year, would make BAWe responsible for fighting
market manipulation, including the key prerogative to file civil claims
against suspected offenders.

From January, the authority will also be responsible for enforcing Germany's
first compulsory takeover code. Meanwhile, despite opposition from the
insurance industry and regional central banks, a draft bill by the finance
ministry should result in the merger next year of BAWe with the federal bank
and insurance regulators into a centralised financial supervisor.

Yet there is no plan to give the watchdog authority over the Frankfurt stock
exchange.

""The separation of roles (with each state being responsible for policing
stock exchanges on its territory) is above all historical,"" says Mr Wittich.
""We have a high quality of supervision, but a rapprochement in this respect
- which should be a matter the federal and state governments - is something
to think about for the future."" Germany's courts chase after companies,

UK's FSA Consults On Implications Of Basel Accord Delay
Dow Jones - November 27, 2001
By Sarah Turner

The U.K.'s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, said
Tuesday that it has set out for consultation the implications of a one-year
delay to the revised Basel Capital Accord on integrated prudential
supervision for U.K. financial firms.

The new Basel Accord framework is intended to improve the safety and
soundness of the financial system by placing more emphasis on banking
internal controls and management, the supervisory review process and market
discipline.  These international initiatives have been delayed until at
least the start of 2005.

The FSA's director of prudential standards, Clive Briault, said the FSA was
previously planning to implement its integrated prudential sourcebook at the
start of 2004, in line with the implementation of the new Basel Accord and
related new European Union legislation.

Briault said ""we believe that we should not defer all the benefits of
integrated regulation simply on account of the delays in international
discussions.""  He added that ""our preferred option is to implement as much
as possible of the sourcebook early in 2004, while deferring those parts
which will or may have to be changed significantly as a result of the
international discussions.""

Key candidates for implementation in 2004 are sourcebook provisions relating
to insurance companies, Lloyds insurance and friendly societies.  Briault
said other areas suitable for early implementation are systems and controls,
investment firms not covered by the Investment Services Directive,
operational risk and, in part, market risk.

Nuclear Experts Respond to Yucca Mountain IssueAlert 


By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President

Brian O'Connell, P.E., Director of Nuclear Waste Program Office for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and Janet Schlueter, Chief of Staff and Nuclear Materials Assistant for Commissioner Edward McGaffigan of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), sent us several clarifying points concerning Yucca Mountain and nuclear waste, which we believe should be shared with our readership. 

The action taken by the NRC on October 23 was not an ""approval"" of the Yucca Mountain site. What the NRC approved was the ""site suitability guidelines""-the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Part 963 general repository siting guidelines that the DOE will use to evaluate Yucca Mountain when it submits a recommendation to the President on whether the site is ""suitable"" for the repository purpose. Then, after the unusual approval procedures of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the next step would be to submit a license application to the NRC to build the repository. The Commission's concurrence on DOE's general repository siting rule is separate and distinct from any comments NRC may have on DOE's preliminary site suitability recommendation. 

According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), 2,000 metric tons are generated by the nuclear industry per year, not 30,000 tons per year as we reported. The entire industry has produced about 40,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel over the past four decades. 

Finally, the federal government may not be able to avoid responsibility for the actual transport of nuclear materials to Yucca Mountain. Section 137(a)(2) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act does call for the DOE to ""utilize by contract private industry to the fullest extent possible."" Regardless of whether the shipments are made by the government or contractors, all shipments must meet NRC and other federal and state regulatory requirements.

"Re: TV Spot on BEAR","The spot was terrific and exhibited high professionalism.  We were the main feature and Judi was great.  Thank you Judi for telling the ""great"" stories--and in sound bites!  A clip of Laura Bush with a voice-over telling about her involvement with the Dallas room and the growth to 84 rooms in the State followed.  Next, the two newscasters introduced their own bears they were donating to BEAR and offered viewers the opportunity to phone their station's special number (and Lori got three calls, too, within minutes of the airing) or to log onto Good News.com for more info from Channel 2.  Next,the children from St. John's school were featured as they entered the museum holding their donated bears high (no school uniforms could be seen).  The SJS students were then featured sitting in rows at the IMAX  and the voice-over explained the ""deal"" at the Museum of Natural Science.  I was thoroughly pleased and know Judy Hay will obtain multiple copies of the show for us! 
 
 Judy, let me know if I can get a tape and make copies when I am over at Murworth seeing George next Thursday/Friday.  Have a great weekend, all.  (And the Director search has not produced the perfect candidate this week.)  Linda Hunsaker

"RE: *Cuts","Lance,

Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!

I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have.   

Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.

Michelle

Lance,

  I have been told that all cuts will be based on PRC.  Kristina Mordaunt was my last reviewer and I have serious doubts about the fairness of her review.  If this becomes an issue, I would appreciate it if you would talk to Paul Racicot and Jim Fallon about the quality of my performance at EBS.  Thanks

"Master Netting Agreement:  Update, Issues, Questions","
We are nearing the ""final"" form of the document for further use.  I have asked Bradford to speak with you regarding use of it for major trading counterparties that may not be investment grade, but with whom Credit sees the ability to greatly enhance our liquidity via netting of margin requirements (not the small accounts).

Two issues.

1.  Do you think we should write a risk memo concerning the issues surrounding the ultimate effectiveness under the Code and ""square setoff"" rights?  Basically, the intent would be to clarify that if a court did not enforce the close-out netting, and then did not enforce the square setoff, our collateral position on a trading master by trading master basis could be underwater because we would have netted the positions under the master netting agreement for margining purposes.  Further to this, the bankruptcy reform aspects of this issue are not moving as previously hoped due to consumer issues and current events.

2.  FYI:  It has come to my attention this week that Global Finance has consummated a receivable financing, and desires to consummate additional such financings which conflict with master netting agreements in place (as well as setoff language in trading contracts) and with the general concept of master netting for the future.  We are meeting tomorrow with Bradford and Global Finance representatives to gather facts, sort through the issues, and try to resolve what appear to be different objectives concerning trading receivables.  From a cash perspective, I would think Enron as whole would get more benefit from master netting (dollar for dollar benefit) than loan security (which would never be a dollar for dollar benefit)--do you think this is a correct analysis?

ISDA survey reveals strong upward trend
IFR - November 10, 2001

The global notional outstanding volume of credit derivatives transactions
hit US$631.497bn for the first half of 2001, according to the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association's first survey of credit derivatives
transactions. ""While still modest in relation to interest rate products,
this figure is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to more
mature derivative product areas,"" ISDA said.

ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit
default swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to 10 credits, and portfolio
transactions of 10 credits and more. Eighty-three member firms supplied data
for the survey.

Interest rate and currency derivatives growth clocked in at just above 3.5%
in the first half of the year among members that also reported at year-end
2000, ISDA said. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes
increased to about US$55.2trn from roughly US$53.3trn.

Total notional principal of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and
currency swaps for all surveyed firms slid to US$57.3trn from US$G3trn at
year-end last year. Among the top 10 dealers, a minor decrease in volume
from US$35.6trn to US$35.Strn was recorded, ISDA noted.

According to Thomas Montag, chair of ISDA's market survey committee, the
shifting product use reflected greater uncertainty in the global market
environment. ""The market for credit protection has an obvious appeal during
times of economic downturn,"" he added.

ISDA's survey is compiled twice a year by Andersen. Sixty-seven of the 83
member firms that participated in this survey also participated in the
previous survey.


ISDA's new supplement includes converts in default swaps
Dow Jones - November 12, 2001
By Joe Niedzielski

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The International Swaps and Derivatives Association
has published a supplement to its 1999 document for credit derivatives which
incorporates convertible bonds and zero-coupon bonds, among others, as
deliverable securities in these contracts. 

The trade group said late Friday that it had finalized and published its
Supplement Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations.

The supplement addresses the treatment under the 1999 ISDA Credit
Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and exchangeable
obligations, as well as the treatment of accreting obligations, such as
zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and non-discounted
bonds that accrete during their term, ISDA said. 

""The Convertibles Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of
constituents in the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio
managers, credit protection sellers and dealers,"" said Robert G. Pickel,
ISDA's executive director and CEO. 

Credit default swaps allow buyers to transfer the risk of a default on
obligations like bonds or loans, or other types of credit events like a debt
restructuring. They have had a growing influence in the broader fixed-income
universe, at times playing a role in the pricing of corporate bonds. 

And some convertible-bond investors will lay off the credit risk from the
fixed-income portion of a convertible security by buying credit default swap
protection. 

ISDA's supplement was expected. A group of U.S.-based dealers submitted a
proposal to ISDA a few months ago to include obligations like convertible
bonds as deliverable securities in these contracts. 

And in mid-October, ISDA told members that convertible bonds were
deliverable under standard credit derivatives contracts. The group's
memorandum to members came in response to questions from members following
the appointment of a railway administrator for Railtrack PLC (U.RTK). 

Holders of convertible bonds issued by Railtrack had complained that some
sellers of credit protection weren't paying claims on default swap contracts
on the Railtrack credit. 


The Basel perplex
The Economist - November 8, 2001

The arcane world of banking supervision is not usually the talk of German
chancellors on tours of Asia. Gerhard Schr?der made an exception recently
when he threatened that Germany would veto any new European directive based
on the latest proposals from the Basel committee of big-country bank
supervisors. In its present form, said Mr Schr?der in Bangalore, Basel 2 (as
the proposals are known) is ""unacceptable to Germany"".

Basel 2 attempts to formulate more precisely than before the levels of
""regulatory"" capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the credit
and other risks that they run. After more than three years of talks, the
Basel boffins have developed rules which are still not acceptable to
commercial banks. That is strange, since they are supposed to mirror the way
the world's most sophisticated banks themselves calculate their risks. The
whole exercise has shades of Heath Robinson about it.

The banks are up in arms, this week bearding the Basel committee for its
latest draft rules, which get ever more complicated and prescriptive. By the
time they are implemented, in 2005 at the earliest, the rules look likely to
burden banks with extra costs (ie, through the need to run parallel
reporting systems) and perverse incentives to ""game"" the system. Basel 2
could thus aggravate the very thing it set out to correct, a distortion of
financial markets.

Germany's grouse has to do with the Mittelstand, the 3m small and
medium-sized companies that are the economy's backbone. The Basel 2 formulae
for credit risk are based on credit ratings applied to company debt, either
by rating agencies or internally by banks themselves. But few smaller
companies are rated in this way. Moreover, German companies are more than
usually dependent on medium-term bank loans, and the longer the loan the
more it is penalised under the proposals. 

The Germans-but also the Italians and the Japanese-fear that their
medium-sized companies will lose under the new capital regime. Many of the
2,800 German banks are not equipped to rate the companies to which they
lend: equipping them would drive up the cost of lending. German bank
associations plan to help by pooling credit data for their members. But Mr
Schr?der's advice to banks last week was that they should not be overhasty
in applying the new Basel principles ahead of time.

Already the committee is working on a fix. On November 5th it posted a
clutch of new suggestions on its website that included new risk weightings
for smaller companies, and proposals that physical collateral, receivables
and even leased assets be used to lessen a particular company's credit
charge. These were interim ideas, it said, which needed to be tested and
even revised.

All well and good. But the Basel committee is getting into knots trying to
address every objection as it arises. Each time, it seems, the committee
adds another layer of complexity for banks and their supervisors to master.
Most recently, after strident objections by banks, there was the shifting of
the ""w-factor"" (the possibly unquantifiable residual risk in a credit
derivative) from one supervisory category to another, and also the setting
of arbitrary minimum risk weights for unrated securitised assets. The figure
for operational risk (non-market risks such as the loss of data, a rogue
trader or the destruction of a bank's headquarters) has been slashed, after
objections from banks.

The November 5th pabulum came in response to a ""quantitative impact study""
(a live study of how the proposed capital charges would affect a sample of
138 banks in 25 countries). The Basel committee has always said that the
scale of charges needs to be properly calibrated. In fact, it gave itself an
extra year to get the calibration right. It has invited some banks to take
part in a fresh impact study using its latest proposed adjustments.

The results should help the Basel committee to tweak its formulae to get
results. Its declared goal is not to increase or decrease the overall
capital charge imposed on the banking system, merely to allocate it more
efficiently.

But some regulators are worried that the more risk-sensitive the regime is,
the more reluctant banks will be to lend in a downturn, aggravating economic
cycles. There are attempts to fix this too. For example, Spain allows its
banks to make a provision at the inception of a loan-putting money aside for
a rainy day. Some countries need to fix their accounting regimes before they
can follow suit.

Regulators appear stoically optimistic that all these fixes will work, and
that a credible new framework will be established-not without flaws,
perhaps, but better than what exists today. The timetable may slip, but the
plan is to produce a final draft framework early next year, allowing
consultation until the end of March, which should result in a firm set of
rules by the end of 2002. That, in theory, still allows time for the
European Union to draft and finalise a matching directive on capital
adequacy for banks and financial firms, to be in force by January 2005.

With Basel 2, bank supervisors are trying to do three main things. They want
to devise formulae that bring capital charges closer to the banks' own
measures of risk. They want to establish continuous review of banks'
management, and especially of their risk management, as a factor in
adjusting the capital charge. And they want to create incentives for greater
public disclosure of banks' risk exposures. This is an attempt to let
markets take on more of a supervisory role. Yet, in reality, the supervisors
are becoming micro-managers.

A member of the Basel committee insists that most of the world's 36,000
banks will be governed by a regime no more complex than Basel 1, in force
today. The more sophisticated financial groups that aspire to a so-called
""advanced"" approach will be treated differently. ""We'll be crawling all over
them initially,"" says the supervisor, ""because ultimately we're giving them
more freedom.""

All the same, in between the lowest and the highest, thousands of banks will
be graduating from a standardised to a more sophisticated approach, with
heavy demands on supervisors' time. Only America and Britain already have a
culture of continuous review by supervisors. Most other regimes are either
less sophisticated, or they are hamstrung by non-adjustable capital charges
that are set at a minimum by law.

Then there is the Brussels hurdle. Whatever the Basel committee decides
works for banks must be applied in the European Union to all investment
firms, including broker-dealers and asset managers. The scope is huge for
further descent into mind-boggling detail. Supervisors and financial firms
may well end up thanking Mr Schr?der if he vetoed the lot.


Supervisors review cross-sectoral practice
IFR - November 10, 2001

The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation
of Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors last week released, under the banner of the Joint Forum, two
reports comparing risk management practices and principles in the sectors
they supervise.

Both reports were principally aimed at the supervision of conglomerates that
incorporate businesses in banking, securities and insurance, but one also
took a close look at risk transfer practices.

The first report, Risk Management Practices and Regulatory Capital, compared
the approaches in each sector in an effort to ""gain a better understanding
of current industry practices in all three sectors"". The main sections of
the report focus on: differences in core business activities, similarities
and differences in risk management tools, approaches to capital regulation
in the three sectors and cross-sectoral risk transfers and investments.

It is in relation to the latter two sections that the report provided what
some may regard as its sting. The Joint Forum suggested that as supervisors
evaluate the extent of cross-sectoral activity, in terms of risk transfer
using derivatives, securitisation and other techniques: ""It may become
important for the individual sectoral frameworks to be updated to better
reflect the contemporary risk profiles of the firms subject to those
frameworks. It would not be surprising, for example, for some jurisdictions
in the near future to consider greater convergence in the frameworks applied
to the different sectors.""

The report explained that supervisors should consider the potential for
existing capital regulations to provide incentives for capital arbitrage.
""To the extent that some firms are engaging in activities that are not
addressed through capital requirements, supervisors need to ensure that
other measures are in place to ensure that the associated risks are being
appropriately managed and are supported by sufficient economic capital,"" it
added.

As a result, the report said, supervisors should continue to evaluate
approaches that could be taken to address crosssectoral investments within
the various capital frameworks.  The second report, Core Principles,
compared the core principles each supervisor has issued to its respective
sector as risk management guidelines.

The Joint Forum found that each set of core principles provided an overview
of the essential elements of the supervisory regime in that sector at the
time they were written (1997-2000).  However, the pace of developments in
the financial sector since then has required consideration of the need to
keep the core principles updated.  The report found no evidence of
underlying conflict or contradiction between the three sets of core
principles at the highest levels. However, in some cases there are
significant differences in the application of similar principles.

Q:  From a business standpoint are Gipper and Rockne now one company?

A:  Not until closing, which may not occur for several months.  Until that time the law [antitrust law] requires that we continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have in the past.  In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc.  We should act towards Rockne the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.

"Re: ISMA study on derivatives use by governments","
I have a copy of the ISMA study if anyone wants one.  Do we have any idea
of why ISMA would do such a study?

Subject:  Re: ISMA study on derivatives use by governments


Today's FT (page 6 of the European edition) reports fully and faithfully
about
the debt management via swaps of the Italian Treasury, and about the Yen
transaction that was apparently singled out in the ISMA study. Eurostat has
always been aware of the transactions, that have been specifically
approved. I
attach a Bloomberg release on the issue. It is interesting that the ISMA
study
is no longer available on ISMA web site. Also, I don't see in today's news
any
trace of the press conference announced in the ISMA press release.

ANS 06:23 STATE AUDITOR OFFENDED OVER EMU ALLEGATIONS

R ECS BLG XQKH
STATE AUDITOR OFFENDED OVER EMU ALLEGATIONS

    (ANSA) - Rome, November 6 - Italy's State Auditor General
Andrea Monorchio today said he was ""deeply offended"" by
allegations in the foreign press that Italy had ""juggled the
books"" in order to qualify for European Monetary Union (EMU)at
the end of the 1990s.
     The allegations, appearing in Britain's Financial Times and
The Guardian, as well as the Wall Street Journal, involved
Italy's use of a currency swap to ""disguise"" the exact amount of
its deficit in order to meet the parameters to join the euro.
  According to Monorchio, these allegations were ""mental
masturbation.""
     Yesterday's press reports were based on a report by the
International Securities Market Association (ISMA), a
self-regulatory organization, and the Council on Foreign
Relations, an independent US-research group, in which a case was
outlined where a European country appeared to have used the
derivatives market to hide the exact size of its budget deficit.
     Although Italy was never named in the report, the FT said,
the report cited a case in which a 1995 bond issue was used in a
1997 currency swap aimed at temporarily reducing a country's
budget deficit. This example, the FT said, coincided exactly
with what happened with Italy's 1995 200 billion yen bond issue.
     Italy's qualification for EMU was orchestrated by
then-Premier Romano Prodi, now president of the European
Commission, and then-Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
Italy's current head of state.
     ""I am deeply offended,"" Monorchio said on the sidelines of
a meeting here with the Industrialists Union, ""I worked very
long and hard with Ciampi. We closed 1997 with a spending
deficit of 2.7% (of GDP) because the European Union would not
allow us to calculate nine trillion lire in revenue from the
sale of gold reserves. Otherwise our budget deficit would have
been, according to Eurostat, 2.4-2.5%.""
     After recalling that the EU yesterday was quick to deny
that Italy had in any way juggled its books, Monorchio added
""Can anyone seriously imagine someone like President Ciampi
involved in such skulduggery?""
     ""I myself am just a simple accountant and intend to remain
one,"" he concluded.

Subject:	LC Facilities: Material Litigation wording
Importance:	High

To confirm my conversation with Joel just now.

We have been speaking to Michael Brown about giving the representation contained in Clause 4.1(f) of the West LB Facility Agreement relating to material litigation, accompanied with a general disclosure letter.  

Given our distance from the SEC inquiries and other potential litigation, we are not in position to confirm whether or not such litigation has a reasonable possibility of success and/or the effects an adverse decision might have on Enron Corp's business and, more importantly, consolidated financial position or consolidated results.

Accordingly, we cannot give this representation here in Europe and thus cannot issue LC Requests under the West LB facility until we receive a short, written confirmation from (i) a senior Enron Corp officer, for example, Jeff or Ben and (ii) a senior Enron Corp lawyer, eg, Mark Haedicke or Jordan, that, as a factual matter, Enron Corp is not as of today in breach of the representation contained in Clause 4.1(f) and thus we can issue ""clean"" LC Request Forms, without a qualification to this representation (but with, if necessary, a disclosure letter about the SEC inquiry and other litigation).  

We have also been asked by West LB to explain why yesterday we issued the LC Request form attaching Schedule A, ie, stating that we could not give the Clause 4.1(f) representation and today or tomorrow we intend to issue an LC Request without such qualification to Clause 4.1(f).  I should be grateful if you would draft this letter or let me know the circumstances behind the issuance of the original LC Request yesterday.

Please call Marcus or me if you want to discuss this further.  My direct line is +44 207 783 2403 and mobile is +44 7785 295876.

Kind regards

Sophie Martin

RE:			Next Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting


Dear All,

Based on your responses our Next Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting will be held
on Thursday, October 4, 2001 at 11:00 am New York time at ISDA. As usual, we
will provide a call in number for people that are traveling or located
abroad.

ISDA is considering a visit to Brazil of several days in order to hold
meetings with the Central Bank as well as other regulators - NMC, e.g.,
market players, netting legislation contacts, lawyers working on master
agreement development, and others in order to further the agenda of the
Brazilian Subcommittee and to be able to prepare for the conference planned
for Brazil next year.

In preparation for our subcommittee meeting ISDA would like to obtain from
your institution by Thursday a list (""Wish List"") of local OTC derivatives
market issues for ISDA to address as well as suggestions for meetings and
organizations with which ISDA might meet to address these issues. This ""Wish
List"" will be of enormous help to ISDA for purposes of having an adequate
and focused agenda for planning visits with a number of Brazilian
institutions and authorities. 

Please reply R.S.V.P. by email to Scott Marra (smarra@isda.org) if you would
like to attend.

If you have additional suggestions in terms of the topics to be included in
our agenda please do not hesitate to contact me.

Subject:	Nomination to be a Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army for Texas

Sheila/John

In reference to the discussion on Wednesday, I wanted to provide more information concerning the Secretary of the Army's Civilian Aide Program.  As I mentioned last Friday I received a call from Tom White's office indicating his intention to nominate me to be a Civilian Aide for Texas.  

This is an honorary position (protocol equivalency of a Major General).  Each state normally has one person serving in the capacity of a civilian advisor to the Secretary of the Army.  Large states like Texas, New York, California, Florida may have two representatives.  Generally the Civilian Aide  may be asked to represent the Secretary at functions within the state or to work with active duty installations, such as Ft Hood, on matters impacting the civilian interface with the Army.  It also could involve activities associated with reserve and national guard components within the state.

It is my understanding it may require being out of the office 6 to 8 days a year in addition to several functions in the evening or on the week end or meetings at the Pentagon or Ft Sam Houston.  I do not believe this would conflict with Enron's interest or work requirements.  In fact may bring some positive recognition to the Company in having a person serve in this capacity.  There is no compensation paid for the service but I understand the Army reimburses for travel related expenses.  It is not a political position but one designated for community/business leaders within a given state.

I trust this will be acceptable to Enron.  Perhaps, it could be viewed somewhat similar to a person being in the National Guard or Army Reserve.

Please let me know if you need any more information.

Randy

Korean Regulation Change Will Allow Onshore Equity 
Derivatives Week - November 26, 2001

The Financial Supervisory Service in Korea will permit local securities
houses to trade over-the-counter equity derivatives next July; a move that
players said will bolster the market. ""[The regulations] will strengthen the
competitiveness of the securities companies and offer investors a greater
range of choices in the financial market,"" said Lee Young Gi, associate in
the securities supervision department of the FSS in Seoul. 

""More participants will lead to greater liquidity,"" said Charles Chiang,
equity derivatives trader at Nomura International in Hong Kong. He continued
that offshore flow products such as index options and equity swaps for the
Korean market totaled about USD100 million this year. Chiang added that with
the new regulations enacted, the Korean OTC market is set to grow, likely
expanding by over 50% in the first year and substantially higher after that.
""We've been waiting for this for a long time,"" noted one equity derivatives
regional head at a global firm in Hong Kong. ""This is good news,"" he
continued, ""this will in effect open up the onshore market for international
players."" Currently, international firms trade primarily in the offshore
market. 

Condensed default swap confirmation launched
IFR - November 24, 2001

IP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley last week introduced a credit default
swap master agreement to the European market, which reduces documentation to
a one-page confirmation form.

The master agreement is based on the 1999 International Swaps and
Derivatives Association credit derivatives definitions, but 22 of the 30
clauses that are typically subject to agreement are standardised under the
shorter master agreement, leaving only eight clauses to be agreed for each
trade.

The two banks said that use of the new master agreement would allow quicker
trade confirmation, reduce operational risk and should eventually improve
market liquidity. They did their first trade using the new master agreement
last Tuesday and had closed a total of six deals using the new form by
Friday. The two banks' London offices typically trade credit derivatives
with one another five to 10 times a week.

The new agreement had not been adopted by any other dealers by the end of
last week, and traders expressed some surprise that the two US banks had
launched the document on their own, without consultation under the aegis of
trade group ISDA. ""That would have taken quite a long time, and at the end
of the day these are bilateral contracts,"" said Guy America, European head
of credit derivatives trading at JP Morgan Chase.

Both banks intend to use the agreement in their default swap trades with
other dealers and expect it eventually to prove popular throughout the
market.  ""I don't see any reason going forward why it would not be rolled
out to end users of the product,"" said Annabel Littlewood, European head of
credit derivatives trading at Morgan Stanley.

She added that JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to use the new
master document in trades between their New York dealing desks, with
amendments to be made for local market practice.
US dealers typically use the modified definition of restructuring as a
credit event, and two weeks ago they dropped the use of the obligation
acceleration clause as a standard feature of default swaps.

Banks move to boost credit derivatives liquidity 
Risk News - November 23, 2001 
By John Ferry

JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have agreed to standardise most of the
items on their European credit swap master agreements, in a move designed to
increase liquidity in the credit derivatives market.

By cutting the widely used International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) documentation down from several pages to just one, the banks aim to
minimise the time taken to execute and confirm a trade while reducing
documentation risk. ""Frequent credit swap traders will be able to increase
the volume of confirmed trades, thereby increasing market liquidity and
growth of the credit derivatives business,"" said the banks in a joint
statement. 

Standard ISDA master agreements for credit swaps have 30 negotiable items.
JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley's shortened version leaves only eight items
open to discussion. The banks said the one-page confirmation form contains
only the ""key commercial terms"", including the name of the underlying
company, the notional involved and the price and duration of the trade. The
banks claim this will eliminate the risk of a party missing a modified term
or adding terms that were not previously agreed. 

Guy America, head of European credit derivatives trading at JP Morgan Chase
in London, said the development of the credit derivatives market will
receive a boost as a result of the agreement. ""The new agreement now looks
very similar to an interest rate swap contract,"" he said. 

Annabel Littlewood, head of European credit derivatives trading at Morgan
Stanley in London, said it took around a year to finalise the agreement.
""It's been quite a struggle getting to the point where dealers agree on the
major terms in the contracts.""

Fitch Plans Credit Hiring Spree
Derivatives Week - November 26, 2001

Fitch plans to hire six or seven collateralized debt obligation
professionals for its London-based CDO rating team because of the increase
in the number of deals coming to the market. Mitchell Lench, senior director
in London, said it has about 15 CDOs in the pipeline this month in
comparison to five or six this time last year, approximately one-third of
these are synthetic or balance sheet transactions.

Lench expects the new recruits to start in the first half of next year and
to come from structuring houses, investment firms or competitors. The hires
will include a lawyer familiar with the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association's documentation. There are currently 10 professionals in the CDO
team in London. Lench said it is becoming easier for rating agencies to hire
top personnel because the wage differential between the agencies and the
sellside firms has decreased. He added recruits also join rating agencies
for job security and to get a bird's eye view of the market.

Cross-Border Security Transactions Costing More Than Domestic Ones, EC Says 
BNA - November 26, 2001

Despite an increase in the demand for securities by foreign investors
because of the euro, there is a highly fragmented system in the European
Union when it comes to cross-border clearing and settlement, concluded a new
report published Nov. 23 on behalf of the European Commission. 

Moreover, the cost of clearing and settling a foreign security transaction
can be 10 times as much as a domestic sale.  ""There is no European financial
market right now and one has to wake up to this reality,"" said Alberto
Giovannini, the chairman of a group that wrote the report.

Legislative Proposal Planned

As a result of the report, the EU executive body said it will begin a
legislative process in 2002 to reverse the inefficiencies in the EU system.
At the same time, the commission urged financial markets to find
market-based solutions within the framework of the EU competition law. 

""The additional cost and risk associated with a fragmented clearing and
settlement infrastructure represents a significant limitation on the scope
for cross-border securities trading in the EU,"" said EU Economics
Commissioner Pedro Solbes. ""By extension it also represents an important
limitation on exploiting the economic benefits of the internal market and
the euro.""

Three Main Problems Cited

The three main problems highlighted in the report are as follows: 

	*	national differences in technical requirements and market
practice; 
	*	national differences in tax procedures; 
	*	issues relating to legal certainty.

While the report says financial markets could do much when it comes to
convergence and ensuring inter-operability as regards technical requirements
and market practices across national systems, it is up to governments and
the European Commission to deal with matters related to taxation and legal
certainty.

Enter the FSA 
Financial Times - November 26, 2001

Midnight on Friday will be a historic moment for Britain's financial
services industry. At that hour its new system of regulation under the
Financial Services Authority will come fully into effect, more than four
years after it was first proposed by the Labour government. How the FSA
handles its new powers, such as personal fines for wrongdoing by directors,
will have a profound impact on the City of London and its place as a global
financial centre. It will be closely watched by countries considering a
similar move.

The legislation that created the FSA - rightly amended to curb its powers to
punish - is broadly sensible. The authority replaces 10 self-governing
industry bodies that have not always regulated consistently or with
sufficient bite. The aim is to make regulation more efficient and more alert
to the scandals that have regularly plagued the City.

The legislation leaves wide discretion to the authority. But Sir Howard
Davies, its chairman, has promised a new and sensible risk-based approach:
resources will be focused on preventing problems where failure is most
likely rather than on routine visits to well run companies. Better
businesses should enjoy a lighter regulatory touch.

That is fine in principle but the City awaits the new policeman with
apprehension. There are three main worries. First, that it will prove
heavy-handed. There are widespread complaints that while senior FSA staff
are excellent, more junior ones still suffer from a box-ticking mentality.
Compliance costs, it is said, have been rising - a particular worry for
small companies. Second, there is concern that the authority may stretch
itself too thinly. A recent report on Equit-able Life criticised the FSA's
role, including its poor internal co- ordination.

Third, there is a fear the FSA will adopt an excessively aggressive approach
in its pursuit of wrong-doing, particularly for the newly created offence of
""market abuse"", and might go for some early high-profile scalps. The
authority denies this, as well it might. A reputation for inquisitions would
serve it ill.

Some of the City's concerns stem from natural tensions between regulator and
regulated. But the FSA, which can sometimes appear overly sensitive to
criticism, needs to be alert to these anxieties if it is to start on the
right note.

The main test will be to produce a flexible, low-cost regime that is firm
yet fair, while encouraging innovation and London's growth as a global
centre. This will be a difficult balance - but the FSA's short life so far
offers hope that it will get it broadly right.

FSA to open securitised derivatives to retail sector 
Risk News - November 21, 2001
  
The UK's financial watchdog, Financial Services Authority (FSA), plans to
allow retail investors to invest directly in securitised derivatives for the
first time by initiating a flexible listing regime.

The proposals, which will be relevant to issuers of listed securities and
derivatives, have been released in a consultation paper, 'Proposed Listing
and Conduct of Business Rules for Securitised Derivatives', after
discussions with market participants and international regulators. 

The idea to list retail covered warrants was first raised by the FSA in
January this year. The new proposals offer a wider and more flexible regime
that includes other types of derivatives. The paper details the
determination of who can issue securitised derivatives and the information
about these products that must be disclosed. 

The FSA's proposals focus on establishing the suitability of retail
investors to purchase securitised derivatives and the qualification of IFAs
(independent financial advisers) and brokers to advise on derivatives. The
listing of securitised derivatives will also include a risk warning with
full disclosure of the risks associated with these products, alongside
details of the product, how it works and how the investor's return is
calculated. Issuers of securitised derivatives will also need to be
regulated by the FSA and permitted to conduct business in derivatives. 

Ken Rushton, director of listings at the FSA, said: ""Market participants
believe there will be a demand for these products, which are very popular in
some European countries. The FSA believes there is the potential for the
market in the UK for these products to be substantial if UK investors show a
similar appetite for these products as they have for other products such as
spread betting and options.""
 
Dealers hope for clarity on swap books
IFR - November 24, 2001

Some clarification is expected this week on how the US courts may rule on
the Internal Revenue Service's challenge to dealers' methods for valuing
income from swaps. Closing arguments in Bank One Corporation v Commissioner
are set to begin on Wednesday.

Although no decision is expected before March or April next year, the nature
of the questions asked by the judge during the closing arguments may be
telling, industry executives believe.

The IRS's case is that the method for valuing First Chicago's swaps
portfolio between 1991 and 1993 included inappropriate downward adjustments
for credit risk and administrative costs. This, the IRS alleges; led the
dealer to underestimate the value of its income from derivatives, and
thereby reduced its taxable income base.  Bank One acquired First Chicago
more than three years ago.

Bank One claims that the method used was common practice at the time. In a
brief filed this summer the bank also said that its numbers were more
accurate with the adjustments than without. It is proposing to use an
adjusted mid-market approach to valuing income from swaps.

To the annoyance of some in the derivatives industry, the IRS's 600-page
brief submitted in September did not tell dealers what recipe they should
use for valuing income from swaps. ""They only put forward a brief saying
that the way Bank One did it was wrong,"" one firm's lawyer said. ""[The
government's position] can't be applied somewhere else. And it doesn't tell
an IRS agent how to audit [another dealer].""

The IRS was not under any obligation to come up with a better method, though
this would have been helpful, the lawyer said.  The problem with an
across-the board use of a mid-market approach of the type used by Bank One
is that banks using this approach rarely mark up their valuations because of
their own credit risk, said Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at
Stanford University's business school who is one of two court-appointed
experts for the case.

One partial way to address this would be to disallow mark-downs from
mid-market value when a counterparty has the same or higher credit quality,
said Duffie. Under a slightly more refined guideline, banks would mark down
swaps based on the credit quality of its counterparty relative to its own
quality.

""For example, if an A rated bank issuing debt at 20bp over Libor signs a
swap with an A- counterparty issuing at 50bp over Libor, then the swap could
be marked down based on a mean (relative) loss rate of 50-20=30bp per year,
per dollar of expected exposure,"" said Duffie.

""This is not text-book perfect, but would capture the majority of the effect
of relative quality. [Also] it would not require new software, just a shift
in model inputs for mean loss rates.""

"RE: 2002 IT Budgets","Mark - Louise Kitchen put your name down as the sponsor for all EA IT legal projects.  All EA IT projects were reviewed & approved Tues. & Wed. by the sponsors except the 2 that had your name by them.   Cornelio and I tried to catch you Tues. & Wed. via phone calls & emails to review them with you, but with no luck. Louise is reviewing the final EA IT budget today.

I apologize for you being put into the middle of all this by Louise, but I wanted to give you all the information that I could about the projects before Louise reviews them today.  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	RE: 2002 IT Budgets

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

"RE: Material Contract Review -- ASAP","Nora:
 
My first thoughts are to review the Solar Noncompetition Agreement (noncompete regarding the manufacture of photovoltaic cells in connection with the sale of Enron's 50% interest in the Amoco/Enron Solar Partnership to BP Amoco), the NewPower Noncompetition Agreement and the ServiceCo Noncompetition Agreement (EES new facility services venture).  My recollection is that the NewPower Noncompete and the ServiceCo Noncompete allow defeasance of the noncompetition provisions by permitting the investors to have put rights at fair market value (in other words, the noncompete provisions will bind a successor unless the investor honors the put rights).  It has been some time since I reviewed the Solar Noncompete, but I believe it could bind a successor if a third party merged or consolidated with Enron Corp., as opposed to a stock or asset purchase.  I also need to check the expiry date of this agreement, as it may be close to expiration.

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES
	*	Documentation Into The Future - FOW
	*	The Direction for Derivatives - FOW

Documentation Into The Future
FOW - October 2001
By Alessandro Cocco and Joe Kohler

Credit derivatives are instruments used for buying or selling the risk that
an obligor defaults on one or more specific obligations. In this article, we
will examine the foundation stone that underpins the vast majority of credit
derivative documentation, the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions,
pointing out some of the documentation's key features and where they have
already been refined.

The definitions are a set of contractual provisions that can be incorporated
by reference into confirmations relating to credit derivatives that take the
form of single name default swaps. This allows parties to a transaction to
use a short form of confirmation containing only the economic and
deal-specific terms relating to that transaction.  The objective of this
structure is to provide market participants with a tool for producing
documentation that is sufficiently sophisticated to deal with the majority
of issues arising from such transactions, simple enough to facilitate rapid
processing, and cost effective. The definitions achieve this by codifying
market practices, but more importantly, the prospect of their generation
helped to focus minds on establishing some of these practices in the first
place.

As with all ISDA documentation, the definitions allow for numerous elections
to be made by the parties, and the parties are also free to make whatever
amendments or additions they agree by inclusion in the confirmation of
appropriate language. The definitions also provide for a number of fallbacks
to apply in case the parties do not specify otherwise.

Market participants recognise the particularly important role of
documentation in the credit derivatives market. As a consequence of the
Russian and Asian financial crises, it became clear that in the case of
credit derivatives, more than for other derivative transactions, the payment
of large sums of money may depend on the interpretation of the wording of a
specific clause.

The 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions

Scope
The definitions apply to credit default swaps relating to obligations for
the payment of money by a reference entity.With appropriate modifications,
the definitions can also be used to document credit derivative transactions
that refer to baskets of reference entities, or to form the basis of
documents relating to funded products. In a transaction, the party buying
credit risk protection, or buyer, undertakes to pay the seller of protection
a predetermined amount. In return the seller undertakes to make a payment in
favour of the buyer in case the defined credit events occur. Credit events
serve as indicators of the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the
reference entity.

One of the main characteristics of a credit derivative is that the buyer
does not have to suffer a loss as a result of a credit event in order to
qualify for the payment from the seller. For example, A buys from B the
right to receive from B a payment of $10m in case company X is subject to
bankruptcy proceedings or does not repay loan Y If company X undergoes
bankruptcy proceedings or loan Y is not repaid, a credit event occurs. The
occurrence of one of these events, in circumstances involving the
satisfaction of any other condition to payment that the parties may have
specified in the transaction, would give A the right to receive from B the
agreed payment, irrespective of whether A had any credit exposure to company
X or loan Y.
This feature is of crucial importance to the determination of the regulatory
environment applicable to credit derivatives. In the UK if entering into
credit derivatives transactions constituted the carrying on of insurance
business, there would be a requirement for authorisation under the Insurance
Companies Act 1982. The fact that a buyer of a credit derivative does not
have to hold the obligations in question in order to obtain a payment from
the seller means that the credit derivative does not fall within the scope
of this legislation. This analysis was set out in full in a legal opinion
obtained by ISDA in 1997.

Reference entity
It is essential that the reference entity is identified with sufficient
precision. For example, to what extent are successors or affiliates of an
entity to be included? This point is particularly important when dealing
with a sovereign.What, if any, governmental agencies or authorities should
be included within this definition?

The demerger of National Power last year led to further debate surrounding
the definition of successor. National Power shifted a large number of
obligations to a new company called Innogy. Following the demerger, Innogy
became a stronger credit than National Power had been beforehand, and
National Power, in its new guise, became weaker. As a consequence, buyers
and sellers of credit protection in relation to National Power had opposing
views, from a commercial perspective at least, as to which was the
successor. ISDA is now looking into further refinements to the concept of
successor.

Credit events
The buyer and seller may buy and sell credit risk defined by reference to
different types of credit events. It is appropriate that both select
carefully the type of event on which they wish to trade. The definitions
offer a menu that comprises (1) failure to pay, (2) acceleration or default,
(3) repudiation/moratorium, (4) restructuring (in each case in respect of
one of the obligations identified in the confirmation) and (5) the
bankruptcy of the reference entity. In the case of all but the last of these
the parties can choose to implement a type of materiality threshold by
agreeing a payment requirement or default requirement that has to be crossed
before the credit event is deemed to have occurred.

The parties may consider the definitions' menu to be in need of amendment or
supplement in order to deal with the specific credit risk they wish to
trade. For example, the bankruptcy credit event focuses on events that
corporate obligors could experience and would require tailoring if the
Reference Entity were to take some other legal form.  The definition of
restructuring was one of the most controversial provisions in the drafting
process that led to the definitions. In the forerunner of the definitions,
ISDA's 1998 long form of confirmation, restructuring was defined by
reference to events that had the effect of making the terms of the relevant
obligation materially less favourable from an economic, credit or risk
perspective. This definition was generally considered to be too subjective,
and had given rise to a number of disputes.  The new definition now refers
to more objective criteria, such as a -reduction in the amount of principal
or premium.  A degree of subjectivity is, however, retained in that events
that would otherwise fall within the definition of restructuring do not
constitute a restructuring if they do not result directly or indirectly from
deterioration in the creditworthiness or financial condition of the
reference entity.

However, the market's disquiet regarding restructuring was not quelled by
these changes, and this recently gave rise to ISDA publishing a
Restructuring Supplement. The supplement restricts the types of obligation
to which restructuring can apply. It clarifies issues that the definitions
were not clear on and places certain additional parameters on the ways in
which a transaction can settle following a restructuring credit event.

Obligations
Apart from the bankruptcy of the reference entity, the question of whether a
credit event has occurred is determined by reference to obligations
identified in the confirmation. The definitions introduce a matrix system
based on the choice of one obligation category, and, if appropriate, one or
more obligation characteristics. The aim of this structure is to introduce
flexibility into the documentation process. The obligation categories are:

payment, borrowed money, reference obligations only, bond, loan, or bond or
loan. It is possible to give a very wide definition of obligations by
selecting payment (any obligation for the payment or repayment of money). On
the other hand it is possible to specify that credit events are only
relevant if they occur with reference to only one obligation, the reference
obligation. Choosing one or more obligation characteristics has the effect
of restricting the field of obligations in relation to which a credit event
may occur, because an event will be relevant only if it occurs in relation
to obligations of the chosen category, and which have the chosen
characteristics. Examples of obligation characteristics are: specified
currency, not domestic currency, not domestic law

Conditions to payment
The fact that a credit event has occurred is not sufficient to trigger the
payment of credit protection. Before that can occur, certain conditions to
payment must be satisfied. The definitions set out three conditions
involving the service of notice. A credit event notice must be served in any
transaction before the credit protection will become payable. The parties
may choose that a notice of publicly available information must be served to
cite news sources that confirm the occurrence of a credit event. Finally, if
the transaction is to settle physically, a notice of intended physical
settlement must be served by the buyer.

Term of a transaction
A credit event notice must refer to a credit event that occurs during the
term of the transaction. The term
begins on the effective date and ends on the scheduled termination date,
both of which are agreed by the parties in the confirmation. However, where
the credit event is a failure to pay, the credit event must be continuing at
the end of any applicable grace period or three days, whichever is the
longer. This requirement is intended to avoid a credit event being triggered
by a technical default, but it means that a default could have occurred on
or before the scheduled termination date, even though the grace period is
still pending at that time. The definitions provide that the parties have
two options in these circumstances. They may either postpone the end of the
term of the transaction beyond the scheduled termination date to the end of
the grace period, at which point, if the failure to pay is continuing, a
credit event notice may be served. Alternatively, they may agree that the
grace period must have expired before the scheduled termination date or no
credit event notice may be served. The latter is the fallback provision,
which applies unless the parties agree otherwise.

Physical and cash settlement
The parties agree at the outset whether cash settlement or physical
settlement applies to the relevant credit derivative transaction. These are
different means of realising the protection bought by the buyer where a
credit event actually occurs. If cash settlement applies, the payment to be
made by the seller to the buyer may be an amount fixed in advance or, more
usually, an amount to reflect the drop in value of the reference obligation
as determined by way of a dealers' poll. In the case of a physical
settlement, the buyer will deliver to the seller certain types of
obligations - deliverable obligations - against payment of a fixed amount,
usually the face value of those obligations.

The buyer realises its protection because it delivers to the seller assets
that are worth less than their face value, but obtains payment of full face
value from the seller. Physical settlement is widely used in the market,
because it avoids having to determine the exact market value of the relevant
obligation, and in circumstances where a credit event has occurred it may be
difficult to assess the drop in value of the reference obligation for the
purpose of cash settlement. On the other hand, some buyers may prefer cash
settlement because if the buyer has selected physical settlement and is
unable to obtain suitable deliverable obligations to deliver due to, for
instance, a squeeze of liquidity in the market, the buyer may lose some or
all of the protection it had under the credit derivative.

Deliverable obligations
Deliverable obligations are defined, as is the case for obligations, by
choosing one deliverable obligation category and any relevant deliverable
obligation characteristic. Although they are defined in the same way,
obligations and deliverable obligations play different roles. Whereas
obligations are what the parties refer to in order to assess whether a
credit event has occurred (other than in the case of bankruptcy),
deliverable obligations come into play only as a settlement tool and if the
parties have specified that physical settlement applies. The two do not need
to be the same.

Future developments
ISDA is working on producing dispute resolution guidelines. It is also
preparing a user's guide to the definitions. A goal in the future is to
expand the definitions to govern more types of credit derivatives.
Assembling market consensus support for such developments has proved tricky.
As a result, ISDA has recently introduced a new approach to the compilation
of standard documents involving the inauguration of a small working party to
make recommendations to the rest of the market. This working party,
nicknamed the G6, is formed of institutions representing constituencies on
both sides of the Atlantic and different parts of the market. The agenda it
has set itself includes review of other parts of the definitions including
the bankruptcy, repudiation/moratorium, acceleration and default credit
events, language for zero coupon bonds and convertible bonds, and a
clarification of the successor definition, with a view to producing further
supplements or guidance as to what constitutes market standard on various
issues. Developments expected to be implemented in the coming months will
show whether the C 6 approach is more efficient than the previous collegiate
approach.The credit derivatives market will continue to mature and expand.
These developments will mean that refining the definitions is a continuing
process that will inspire fierce debate.


The Direction for Derivatives
FOW - October 2001

There are several ongoing have hindered the development of credit
derivatives. Lack of a single body to oversee disputes, and concerns about
risk exposure transparency have all added to a reluctance by some financial
services organisations to use them. As a result, the development of
underlying technology supporting credit derivatives has progressed more
slowly than in other banking industry areas. But this looks likely to
change.

One of the major reasons for this is that the use of credit derivatives is
--beginning to climb. According to the Bank of England, the notional
principal outstanding exceeds $1 trillion globally. And the British Bankers'
Association says the credit derivatives market has grown from an estimated
$40 billion outstanding notional value in 1996 to an estimated $740bn at the
end of 2000.

This increase is being driven by various developments in the banking
industry, not least the push for transparency. Other key factors include the
need for banks to:
*	Diversify their risk portfolio, which is particularly important in a
recession or slowdown to limit exposure to individual market sectors
*	Achieve straight through-processing (STP) to improve efficiency and
cost savings
*	Demonstrate to regulators that they meet capital adequacy
requirements
*	Ensure an integrated, single view of investment and risk

As our current economic situation worsens, exposure to credit risk grows and
the use of financial instruments such as credit derivatives is increasing
This has coincided with growing pressure in recent years for financial
institutions to automate and integrate all their applications and processes
to meet regulatory requirements, minimise risk and keep pace with
technological innovation.

Recent market developments
Although not widely used, the advent of online credit derivatives trading
exchanges such as Creditex.com, CreditTrade.com and CreditDimensions.com is
a significant indication that the market is growing.

The exchanges are backed by major players. Creditex, founded in April 1999,
for example, has equity
investment and support from Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of
America among others, while CreditDimensions' eclectic mix includes
Algorithmics, Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing and Standard and Poor's.
Prebon Yamane and Internet Capital Group are among -the supporters of
CreditTrade.com, And a new entrant, Eprimus.com, is expected to join the
fray later this year, intending to act as a creator and investor by selling
credit protection in the form of default swaps on more than 1,500
investment-grade names.

These online exchanges also highlight the need for integrated systems,
particularly as banks are notorious for the number and diversity of
platforms and applications used.

Integration interlude
In the past, financial organisations have relied on spreadsheets to record
-credit derivatives transactions. And for most this is still the case. Yet
as STP and risk management become even higher on the agenda, so too does the
push for technologies that can effectively automate and manage transactions.
Banks must ensure that all processes are fully integrated and that back and
middle offices can keep pace with front offices. However, given the plethora
of proprietary trading platforms used by banks, offerings must be easily
designed, built and integrated into core systems to be a worthwhile
investment. Electronic initiation, execution and settlement is essential. It
is therefore crucial that any credit derivatives solution is:
	*	Open
	*	Scalable
	*	Stable
	*	Flexible
	*	Easy to integrate
	*	Future-proof

Software today
So what's on the market so far? Some vendors are pushing end-to-end
solutions while others are focusing on packaged, component-based solutions,
which can be 'bolted on' to core systems. And other vendors say their
solutions can be bought as a standalone module or as part of a suite.

Leading players so far include Front Capital, Murex, Summit, SunGard and
Savvysoft. The US companies appear to be benefiting from first mover
advantage in the UK marketplace at this stage. Current suppliers tend to be
global organisations with an HQ in New York. One exception is Front Capital
Systems, which has an office in London as well as in New York, Stockholm,
Frankfurt, Zurich and Johannesburg.

Many of the vendors are pushing front-to-back-office solutions covering cash
and derivatives trading as well as foreign exchange, energy and commodities,
equities and interest rates. Front Arena, from Front Capital Systems, for
example, combines fixed income, asset swap and interest rate derivative
capabilities with credit derivative functionality. With high yielding
securities and credit derivatives in the same system, monitoring all
positions simultaneously becomes easier.

Some vendors, such as Murex, offer a suite of integrated front and back
office systems sharing the same middle and back office platform. The
solution offers integrated, front-to-back office software solutions for cash
and derivatives trading and processing in fx, energy and commodities,
equities and interest rates. This includes listed, over-the- counter (OTC)
and exotics derivatives on securities and fx.

Summit's credit derivatives module can be run as a standalone application or
as part of a product suite and supported instruments include credit swaps,
credit- linked bonds, risky bonds (theoretical valuation) and forward bonds
purchase (binding and non-binding). Features include default probabilities
and recovery rates.

Vendors including SunGard and Savvysoft have created component-based
offerings. SunGard's Credit Derivatives Components module provides a
'building-block' asset, allowing any possible credit derivative product to
be structured and managed in a portfolio.

The module aims to offer staff the ability to structure, price, analyse,
trade and risk manage a variety of credit derivative instruments. It
supports several credit derivative instruments, including credit default
swaps, credit spread options and total rate of return swaps. The
functionality includes the ability to:
	*	Touch - Pay/receive par amount at the time a credit event
occurs
	*	End - Pay/receive par amount at the end of the contract's
life if a credit event occurs
	*	Annuity - Pay/receive a fee from the time a credit event
occurs until the maturity of the contract
	*	Fee Pay/receive a fee from the start of the contract until
the first of either a credit event occurring or contract maturity

And risk management is not forgotten. The solution emphasises the importance
of analytical integrity and the ability to support enterprise-wide risk
management. It includes risk measures for credit derivatives commensurate
with other interest-rate sensitive instruments such as bonds, caps and
swaps. This means that risk can therefore be aggregated across asset classes
and/or on a portfolio or enterprise-wide level. There is also an option to
produce specific credit derivatives reports.

Savvysoft's TOPS suite of products comprises nearly 70 OTC and
exchange-traded derivatives models. Savvysoft's newest product, TOPS Credit,
is geared to handling many types of credit derivatives, including total rate
of return swaps, credit default swaps, credit linked notes, credit spread
options and others. Like Summit, Savvysoft takes default probabilities into
account. In addition to letting the user specify the probability of an
issuer default, TOPS Credit can also base its calculations on the
probability of counterparty default and the correlation between these two
probabilities. The probabilities include functions of time, interest rate
levels and stock price levels to give users control over credit derivatives
valuations

Huge opportunity
The credit risk transfer market has the potential to increase the overall
robustness of the global financial system over time. But to do this, it is
essential that financial institutions can rely on a stable, scalable,
flexible solution that can be easily managed and integrated into core
systems.

The growing popularity of credit derivatives will offer IT vendors an
opportunity to extend their reach within financial institutions. But we are
currently at the early stages. The credit derivatives instrument is still in
development and the market is wide open for technology vendors particularly
UK based suppliers  to enter. This is an emerging market and we have a long
way to go before we know who will be the leader in this space and how it
will develop.

I believe this is in relation to the costs for Phase I of the legal website, including development costs.  

If so, it seems all Net Work costs were previously billed to one project code and not tracked per project.  I have discussed this with Kevin Presto and others in IT.  The problem is they want use to pay for X% of the costs based upon an estiamte that we incurred X% of the time associated with those costs.  I have consistently told IT that I needed to have more concrete numbers and support before I can bring it to you for approval and payment.  

If Louise's e-mail is about this subject, I'll continue to follow the same line until I am able to get sufficient back-up to support the fees.

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

"11/30 and 12/3 DPR - update as of 12/15/01","For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, & VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by the middle of next week.

The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to position reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.  I expect the issue to be resolved by the middle of the afternoon today and we will report shortly thereafter.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.

Thank you,

bob,
i am a supporter.  in our dealings we see the bank as a growing user of
derivatives and feel comfortable with the separation from the FSA.  the new
role the bank plays is more akin to what some of the other central banks in
europe do rather than the fed or boj.

Subject: Bank of England Application


Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received
an
application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we
have
considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,
consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives
activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely
to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have
generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark
and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have
even
admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we
let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA
materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there
may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.

In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been
expressed
if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for
membership.
These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the
regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to
influence the process.

Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of
England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has
correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional
central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market
and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.

In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously
expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the
application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the
Hong
Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received
an application.

Please share your views with the other members of the Board.

Bob

"Project Notre Dame - Change in Control","The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.  Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.  Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?  Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.  Thanks.

RISK MANAGEMENT

A spanner in the works 
Risk - December 2001

When the Basel Committee issued its second consultative document proposals
(CP2) for a new regulatory capital Accord in January, it prompted fierce
opposition from banks, academics and lobbying groups over its treatment of
loans to small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This sector is the
backbone and growth engine of many major economies. Now, nearly a year
later, the issue has come to a head. The US and Germany - which is fiercely
protective of its SME sector, the mittelstand - are engaged in brinkmanship
over the capital treatment of loans to SMEs that could cause the entire
Basel II capital Accord to unravel.

SME lenders' initial concerns included the steepness of Basel's credit risk
weighting curve for the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, its
insistence that expected loss provisions should be made in addition to
typical unexpected loss provisions, confusion over which SME loans could be
included under the retail approach, and the extent to which physical
collateral could be used as a risk mitigant. The Committee has moved to
address many of these concerns, although some, like the risk weighting
curve, remain prickly. But a critical issue, the use of maturity adjustments
in the calculation of capital charges for corporate and SME lending, which
requires banks to put aside more capital for longer-dated loans, is far from
being settled.

The German banking industry in particular is worried that overly harsh SME
treatment would push up lending costs, thereby stifling capital to a vital
source of the country's economic growth. While German banks have several
concerns, the country's lack of flexibility on the maturity issue threatens
to derail the entire Basel II process, which in turn would throw the
European Directive based on Basel II into disarray.

While most Basel lobbying has been carried out via traditional banking
channels - with national banking associations petitioning their regulators
that sit on the Basel Committee and its working groups - the debate in
Germany, Europe's largest economy, involves the highest levels of
government. German chancellor Gerhard Schr?der and economics minister Werner
M?ller said in late October that German funding to the mittelstand must not
be impaired by Basel II. ""Basel II is not acceptable to Germany in its
present form. Everyone must reckon with our opposition to a European Union
guideline based on Basel II,"" said Schr?der, referring specifically to
treatment of SMEs.

The Basel Committee has since issued a paper, 'Potential modifications to
the Committee's proposals', which outlines current thinking within the
Committee and indicates that it will make key concessions to SME lenders.

The most important aspect of the paper, released November 5, is the
Committee's move to lower and flatten the IRB risk weighting capital curve -
which is a function of a firm's probability of default. This significantly
lowers capital requirements for SME lending. The move is based on evidence
that small companies are less likely than large corporates to default during
economic downturns.

But the paper failed to touch on the maturity debate. ""[It] says nothing
about maturity, just about the risk weights without any maturity
adjustments,"" says Tobias Winkler, head of international banking issues in
the department for banking supervision at the Bundesverband deutscher Banken
(Association of German Commercial Banks). ""This a right step, but certain
additional things have to be done to take account of special circumstances
of SME lending [in Germany],"" he adds. ""The maturity adjustment has to be
abolished in the advanced approach,"" he argues.

The German side claims the terms of loans to the mittelstand are
significantly longer than those to their SME counterparts in the US or the
UK.

""We have got very long maturities, this would put German banks at an
enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries,"" says
Winkler.

Evidence to support this argument is hard to come by, especially since the
Basel Committee refuses to disclose cross-country comparisons for factors
like average loan maturities from its second quantitative impact study (QIS
2). But several officials with access to QIS 2 data say the average maturity
of loans made by domestic financial institutions to businesses in Germany is
4.28 years, a figure that falls to 2.95 years for Germany's internationally
active banks. Average maturities for business loans in other G-10 countries
were said to lie between two and 2.5 years. 

The CP2 proposals for Basel II contained two maturity approaches in IRB
treatment, one called the 'default model', ironically said to be a German
proposal, and the other a US 'mark-to-market' approach strongly backed by
the British. Under these two approaches, it is assumed that the risk of
default on a loan is higher if it is longer-dated, an assertion that has
been supported by several studies of historic data. The 'mark-to-market'
approach also takes into account the economic deterioration of the position
and not just final default. This Anglo model heavily penalises longer-term
loans. According to the Zentraler Kreditausschus (ZKA), a central banking
association which represents the interests of German commercial banks,
savings banks, regional state banks and co-operatives, long-term exposures
of seven years could require up to six times as much capital as one year
exposures - although one German banking official said a cap had now been
placed on maturities at five years, reducing this figure to 400%. ""Capital
add-ons for long-term loans would therefore seriously affect the
international competitiveness of the German banking industry and result in
higher interest rates for borrowers that would not be justified by the risk
exposure,"" said the ZKA in a statement during the comment period.

But Germany stands virtually alone in its refusal to accept the US-led
maturity proposals. ""The data analysed by the Committee clearly shows that
you have these upward-sloping curves for maturities. What kills a bank is
deterioration of value, and it has got to provide for a lot of things on the
books, so you can't wait for final default,"" said a Basel Committee member.
""But you can argue about the steepness, and that is a matter for debate.""
The fact that Germany's other key allies in the wider SME debate - namely
Japan, Italy and Spain - are in favour of maturity adjustments, has prompted
a number of non-German regulators, albeit veiled behind the protection of
anonymity, to play down the importance of the maturity impasse to Basel II's
implementation. But such views fail to take into account the depth of
feeling that German banks, banking associations, the Bundesbank, parliament
and the general public have in protecting funding to the mittlestand. This
unusual level of pressure has left the German negotiators with very little
room for manoeuvre.

Gerhard Hofmann, director of banking supervision at the Deutsche Bundesbank,
was one of the few regulators prepared to speak publicly on the issue. He
said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate, and confirmed that
the German side would be prepared to scupper Basel II's timetable should a
deal fail to be reached. ""If this does not come to an end, then the European
effort will be postponed too. I have difficulties imagining that we would
introduce Basel II in Europe and not have a level playing field on a G-10
basis."" While Hofmann said the matter was ""very serious"", he remained
confident that all sides could reach a solution.

Risk was told by one European banking representative who claims to be
closely involved in the talks that a current compromise suggestion is to
halve the US mark-to-market maturity adjustments. This would mean the 600%
figure mentioned in the ZKA paper for a 'AAA'-rated, seven-year loan would
be reduced to 200%. But a US representative distanced himself from this
being a US proposal. ""I would not describe the negotiating position that
way,"" he said. Asked if the US team would agree such a concession, he added,
""I couldn't say that we would, but it would depend on the whole package.
Fifty per cent on the mark-to-market adjustment seems an obvious point to
try and compromise on, but I'm not sure the US side would agree to that.""

Hofmann was also cautious, saying ""I would rather hesitate to comment on
that, but yes, it is a direction we are heading. This is a critical point
and I hesitate to comment in public because we are in the midst of this
rather difficult negotiating process and I really don't want to jeopardise
anything. It will be quite tough.""  While almost every country that supports
maturity adjustments believes a 50% mark-down would be an acceptable
compromise, Germany may still hold out. Another German bank executive says
it may find a 50% mark-down unsatisfactory.

Another area of potential compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities
of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment,
while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at the
three-year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit
approach. 

But German bankers appear set to resist even this level of compromise,
claiming that German internationally active banks (with average maturities
of 2.95 years) would be on an unfair playing field with other
internationally active banks, which have average maturities closer to the
two years. But German banking officials could not come up with hard data to
support the claims.

While maturity is the largest single SME-related issue for the Basel
Committee to resolve, there are a number of other matters that also need
clearing up, and, once again, the Germans are digging in their heels. For
example, the IRB credit risk-weighting curve proposed by the Committee on
November 5 fails to completely assuage concern about higher SME lending
charges. While Basel's current approach would mean that banks would have to
set aside significantly less capital against SMEs, which typically fall in
the 1% to 3% probability of default range, compared with CP2 proposals,
charges are still higher than under the present rules. For example, a bank
lending to an SME with a 2% probability of default would now have to set
aside 10.3% of the capital, compared with 15.4% under the January proposals.

Collateral mitigation could reduce this to 9.3%, and receivables mitigation
might further reduce the amount to 8.3%.

But Hofmann believes this risk-weighting curve does not go far enough. ""When
you look at the curve, the typical probability of default range for an SME,
which is around 2%, still triggers a capital charge of above 10% - 2
percentage points above the current treatment,"" he says. This will translate
into the pricing of these loans. ""How big will the interest rate effect be
on SMEs? According to our calculations it is still significant,"" Hofmann
says.

As a result, the Bank of Italy and the Deutsche Bundesbank drafted a
confidential joint paper, released October 19, which was submitted to the
Committee's working group on overall capital. The paper proposes that a
function based on the relationship between asset correlation and size should
be added to the IRB risk-weight curve methodology based on the relationship
between asset correlation and probability of default. The paper,
'Calibration of benchmark risk weights in the IRB approach to regulatory
capital requirements', contends that joint treatment of probability of
default and a firm-size effects on asset correlation could produce a risk
weighting function that addresses both procyclicality issues produced by the
new framework and concerns related to the treatment of lending to SMEs. The
Committee is now investigating the matter as part of an additional
quantitative impact study, QIS 2.5.

But many banks, including German financial institutions, are strongly
opposed to the introduction of additional parameters, such as number of
employees, assets and turnover functions into the risk-weighting curve. They
see a size function as an unnecessary complication. ""Segmentation on the
grounds of turnover is unsatisfactory to us. Retail businesses and wholesale
businesses may have similar turnover, but the characteristics and the way
you would manage them in risk terms would be quite different,"" says Colin
Jennings, senior manager, non-retail related risk at Lloyds TSB, the UK's
third largest bank. ""If that was imposed on us we would have to change our
systems considerably to do what we think would achieve no real benefit,""
adds Simon Baker, Lloyds TSB's head of risk policy, overseeing about ?6
billion in commercial portfolios (above ?2 million in turnover) and an equal
amount in small business portfolios, plus retail loans to its 16 million
retail customers base.

Further effects
Bankers are also opposed to another key aspect of Basel II that affects SME
lending. The Committee believes banks should put aside capital for expected
losses in addition to the current practice of making capital charges against
unexpected losses - credit risk. From a theoretical view of capital, such
requirements should be fulfilled by future margin income and not by
regulatory capital allocations. The Germans favour this 'pure' approach.

""Expected losses are covered by future margin income. We don't need any
double counting by using regulatory capital to cover expected losses,"" says
a German banker.

Although Basel has made some concessions in this area, saying it would scrap
expected loss provisions for retail loans - excluding mortgages - and allow
deductions from special and general loan loss reserves against expected
losses, the Committee's 'inelegant solution' has again run into German
opposition. ""The German Ministry of Finance restricts the amount of
loan-loss reserves due to fears that banks would attempt to reduce their
income figures to avoid tax payments,"" says one German banker. ""We fear that
this could lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for
German banks because of tax regulations, so we are very much against
covering expected losses with regulatory capital.""

A potential solution is to include expected losses under Pillar II of Basel
II, leaving it up to the discretion of national supervisors to ensure
expected losses are fully covered, while ensuring a level playing field
among nations. But some claim the Committee is unconvinced that expected
losses are fully accounted for by national regulators in specific product
areas or nations like Japan, and have pushed for specific Pillar I treatment
to alleviate their concerns. ""The current envisioned compromise is that this
will not be done across the board. While it is not an elegant solution, it
addresses the most important substantive concerns the industry has raised
about the inclusion of expected loss,"" says a Basel Committee member.

The strong German opposition to so many SME-related treatments will make a
speedy resolution difficult, with much said to be hinging on sideline
discussions between the German and American contingents ahead of the Capital
Task Force and Basel Committee meetings, scheduled for December 6 and 7 in
New York, and the December 12 and 13 in Basel, respectively. With the timing
tight in terms of enshrining a European Directive in European Union and
European national legislation, the industry needs a major breakthrough based
on sound banking supervision practices, rather than an appeasement in
response to political sabre-rattling, which risks weighing down the entire
Basel II process.

ISDA and FpML.org to merge
Risk - December 2001
By Rob Dwyer
 
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association plans to integrate
FpML.org the not-for-profit company set up to develop Financial products
Markup Language (FpML) - into its organisational structure by the end of the
year. The merger of the two organisations is aimed at facilitating the
development of FpML by allowing FpML.orgs members to concentrate on
technical issues.

Mart Meinel, co-chair of FpML's standards committee and head of fixed-income
IT at UBS Warburg, says becoming part of ISDA will remove the burden of
administration from the technical team. We will be able to use ISDA
resources which will speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and the
development of version 3.0,' he says. 'The standards committee ended up
doing a lot of the administration work to run the FpML symposiums, and we
hope to leverage off ISDA conferences (for future symposiums).""

FpML based on the flexible extensible markup language' (XML), is designed to
create an industry standard for electronic trading. FpML 1.0, launched in
July 2000, covers interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.  FpML is
presently working on version 2.0, which will include swaptions, caps,
floors, collars and straddles, as well as several other instruments, as well
as those covered in 1.0.  Implementation is slated for the end of December.
The committee is also planning to publish a draft of 3.0, which will extend
FpML coverage to foreign exchange and equity derivatives, by the end of this
year.

Meinel says FpML's integration with ISDA was part of the standards
committee's strategy from the organisation's inception. 'Since we have been
working on ISDA documentation then converting that into XML, our work has a
natural fit with ISDA,"" says Meinel, Operating from inside ISDA will help
the development of FpML be better aligned with the documentation of new
products as it comes along.""

Strain
Robert Pickel, ISDA's chief executive officer, says the merger will allow
members of FpML to focus on technical development. But will it prove a
strain on often-stretched ISDA resources? We envision adding some extra
staff, and we project that we will be able to find the extra funding needed
through due-based revenues' says Pickel. ""As a volunteer organization, it
was an issue for FpML members to find time aside from their day jobs. And
yet they have still managed to establish FpML as a brand that is the basis
for OTC derivatives transactions in the future,"" he adds.

FpML users welcomed the announcement.  Mark Brickell, chief executive
officer of online swaps trading platform Blackbird, and chairman of lSDA
between 1988 and 1992, says: ""We actively encouraged ISDA to take on this
project.  Creating FpML is as important as the ISDA Master Swap Agreement,
because it will strengthen the framework for the swap negotiation.""
Brickell says Blackbird was the first company to offer FpML confirmations to
its customers, and he believes ISDA will accelerate the adoption of 2.0 and
expand FpML further to cover more kinds of transactions more quickly.

Observers say the success of the project depends on recruiting. An official
at an FpML-affiliated company says: ""ISDA hasn't had this level of
technology project before, so the key will he whether it hires someone with
the requisite level of technological expertise."" ISDA officials say details
about FpML recruitment have yet to be finalised.

"RE: Bank of England Application","bob,
i am a supporter.  in our dealings we see the bank as a growing user of
derivatives and feel comfortable with the separation from the FSA.  the new
role the bank plays is more akin to what some of the other central banks in
europe do rather than the fed or boj.

-----Original Message-----

Subject: Bank of England Application


Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received an
application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we have
considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,
consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives
activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely
to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have
generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark
and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have even
admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we
let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA
materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there
may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.
 
In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been expressed
if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for membership.
These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the
regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to
influence the process.
 
Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of
England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has
correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional
central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market
and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA. 
 
In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously
expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the
application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received
an application.
 
Please share your views with the other members of the Board.
 
Bob

TXU Sells Two Texas Power
Plants to Exelon; Sale Supports
Strategies of Both Companies 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from PRNewswire] TXU Corp. (NYSE: TXU) and Exelon Generation announced an agreement to sell two large TXU gas-fired electric generating plants to Exelon Generation, a subsidiary of Exelon Corp. (NYSE: EXC) for $433 million. The transaction, involving two Dallas/Fort Worth plants with a combined capacity of 2,334 MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its presence in the Texas region, enhancing its geographic and market diversity, while providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas. 

Analysis: Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the strategies of both companies particularly well. TXU, one of the largest generation companies in the world, has been attempting to expand out of its home state of Texas for some time, following competitive opportunities as they are presented by electric deregulation. The company, which will maintain a presence in the Texas market, has already expanded internationally into countries such as Australia and Europe, and will mostly likely use the proceeds from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the United States. For Exelon, the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Texas market, which becomes fully competitive next week, and provides a particularly valuable inroad into the high-demand region of Dallas/Fort Worth.

Let's first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is selling to Exelon. As noted, the combined capacity of the two plants is about 2,334 MW. One of the plants is the 1,441-MW Handley Steam Electric Station, which is located southeast of Fort Worth. According to TXU, 412,000 barrels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oil/gas units at the plant. Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington. The first unit was put into operation in 1948, with the additional units coming on line in 1950, 1963, 1976, and 1977. The other plant being sold is the 893-MW Mountain Creek Steam Electric Station, which is located about two miles west of Loop 12 in Dallas. With the first oil/gas unit established in 1945, four more units were added in 1949, 1956, 1958, and 1967. Both sales include the generating units of the plants, along with all of the other assets that are necessary for them to operate (land, water rights, transmission interconnections, gas pipeline interconnections, production facilities, and emission allowances).

The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pretty straightforward. From TXU's perspective, the sales will reduce the company's generation concentration in a single U.S. market, which up to this point has been primarily in its home state of Texas. Proceeds from the sale apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American markets outside of Texas. In addition, proceeds from the sale will be used to strengthen TXU's balance sheet by reducing debt, something that has become increasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy space since the bankruptcy of market-leader Enron. It is important to note that TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market, and still intends to operate in the state as a generation company and retailer. Note that according to Texas restructuring law, there must be a wall between the two operating units, which must function as separate companies. In essence, the divestiture is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that will support growth into other markets, and reduce the amount of potential market power that the company may have in Texas. 

The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the latter half of this year, considering that recent rulings by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have forced several other companies to charge cost-based prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to hold market power in their particular service territories. Texas law allows a company to own and control no more than 20 percent of capacity within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and TXU claims that it is within this cap. However, TXU acknowledges that it had an over-concentration of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other markets. Excluding the sold facilities, TXU will now own 18,651 MW of net capacity, which are still located primarily in Texas. However, it is becoming clear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market.

From Exelon's perspective, the sale expands the company's generating capacity by about 10 percent, which is an important increase considering that Exelon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industry's largest asset-based traders. Exelon, which was created as a result of the merger between PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison, is known mostly for its strong nuclear capabilities. In fact, Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, owning a total of 17 reactors that produce about 17,000 MW of power. Exelon may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio. Exelon Power, which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU, oversees Exelon's portfolio of coal, natural gas, oil, landfill gas, and hydro generating assets, which include 72 intermediate and peaking units in Pennsylvania and Maryland (capable of producing 4,800 MW of net generating capacity). Thus, Exelon's purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an effort to diversify, both regionally and from a power-source perspective, from the company's previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast. 

Perhaps equally important, the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas market, which represents the second-largest energy market (behind California), offering a market value of about $20 billion. Now that California is no longer a competitive energy market, there are high hopes that Texas will prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state next week. On Jan.1, 2002, most customers of investor-owned utilities in Texas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider (REP)-the company that provides their electricity. As a whole, the Texas energy market represents 70,000 MW of generation operating on a 37,000-mile transmission network. 

One of Exelon's main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation assets and position itself as one of the nation's top-tier energy suppliers. Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon, which up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago to Pennsylvania. This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into the Texas market. In the summer of 2001, Exelon began operating a new 165-MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston. Prior to that, Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from two other plants in Texas (830 MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and 350 MW from the Wolf Hollow plant).

It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas market, especially on the wholesale side of the business, and thus there are fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract. Under the sales agreement, Exelon Power, Exelon Generation's power plant operation arm, will assume operation of the plants. The transaction includes a tolling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase power during summer months for the next five years at market-based rates. Considering the standard definition of a tolling agreement, it is presumed that TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the summer months of the five-year contract, and then purchasing the electric output of the plants during that time. Interestingly, TXU is able to abide by Texas' requirement that it not own and control more than 20 percent within ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants. However, realistically, TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants, at least in the summer months during its five-year contract with Exelon. This raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract between TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas' deregulation plan.

Subject:	due diligence contacts

Lance-

We have had some discussions recently around the due diligence process and
have compartmentalized our desired search into roughly a dozen big-picture
areas.  These areas of interest are as follows:

- Corporate structure (minute books, corp secretary's function, etc.)
- Finance
- Pipeline assets (including the MLPs - EOTT and Northern Border)
- Generating assets
- Intellectual property
- Enron Broadband Services
- Insurance
- Trading book/Risk management
- Pending dispositions, plant/business closings, etc.
- Tax
- Accounting
- Human resources

If you could provide me with the names of the folks over at Enron that we
can contact for each of these areas, I would really appreciate it.  I have
not included real estate or environmental on the above list because I have
been told that Elizabeth Labinowski and David Nutt, respectively, are the
folks we should contact regarding such matters.

As for process, we are assembling a master request list that we expect to
forward to you by the end of next week.  While we think it is more
efficient to get the diligence done in small groups, we do want to get you
our request list so that you will know what we will be asking for and
perhaps be able to break the list up into its component parts for
distribution within your organization.

Thanks in advance for your assistance with respect to this process.  We
will do our best to make things as painless as possible for you.

Please call me if you have any questions.

bob,
i am a supporter.  in our dealings we see the bank as a growing user of
derivatives and feel comfortable with the separation from the FSA.  the new
role the bank plays is more akin to what some of the other central banks in
europe do rather than the fed or boj.

Subject: Bank of England Application


Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received
an
application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we
have
considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,
consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives
activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely
to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have
generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark
and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have
even
admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we
let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA
materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there
may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.

In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been
expressed
if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for
membership.
These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the
regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to
influence the process.

Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of
England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has
correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional
central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market
and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.

In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously
expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the
application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the
Hong
Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received
an application.

Please share your views with the other members of the Board.

Bob

CREDIT DERIVATIVES
ISDA publishes credit survey - Risk

ENERGY
Enron's Success Story - The Wall Street Journal
 
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association released its first
survey of the global over-the-counter credit derivatives market last month,
showing a total notional outstanding volume of credit derivative
transactions of $631.5 billion as of the end of the first half of this year.
ISDA, which compiled information from 83 firms, hopes the survey will
provide a benchmark from which to chart future growth in the credit
derivatives market. This survey, and the others that have been done by Risk,
the British Bankers' Association (BBA), the US Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (0CC) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have all
used different methodologies on different samples, and have generated
varying results.

Risk's survey last year showed significantly higher total notional volumes
$810 billion. The BBA survey released in July 2000 also gave a higher
figure, forecasting $893 billion for the end of 2000. The BJS plans to
publish its triennial figures on the credit derivatives market later this
year.

Upward trend
According to ISDA, while still modest in relation to interest rate products,
the credit derivatives market is expected to remain on a strong upward trend
compared to more mature derivatives product areas. Most major dealers say
there has been a big increase in their credit derivatives volumes.  Mike
Brosnan, deputy comptroller of risk evaluation at the 0CC, pointed to a
challenge in assembling these surveys:
""When you conduct a survey, some people may or may not respond, hence the
data could be incomplete. 

A problem with a survey is: who is the enforcer?' The OCC. which carries out
its own quarterly review of the US derivatives market, showed a decline in
the credit derivatives market, from $426 billion at the end of 2000 to $351
billion at the end of second-quarter 2001.
Brosnan attributes the decline in the credit derivatives market to
uncertainty among users, relating to restructuring issues sparked off by the
US life insurer Conseco's debt restructuring last year. However, according
to Tim Frost, head of JP Morgan's credit derivatives business in London, the
decline evidenced in the OCC's figures really comes down to a change in
reporting methods that occurred in 2000 from gross-to-net notional figures
on outstanding credit derivatives contracts. 


Enron's Success Story
The Wall Street Journal - December 26, 2001

The collapse of Enron was many things -- a gratifying slap in the face to
corporate hubris and an exposure of the Alfred E. Neuman club of stock
analysts, rating agencies and the SEC. It may even prove to be a fascinating
look into criminal minds. But there is one thing, for sure, it wasn't -- a
market failure. To the contrary, Enron's implosion was confirmation of the
principles that govern competitive markets.

Enron's success and failure ran along the lines set down in any
microeconomics text. The company discovered a new product -- mostly ways of
trading energy in the derivatives market -- that allowed producers and users
to lay off risk. This new product was wildly popular and, as the innovator,
Enron made lovely above-market returns. But those abnormal returns attracted
other firms into the business and Enron's advantage was gradually ""competed
away."" Each new market entrant put the squeeze on Enron's margins.

What happened next is still a matter of speculation, but there are several
theories that seem reasonable.

Bad hedging. Although Enron started out as a plain vanilla energy company,
it shed those hard assets that could have underpinned its financial business
and morphed into a trading company and then, quickly, into a hedge fund. 

The Dismal Science
 
A trading company can make money no matter which direction the market goes
by simply trading and taking its money from creating a market. If prices are
falling, then suppliers rush into the market to get contracts that nail down
prices; if prices are rising, then users rush in to get contracts. Traders
can make money either way. Indeed, in this model, a volatile market is the
best of all possible worlds.

But with its margins -- and cash -- getting squeezed, Enron started
borrowing money and pretty soon it was running with remarkable leverage,
thus becoming a giant hedge fund. When things started to go wrong, Enron's
traders quite possibly were panicked into trying to hit a home run. That is,
they started taking big bets on the direction of the market, perhaps taking
aggressively long positions in energy. A successful hedge fund, however,
depends on adequately hedging bets, especially leveraged ones. But as Enron
started to lose money on its big bets, observers guess that the
insufficiency of its hedges began to look lethal.

There are also more complicated theories that argue Enron was hiding its
slowing growth in earnings with various accounting strategies.

Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolved
around a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.
Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fair
value"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, the
futures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market with
clear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies can
vastly inflate value. 

These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. In
September 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look at
Enron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron would
have had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,
unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company's
originally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in the
quality of Enron's earnings.

When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enron
removed the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in special
entities created for just that purpose.

Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hard
assets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like its
broadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. In
order to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,
the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- either
with bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships
(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them off
Enron's balance sheet. 

Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enron
stock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of the
partnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisions
kicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholder
equity in November.

Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.

The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it is
entirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanos
of Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higher
than its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron's
managers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive markets
their ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had been
willing to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcy
today.

Enron's collapse also says something valuable about the energy trading
markets: Competitive markets worked just as expected. As questions were
raised about the quality of Enron's earnings -- and, just as important, not
answered -- investors grew wary. Although the stock opened the year trading
in the 80s, it started drifting down as investors bailed. The stock had
already lost half its value and was trading below 40 before the company
announced a big third-quarter loss and made its first disclosure of
accounting ""mistakes"" in October.

At the same time, traders outside the company had begun to unwind positions
and do business with other firms. At the end of September, Enron had 25% of
the energy-trading market. Just two months later, its business had
disappeared but that disappearance didn't cause the tiniest ripple in the
market. The swift collapse of what once was a $77 billion dollar company
failed to generate either a price spike or a supply interruption because the
market was sufficiently liquid and deep to absorb it.

In short, no matter how one views the purposes or operations of a
competitive market, the history of Enron proves that the market works pretty
much as expected. And thus the story of Enron is, so far, a success story.

The amount owed is $49,231.09.  This is almost all  on October bill for September time.  The responsible attorney in the Washington office, Sarah  Novosel  ((202) 466-9160 ; 828-3360-main), told me she had approved the  bill a couple of weeks ago.
 
At this time, we have not received notice of  payment.

"Dynegy Request","David,

Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.

In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.

Let me know your thoughts on this.  

Michelle

"Burr Oak Veneer...","From: Mark Whitney
TheLaw.net Corporation
Homepage: http://www.thelaw.net 
Remove: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     The Bentley Arnage Red Label is a beautiful four sedan, but it's not for everyone.
http://www.bentleymotors.co.uk/bentley/picture_gallery/bentley_2.jpg
True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut, burr oak, bird's eye maple or black lacquer veneer, most would still find the $200K+ sticker price out of reach. Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition. After all, burr oak veneer is still veneer.


WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH?

     Lawyers from coast-to-coast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control. Many, given their firm size, practice area or jurisdiction, simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis. Others have concluded, as one guesses they might with the Bentley, that after peeling back the veneer, these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth. 


THEORY vs. REALITY

     As nice as it might be to own a Bentley, it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school, just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access, only to yank the needle upon graduation.

     What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw? Perhaps more to the point, what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands? Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues? 

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary jurisdiction packages and thumbs its nose at the reality that you practice in a state like Vermont, for example, a jurisdiction that only issues about 100 new published opinions ANNUALLY, and not surprisingly has yet to consider anything remotely resembling your client's situation?

     Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search ALL states and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)


""I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!""

     And there you have our new favorite quote, from a new subscriber leaving a large firm to start her own thing. We have others; lots of them. See, http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

--Enter a statutory cite into the search engine, and pop up cases construing that item, in one mouse click. See, http://www.thelaw.net/statutes.htm

--Have a case citation you need to know more about? Find cases construing that item in one mouse click. Simple.

--Easy to use? Do you know how to operate a browser, shuttle through little windows folders and do electronic case law research? If so, you're on your way to being a guru using TheLaw.net. If you don't know how to perform these tasks, we will teach at no cost.

--PERFORM UNKNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Use Boolean and, or, not, near, within, adjacent, nesting, truncation See, Sample Searches: http://www.thelaw.net/searchdemo/home.htm
     
--PERFORM KNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Field search by cite, party, counsel, docket, author, date or panel.  See, http://www.thelaw.net/help/operators.htm


WHAT ABOUT WEST AND LEXIS?

     Pay them only when you have to. Will you still use Lexis or West from time to time? Sure. Probably. But perhaps you will get to the point where you use them on the web with your credit card, when you can't otherwise get the answer faster, cheaper elsewhere. Or maybe you like that West or Lexis Primary Jurisdiction Plan that you've been using all these years and you think TheLaw.net can provide a sort of meter insurance for those occasions where the circumstances call for a national look.

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

"VRAL Achieves unprecedented AIDS breakthrough","VIRAL GENETICS, INC.

	December, 2001
HIGHLIGHTS

*	Viral Genetics has developed a revolutionary new technology called 
TNP which, based on clinical results to date, not only stops but also 
reverses the progression of HIV infection in people.
*	TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear 
protein which, when purified and modified, greatly stimulates the 
body's immune response system.
*	Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 
terminally ill AIDS patients in clinical trials show virtually no sign of 
HIV infection.
*	TNP treated patients display virtually no side effects to treatment.
*	TNP technology is patented in 16 countries and patent pending in 
Canada and the U.S.
*	Treatments are far less costly and less cumbersome than currently 
employed alternatives.

OVERVIEW

Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize 
therapeutic and diagnostic systems for the treatment of viral diseases.  
Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop 
and reverse the progression of HIV infection in humans.  After 
expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their core 
technology - TNP (Thymus Nuclear Protein).

Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal 
studies and three human clinical trials.  Each human trial consisted of 10 
to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by 
intra-muscular injection bi-weekly over an eight week period.  Follow 
up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 667 days 
after treatment.  The trials revealed the following incredible results with 
respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:

-	HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after 
treatment.
-	Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which 
completely subsided after treatment and remained that way even 18 
months after treatment.
-	Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no 
Antiviral Drug Cocktail has shown any efficacy with whatsoever.
-	Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP 
treatment.

Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide 
governments to commercialize the TNP technology.

This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
 
The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.

"RE: Contract Settlement - Required Approvals","
This should not be a problem under the Merger Agreement so long as discontinuing the business unit/operation is ""prudent in Enron's good-faith business judgment"".  While that seems self-evident, we may want to document that language somewhere (in resolutions, a DASH, etc.) just to protect ourselves.  As to the payment, it is fine--and we don't need to track it--if the contract being terminated is not material.  Sounds like it isn't.

Subject:	Contract Settlement - Required Approvals

Lance -

It is my understanding that Enron Credit is currently closing down operations.  In light of this, EC has a contractual obligation to a company called Risk Metrics Group.  The obligation arises out of the development and hosting by RMG of a website devoted to the use of EC's credit risk data - the site being mainly focused toward subscribers to other RMG products.  Since we are terminating the development and hosting agreement - in essence shutting down the site - we will owe RMG approximately $96,000.

While I realize this is a small sum, I wanted to make sure (1) there are no approvals under the merger agreement that are required for a settlement of this nature and (2) if we are tracking this type of liability for merger purposes, that I provide the necessary information to the appropriate personnel.

Please let me know if either of the above are necessary.

Thanks.

Mark

From: 	Ephross, Joel  
Sent:	Monday, November 12, 2001 8:43 AM
To:	Mintz, Jordan; Haedicke, Mark E.
Cc:	Martin, Sophie
Subject:	Issuance of Letters of Credit

Jordan, in response to your questions concerning the issuance of letters of credit starting today, I think that the response needs to address two situations: the committed lc facilities [Chase and West LB] and the uncommitted facilities.

Since the uncommitted facilities involve minimal representations, they are not typically an issue [although we still need to review each circumstance individually], and unless there is a specific representation to Enron Corp.'s audited financials for the period 97-00 being prepared in accordance with GAAP, we should be able to issue letters of credit from an uncommitted facility.

However, sections 4.1(d) of each of  the West LB Facility and the Chase Facility contain a representation that Enron Corp.'s financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. This representation was false when made, and will always be false. Thus, there is an issue with an officer being able to make the representations and warranties necessary for an issuance of a letter of credit under one of these facilities [or for an extension of an existing letter of credit]. 

In order to utilize the committed facilities, it will be necessary to obtain an amendment or waiver of this representation, since simply adjusting the representation on an officer's certificate gives the agent a defense to issuance on the face of the certificate. [An amendment is preferable from Enron's perspective.] [Note that as we previously discussed, there is not an event of default under the facilities, since that provision has a materiality qualifier.]

"Annex V","Mark nothing has changed since our meeting last week, but here's a quick summary for your convenience:

 1. Deliberation 15: COMAE (board for ASMAE, which acts as the clearinghouse for the MAE) issued Deliberation 15 directing ASMAE to do its accounting without applying Annex V by Oct. 31, 2001.  The generators object because without Annex V,  they are 20% short instead 5% short.  Elektro and the LDCs object because failure to apply Annex V ignores the contract which is registered with the MAE, and a 20% long position will never be upheld.  Deliberation 15 further directs ASMAE to gather and supply to the generators and LDCs the information for application of Annex V, seven days prior to Oct 31.  This is good because it gives Elektro the information it needs to calculate the set off against the generators for its 5% long position.  Thus, it is unnecessary for Elektro to seek an injunction against ASMAE compelling the information.  

2. Letter to COMAE/ASMAE:  To preserve its position, Elektro sent a letter objecting to the COMAE's failure to direct ASMAE to apply Annex V.  The letter confirms a list of information LDCs require for the calculation.  If the information is not provided or is delayed, Elektro will go to court to compel the information.  Once it gets the information, Elektro can go to court  to force ASMAE to apply Annex V.  Prior to taking the set off, Elektro will seek an injunction to protect its assets from seizure by the generators under Annex VI. Subsequently, Elektro will file a suit against the generators to enforce the contractual application of Annex V.

3.  Two suits are being filed immediately to compel ANEEL to permit Elektro to recover or pass through various costs increases pursuant to its concession agreement.

   Michelle

I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else. Dave Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement.

"ESA government negotiations/ corrected","Disegard previous e-mail.
We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:  

     1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$163 million or US$ 63 million. Corrected numbers in second email

       2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million. 

       3.  Parcel  ""A"" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_401773040>Hundreds of business and investing books have crossed my desk this year. Below is a list of my favorites. Of these, Jim Collins's Good to Great <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_41> is my pick for best business book of the year. The work is the result of five years of research into companies that have delivered extraordinary long-term results. You'll be surprised at not only the companies Collins tags as great, but at the approach they took to achieve their results.

by Christopher Locke 
Count on Chris Locke to poke holes in the conventional thinking that determines how companies relate to their markets. In Gonzo Marketing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_58>, Locke takes on the mass-market mindset that defines most big companies and prescribes a new and ""dangerous"" way for businesses to interact with customers. Smart and provocative, this book belongs on the shelf of any businessperson looking for a fresh point of view.

The Myth of Excellence: Why Great Companies Never Try to Be the Best at Everything <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608207/ref=mk_del_235668_64>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Fred Crawford, Ryan Mathews 
The first thing Fred Crawford and Ryan Mathews asked themselves after surveying 5,000 consumers was how their survey respondents could be so wrong. Their results so upset the conventional thinking about consumer marketing that the two began to reevaluate their assumptions about what American consumers really want--and the results will probably surprise you as well. In The Myth of Excellence, Crawford and Mathews show why ""values"" are taking center stage in today's marketplace.

by Nancy F. Koehn 
In Brand New, Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn looks at six extraordinary brands and the entrepreneurs that built them, from Josiah Wedgwood and Henry Heinz to Howard Schultz and Michael Dell. What interests Koehn is not so much the success these brands enjoyed as much as the trust these household names were able to inspire in consumers. Part business history, part marketing manual, Brand New is a revealing study of brand development that belongs on every thoughtful marketer's bookshelf.

"FW: Debt Funding to Enron Corp.","Peter,

Be assured that I am extremely sensitive to the issues affecting board members in Canada.  We also have similar issues in the UK.  We will endeavor to communicate as best we can.  However, all behavior with respect to your concerns must be practical in light of Enron's cash management systems.  We cannot always hold a board of directors meeting in order to effect a wire transfer.  I am choosing not to interpret your memo as some sort of threat, but as an effort to highlight a reasonable concern.

Regards,

Ray Bowen

"Electricity Risk Management Workshop and Conference and Other Upcoming Events","Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference

December 5-7, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.

 

EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.

 

The website links for the Workshop and Conference are provided below:

Performance-Based Ratemaking: Theory and Applications Workshop, Dec. 5, 2001, Denver, CO

<http://www.euci.com/wrkshpoverview.asp?ConfID=9&WrkshpID=4>

Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference, Dec. 6-7, 2001, Denver, CO

<http://www.euci.com/confoverview.asp?ConfID=9>

 

Electric Power Market Performance Conference

December 12-14, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.

 

A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.

 

Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

 Electric Risk Management 101 Workshop 

And

Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference

January 22-25, 2001, New York City, NY

OVERVIEW

 

In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

 

The website links for these events are provided below:

Electricity Risk Management 101 Workshop, Jan. 22-23, 2002, New York City, NY

<http://www.euci.com/wrkshpoverview.asp?ConfID=13&WrkshpID=8>

Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference, Jan. 24-25, 2002, New York City, NY

<http://www.euci.com/confoverview.asp?ConfID=13>

 

We have updated our website to include new conference proceedings on recently-held ""Power Generation Asset Management"" and ""Power T&D Asset Management"" conferences. Please visit www.euci.com <http://www.euci.com/> and review the conference proceedings section.

Kindly forward this announcement to your colleagues who might benefit from attending these events.

"RE: Potts Opinion","Not unexpectedly this seems to me consistent with our thinking so far..

I am with Diane - I think ISDA can serve a valuable function by coming out with a statement saying that a) we have canvassed many dealers in the market and the prevailing opinion is that the
particular Railtrack Convertible is deliverable b) we do not see it as ISDA's place to make binding interpretations on the market, but our own interpretation is consistent with this view and c) attach
the Potts QC Opinion (if we are permitted to do so) 

But we shouldn't play this up as another ""issue"" for the Credit Derivative market beyond what it is. And as more of these types of matters arise we should consider what criteria dictate our
involvement

Moody's Downgrades Mariner Energy's Sub Notes To Caa2


Dow Jones & Company, Inc. -- December  3, 2001


     Following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service:

    New York, December 03, 2001 -- Moody's Investor's Service downgraded to
Caa2
from B3 the rating on Mariner Energy Inc.'s (Mariner) $100 million 10.5%
senior
subordinated notes due 2006. Moody's also downgraded Mariner's senior
implied
rating to B3 from B1 and its unsecured issuer rating to Caa1 from B2.
Moody's
does not rate the company's $150 million senior secured credit facility
maturing
October 2002.

    The ratings outlook is negative, reflecting uncertainty regarding the
effect
of Enron's bankruptcy on Mariner.

    The ratings downgrades reflect the absence of potential support from
Enron
going forward. Mariner's ratings had incorporated continuing implied support
from Enron while Mariner grew its size relative to the scale of its business
risks and capital requirements. Enron indirectly owns 96% of the firm
through
Joint Energy Development Investments LP (JEDI), and indirectly contributed
about
$130 million in equity during 1998-2000. Mariner's credit facility and
subordinated notes are non-recourse to Enron and do not cross-default with
Enron
obligations.

    Through 9/30/01, Mariner sold 38% of its oil and gas production to Enron
under
one to three month production contracts. Receivables from these sales were
$2.7
million at 9/30/01. Mariner also has commodity price hedges with Enron
through
2003. The value of these contracts was approximately $28 million at 9/30/01.
A
portion of these contracts was settled subsequent to 9/30/01, and commodity
prices have improved slightly since 9/30/01, causing the value of these
contracts to decline.

    Mariner's ratings assume that the company operates as an entity
independent
from Enron. The ratings reflect a small, concentrated and comparatively
short-
lived reserve base; the company's exploration focus on deepwater plays in
the
Gulf of Mexico (GOM), which have relatively large up front costs; high
leverage
on the reserve base; and relatively high full cycle unit costs.

    The scale of the front-end exploration and development costs associated
with
Mariner's operations is large relative to Mariner's size, and there are
significant time lags prior to commencement of production. Mariner's proved
reserves totaled 34 mmboe as of 12/31/00, with PD reserves at only 16 mmboe.
The
large PUD component, representing over 50% of proved reserves, requires
significant capex to bring to production, and the reserve life is short, at
about 5 years (less than 3 years on PD reserves).

    Mariner's deep water oriented business strategy and limited scale result
in a
concentrated reserve base, with the company's top nine properties
representing
93% of 12/31/00 reserves. Overall production and reserve movements can be
lumpy
and susceptible to delay and operational risks at an individual property,
while
the short life of the reserve base compounds the challenge of growing
reserve
mass and sustaining production levels. Mariner expects to diversify its
reserve
base over time by increasing activity in the shelf/shallow GOM, but over the
near term the reserve base is expected to remain relatively small,
concentrated,
and comparatively short-lived.

    Mariner's debt on proved developed (PD) reserves has declined from over
$10/
boe in early 2000, but remains high, at about $6.30/PD boe and is not
expected
to decrease significantly over the near term. Continuing heavy capex
requirements are expected to require revolver drawings in 2002, and if Enron
fails to make payments under Mariner's commodity hedges, additional drawings
may
be required to make up for the lost cash flow. Currently, Mariner's
revolving
credit ($65 million borrowing base, after the November 2001 sale of
Aconcagua)
is undrawn and proceeds from the sale of Aconcagua provide near term
liquidity
for 4Q01 capex. The revolver expires in October 2002, and Mariner expects to
extend it in early 2002.

    Mariner's production has been decreasing in 2001 (from 19 mmboe/d in
1Q01 to
16 mmboe/d in 3Q01). However, Mariner expects to start production at King
Kong
and Yosemite by the end of 2001, which would add to 12/31/01 PD reserves and
support production growth during 2002.

    Mariner's full cycle leveraged unit cost structure is relatively high.
At
average unhedged realizations of $22.20 in 3Q01, Mariner's leveraged unit
margin
(including about $1.85/boe of interest expense) would have been slightly
below
average historic unit reserve replacement costs. In a sustained period of
weak
commodity prices, the company's liquidity may become strained, given its
heavy,
front-ended capex and the short life of its reserve base.

    Mariner Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration and development
company, with headquarters in Houston, Texas, and principal operations in
the
Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast area.

"Brazil Update","CUIABA
Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA.   As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a ""put"" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks.  These issues must also be resolved for financing.  

GT11/12:  Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end.  Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures.  Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem.

Shell:  Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.

ANNEX V

After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V.

Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off.  I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm.  If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it.  

I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations.

Regards,
   Michelle

FERC Enacts Major Constraints 
on Wholesale Market



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis








AEP, Entergy Corp. and Southern Company told by FERC to charge cost-based prices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions. 

[News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a condition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade power in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would improve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test based on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in serving peak electricity loads. ""If you're big enough to control the market at the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you,"" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood. 

Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tremendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state regulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates, which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrinking profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this ruling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experienced in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can also be seen as another example of the ""big stick"" that the commission is using to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizations (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairman Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale markets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represents a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prompt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading. 

Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charge unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. Instead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Southern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) have been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately applying its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power separate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined that these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power ""test,"" a generator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electricity is ""pivotal"" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a price above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a dramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's main criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power needed in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal level. 

There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not eliminated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where the grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is significant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there are secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current ruling only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not impacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term contracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not included in the new ruling. 

The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposals to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charge for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered by an independent third party. 

The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique known as ""split the savings."" The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies identified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot power into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers who want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not producing or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions will be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decremental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transaction price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, sellers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous day and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potentially creates is an ""information advantage"" for buyers who have six hours to evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of the drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows the purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original incremental bid and competing around the seller's price. 

Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means is that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes they exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has occurred. 

I made a previous reference to the ""big stick"" that FERC is carrying related to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood had threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger applications, advantages that the chairman equated with the ""new world"" of the deregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Company, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be subsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhibited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding national RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three utilities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Southern Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading and previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets over the next five years. 

Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single dissenting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evaluate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contested, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued statements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which the ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for possible litigation. 

Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a handful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illustrates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this could be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to other wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time. Third, the ""split the savings"" cost-based formula could become fraught with its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market over power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in the bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruling is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impacts AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deemed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have also not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three companies are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked that the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now will gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could substantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted.

"Draft of revised definition of Material Adverse Change/Credit Rating Trigger","Pursuant to our discussion yesterday regarding the above, please find below for your consideration a suggested revision to MAC/Credit Rating trigger definition to used in all future master trading agreements or confirmations in which Enron Corp's credit rating is part of a MAC/Credit Rating trigger.

""Material Adverse Change"" means (i) with respect to [Enron Trading Entity], Enron Corp. (or its successor or its successor's parent company) shall have long-term, senior, unsecured debt not supported by third party credit enhancement that is rated by S&P below ""BBB-"" [also insert Moody's as appropriate];

I understood yesterday that we may also need to consider changing the definition of Credit Support Provider in the ISDA's. I suspect that if ""Credit Support Provider"" is defined as Enron Corp. in the relevant Master, then the corresponding changes noted above would also need to be made. Your further thoughts regarding this issue are welcomed.

Please provide me your comments to the above language by tomorrow so we can start implementing a revised definition in our agreement templates.

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office.

"FW: ENRON EUROPE","
Mark,

I'd be grateful if we could have a short conversation today at a convenient time to suit you to discuss:

1. The West LB LC facility. Corp still has not formed a view on whether we can give the ""no material litigation"" rep. so we cannot revert to West LB. Apart from the ?55m potentially available from WLB, Enron Europe now have NO LC facilities available. This is hurting us. Even if the answer is negative, at least we could give WLB a clear answer and negotiate to draw down on the facility.

2. Wrongful trading comfort. The directors having taken independent advice and been told that some fairly low level comfort is needed from Houston, noise and nervousness is now growing at this end because it has not been forthcoming. I attach a draft which would suffice.

 
Can we please talk about how we can get Jeff McMahon to send this to Michael Brown.

3.ICI Counterindemnities and TXU: I discussed these with Jeff Hodge yesterday. Do you need anything more from me on these?   

Thanks


							Mark

Subject:	ENRON EUROPE


Mark, Rob

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4. 

Many thanks.



								Mark

"Material Contract Review","For Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Canada Power Corp., the following is a summary of change in control provisions:

1.  Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Gas Agreement - there is no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)
2.  Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Gas Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)
3.  Current Precedent Form of Master Firm Physical Power Agreement - although there is no change in control provision, there is an ""Event of Default"" where a party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) into another entity and, at the time of such reorganization, the resulting entity fails to assume all the obligations of the predecessor party under that agreement (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)
4.  Current Precedent Form of Guarantee supporting the Power Master - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)
5.  Physical GTCs (Gas and Power) - no change in control provision (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)
6.  ISDA - there is an ""Event of Default"" where one party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) and the resulting entity does not assume the obligations of the preceding entity under the ISDA.  There is also a ""Credit Event upon Merger"" when one party or its Credit Support Provider reorganizes and the creditworthiness of the resulting entity is ""materially weaker"" than the predecessor entity.  A Credit Event upon Merger allows the non-affected party to terminate. (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)
7.  Financial Omnibus - in the financial terms and conditions (Annex A) there is an ""Event of Default"" where a party reorganizes (including by asset transfer) into another entity and, at the time of such reorganization, either the resulting entity fails to assume all of the obligations of the Defaulting Party under the Confirmation or  the resulting entity's creditworthiness is materially weaker than that of the Defaulting Party (mirroring the ISDA ""Merger without Assumption"" and ""Credit Event upon Merger""). (individual contracts would ahve to be checked)
8.  Impact Energy Subscription Agreement - no change in control provisions
9.  Petro Canada Services Agreement - Section 11.4 indicates that Enron Canada ceasing to be an affiliate of Enron North America Corp. is a material breach of the agreement entitling PC to terminate the agreement in accordance with its terms.
10.  Suncor Services Agreement - Article 18 allows for the termination of the agreement by Suncor if (i) there is a change in shareholding of either ECC or ENA that results in either or both ceasing to be an affiliate of Enron Corp. or (ii) ECC or ENA disposes of all or substantially all of its or their assets or (iii) ECC, ENA or Enron Corp. amalgamate, merge or consolidate into another entity other than an affiliate and such transaction would have a material adverse impact on the business on Suncor.
11.  Sundance B Power Purchase Arangement - no change in control provision
12.  British Energy Power Purchase Agreement - no change in control provision
13.  OEFC Services Agreement - no change in control provision 
14.  ENERconnect Services Agreement - no change in control provision 
15.  SYNCRUDE Services Agreement - no change in control provision
16.  CASCO Services Agreement - no change in control provision
17.  Papier Masson Agreements - these were all transferred to Houston and should be checked by someone in EIM

As far as trading agreements go, I believe that most if not all inter-company contracts (ie. between ECC and Enron Direct, ENA, EES, etc.) have a MAC clause relating to ownership by Enron Corp. but I am not aware of any third party trading agreements that would contain the same provision with respect to Enron Canada.

"Restructuring (Confidential Communications)","At the right time, it would be helpful to discuss what we may want to consider as ""Core"" Assets (unrelated to trading activities) for purposes of emerging from bankruptcy as a going concern.  As you know, we are in the process of organizing and formatting in an asset matrix the assets/businesses we currently own (or otherwise have an interest in) that may be potentially for sale; separating out potential core assets will be instructive as part of this process.

Please let me know your thoughts/suggestions over the next few weeks.

Dear Lakeisha,

Spain's Endesa Moves In for a U.S. Acquisition 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News report from Power Finance & Risk] Endesa, Spain's largest utility, is setting up a business development unit in New York and will shortly transfer three executives from its Madrid headquarters to seek out investment opportunities in the United States. Virginia Sanz de Madrid, a Spanish utility analyst at Deutsche Bank in Madrid, says Endesa is probably looking to acquire existing generation or distribution companies rather than develop new assets from scratch. She adds that Endesa is looking to spend some $2 to $3 billion to enter the U.S. energy market. 

Analysis: A common response to reports that Endesa is attempting to expand in the United States may be: Why has the company waited so long? Along with affording new opportunities for domestic companies, deregulation of the U.S. electric market has also enticed several large European power firms to expand their scales through a stateside acquisition. Thus, some financial analysts may wonder if Endesa is jumping on the U.S.-expansion bandwagon too late. The timing may still be right for Endesa, however, considering that falling wholesale electricity prices across the United States and the decreased value of generation assets over the last few months could actually make a U.S. generation purchase more lucrative today than in recent years. Consequently, Endesa's rumored expansion efforts in the United States, and continuing acquisitions across continental Europe, are part of the company's aggressive growth strategy. 

Under the monopoly system in Spain, Endesa was clearly the country's largest power firm, owning about 22,576 MW of generating capacity and controlling 67 percent of Spain's electricity market. However, due to its own move toward privatization, the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the domestic growth of the country's largest electric companies, requiring Endesa to look abroad for growth opportunities. Thus, for some time there has been little question that Endesa would like to develop interests across continental Europe, and is not going to let any dust settle before it continues to expand. The fact that Endesa also plans to expand in the United States represents a new, but not necessarily surprising, direction for the company. 

The impetus for Endesa moving into the United States, beyond the opportunities for growth that exist in this country, may be rooted in some setbacks that Endesa has experienced in Spain and minimal acquisition opportunities across continental Europe. In late 2000, Endesa made its first significant move outside of Spain when it purchased a 30-percent interest in the French electricity generator Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Thermique (SNET). While a comparatively small company by American standards, SNET is the second-largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity, and third largest in terms of electricity generation. SNET owns five coal plants totaling 2,600 megawatts, which generate about 6,838 GWh annually. This is a very low output, and in fact SNET accounts for only 2.5 percent of the market share in France. However, given the fact that France's largest energy company, EDF, still has a hold on about 90 percent of the market in the country, the acquisition of the next-largest company was a major coup. The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the company's experience in coal-based electricity-which still is the power source for roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent-and its progressiveness in terms of technology. 

Upon the acquisition of SNET, Endesa began friendly merger proceedings with Iberdrola, the second-largest power firm in Spain. Under the now-terminated deal, Endesa would have purchased Iberdrola for about $12.6 billion and created a new entity well prepared to expand across Europe and Latin America. Reportedly, the merger would have created the world's third-biggest electricity company, after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron, and without question would have marked Spain's largest industrial merger to date. For further perspective, the new company created by the merger between Endesa and Iberdrola would have had a combined market capitalization of approximately 36 billion euros (or $32 billion in U.S. terms). This would have surpassed Duke Energy's market capitalization of $30.3 billion and been roughly the size of American Electric Power, TXU, and Reliant put together (resulting in a $33.8 million market capitalization). Had it materialized, the merger also would have given a considerable jolt to Spain's fast-growing power market, and altered the current playing field among Europe's largest power companies. 

However, in a major setback for Endesa's growth, Spanish authorities required that the merged company sell off some generating capacity, arguing that Spain needed new players to increase competition. The government also ruled that the new entity would have to lower its market share of distribution, and authorities cut the amount of stranded costs that the new company would be able to recoup. Although analysts had expected the merger to proceed despite the government conditions, Endesa and Iberdrola said the imposed governmental conditions outweighed the benefits of the merger, which would create fewer synergies than initially proposed. Ironically, much of the funding for Endesa's purchases have come from the sales of its own non-strategic assets that took place in preparation for the Iberdrola acquisition. 

Moreover, the inability to grow its scale through the purchase of Iberdrola has apparently prompted Endesa to concentrate on finding new acquisition opportunities. In addition to expansion into the United States, last month Endesa led a consortium that will acquire the generation assets of Enel, Italy's largest generating company, for 2.63 billion euros. The generating assets, which are housed under a subsidiary company known as Elettrogen, include an installed capacity of 5,700 MW that is ranked as the second-largest generating firm in Italy. Elettrogen is one of three companies in which Enel grouped its generation assets in order to comply with Italian regulatory mandates regarding divestiture. The purchase of Elettrogen marks the first significant expansion of Endesa beyond its home territory in Spain. In the purchase agreement, Endesa will have 45-percent ownership of Elettrogen, partnering with Banco Santander Central Hispano (40 percent), a Spanish bank, and Italian ASM Brescia (15 percent), a municipal utility that serves 400,000 customers in Italy. 

The acquisition of Elettrogen is an important component of Endesa's expansion strategy across Europe and may be an indication of how the company intends to progress in the United States. Endesa has established a goal of accumulating 8,000 MW of generating capacity beyond its existing assets in Spain by 2005. Through the purchase of Elettrogen and the previous purchase of SNET, Endesa has already reached that goal four years ahead of schedule. 

If Endesa does make a purchase of a U.S. company, it will most likely be an acquisition that involves substantial generating assets, as power generation has become Endesa's primary focus. To date, there have been a handful of instances in which an international power firm has bought a U.S. energy company since deregulation began four years ago. ScottishPower purchased PacifiCorp, National Grid purchased New England Electric System (NEES) and Eastern Utilities Associates (EUA), and Powergen bought LG&E. Note that all of these buying companies are based in the United Kingdom. Pending international deals include National Grid's purchase of Niagara Mohawk and the German company RWE's purchase of American Water Works, and EDF has made it clear that it also wants to expand in the United States. Generally speaking, international power firms have used the purchase of either vertically integrated utilities or unbundled businesses as a ""testing ground"" to learn the ins and outs of the U.S. energy market and plan subsequent specialization in a particular market niche. Further, although international companies such as National Grid are focused on the transmission side of the U.S. energy industry, the generation sector clearly offers solid opportunities for growth. In the spring of 2001, President Bush released an energy plan that calls for significant new energy production efforts, which opened up new windows of opportunity for international companies to further expand in the United States.

"Prepay Transactions:  Physical and Swaps","
To my knowledge there are a variety of prepay forms of transactions.  
1.  Some older forms were physically based (I think primarily with respect to gas and with Chase).  Teresa Bushman and/or Dan Lyons worked on these transactions).  
2.  Newer forms are triangulated swaps.  There are a series with Citibank, related to credit link notes (see Gareth Bahlmann re link notes), known as Yosemite/Delta Transactions.  There are 4 in the series (4th series had three prepays, US, Sterling and Euro).  The 5th did not close.  
3.  There is at least one other with Citibank, dated June 2001 and it is being wrapped into the pipeline credit facility and will be extinguished via the placement of the pipeline facility.  
4.  I am aware of one other (via the London office) which was extended September 2001, among Credit Suisse First Boston and ENA and Barclays.  

I suggest you contact Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Dan Boyle to determine a complete list.  I believe that this detail may have been determined by one of the teams formed last week.  You may wish to check with Haedicke.
In respect of accounting treatment, and book treatment, I suggest the following names:  Alan Quaintance, Clint Walden re accounting.  Dan Boyle has a name of someone who worked on placing the Delta transactions in the risk books, but I cannot remember the name.

"Fax-2-Email Temporary Service Interruption","
November 16, 2001

Dear Enron Users:

Due to a severe storm which hit central Texas last evening
CYNET is experiencing a temporary service interruption
of the assigned telephone numbers of it's Inbound Fax-2-Email
Service.

Our local loop carrier has advised us they are aware of the situation 
and they are working to restore this connectivity. 

While CYNET maintains back-up facilities for its Fax-2-Email services
the problem we are faced with is that we can not place the same user
telephone number within two different facilities at the same time. Our
technical team is working on future recommendations in the form of
having individual back-up numbers in the event of this type of outage.

We sincerely do apologize for any inconvenience this may
cause you and your users and expect to have this service restored
as soon as possible. 

Sincerely,

Robert P. Demyanovich

"Viral Genetics:VRAL Achieves unprecedented AIDS breakthrough!","VIRAL GENETICS, INC.

	December, 2001
HIGHLIGHTS

*	Viral Genetics has developed a revolutionary new technology called TNP which, based 
on clinical results to date, not only 
stops but also reverses the progression of HIV infection in people.
*	TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear protein which, when 
purified and modified, greatly 
stimulates the body's immune response system.
*	Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 terminally ill AIDS 
patients in clinical trials show virtually no 
sign of HIV infection.
*	TNP treated patients display virtually no side effects to treatment.
*	TNP technology is patented in 16 countries and patent pending in Canada and the U.S.
*	Treatments are far less costly and less cumbersome than currently employed 
alternatives.

OVERVIEW

Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize therapeutic and 
diagnostic systems for the treatment of 
viral diseases.  Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop and 
reverse the progression of HIV 
infection in humans.  After expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their 
core technology - TNP (Thymus 
Nuclear Protein).

Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal studies and three 
human clinical trials.  Each human trial 
consisted of 10 to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by intra-
muscular injection bi-weekly over 
an eight week period.  Follow up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 
667 days after treatment.  The trials 
revealed the following incredible results with respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:

-	HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after treatment.
-	Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which completely subsided 
after treatment and remained that way 
even 18 months after treatment.
-	Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no Antiviral Drug 
Cocktail has shown any efficacy with 
whatsoever.
-	Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP treatment.

Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide governments to commercialize 
the TNP technology.

"RE:","David

At present we have we do not use them and have put a hold on anyone using them.

We talked to them but they refused to sign a non solicitation clause. 

Their principle in the Houston office is a guy called Lyndon Taylor - former Enron employee.

He called me today and has agreed to sign our non-solicitation clause - I think this is the preferrable strategy as Lyndon is well connected as a former Enron employee and this will take them out for 12 months. 

Given that he is prepared to sign up to this now means he may have not had any success in calling in.

I understand you may get a call from Steve Kean about these Q and As.  I've sent copies to Tim Detmering (to get comments on the business side) and to Lance, Scott Wulfe, Joe Dilg, Shelley Barber and John Ale on the legal side (and several others).  I've also asked VE to prepare something for us to send to our employees that addresses what we can and can't say or do in terms of sharing information with Rockne (from an anti-trust and confidentiality standpoint).  It would be great if Richard Sanders or Bob Williams could help on this.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

   Subject:    Bank of England Application
   
   Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we
   received an
   application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When
   we have
   considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the
   past,
   consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's
   derivatives
   activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are
   likely
   to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have
   generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium,
   Denmark
   and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We
   have even
   admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In
   general, we
   let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of
   ISDA
   materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that
   there
   may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.
    
   In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been
   expressed
   if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank
   of
   England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for
   membership.
   These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in
   the
   regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better
   positioned to
   influence the process.
    
   Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank
   of
   England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services
   Authority has
   correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the
   traditional
   central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the
   market
   and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to
   the FSA. 
    
   In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns
   previously
   expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views
   on the
   application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from
   the Hong
   Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not
   received
   an application.
    
   Please share your views with the other members of the Board.
    
   Bob

"EGEP & EOGIL Cash Needs","Mark,  Thanks for your voice mails yesterday regarding the cash needs of our two organizations, EGEP and EOGIL.  Based on your messages I am a little confused and if I need to talk with someone else to actually move cash to EGEP and or EOGIL in the near-term I need to know the process to follow and whom to talk with.  Here is a synopsis of our situation.

The cash generating company that EGEP manages is EOGIL (our Indian E&P sub).  EOGIL generates about $5 to 6 Million dollars of before tax free cash flow each month (depending on oil prices and variable operating expenses) that is deposited into a New York EOGIL account and immediately swept to an Enron Corp. account (currently EDF).  Therefore, this sub is self sufficient and should be able to handle all planned 2002 extra-ordinary capital or operating expenses.  The only near-term issue is our estimated tax payment that is due 12-15-01 of 6.4 MM$ for the 4th quarter of 2001.   Since all of our money is immediately swept to EDF, we do not have these funds on hand and we will not receive enough cash prior to the 15th to make this payment.  Therefore, if we want to be self sufficient, a) we need to retain any new funds in our EOGIL account and, b) any deficit can be borrowed from EGEP (assuming it is funded as described below) and repaid to EGEP from 2002 cashflows.

EGEP is the Houston based technical arm and management for EOGIL.  We have 40 people that work directly on the EOGIL assets (we had over 100 people last year and have cut staff to current levels as we sold assets) and these people are currently pledged to British Gas for a 60 day transition period if and when we close the sale of EOGIL to BG.  All of these people will be severed after the transition period and they all know this is their fate (they have known this since October 2000).  The reason they are still here is for two reasons; 1) Divestiture agreements and 2) Severance payments.  If we can not guarantee pay-roll, severance and divestiture we will lose people immediately.  Most of the staff can walk to EOGR at any time and without some comfort regarding severance and divestiture, I know they will leave which puts us in jeopardy for a) maintaining our operations and operatorship, b) being able to fulfill our contractual commitment to BG, or c) losing the talent necessary to re-market if we can't close the BG deal.  

Operatorship is a very valuable commodity and retaining it for re-sale is worth $50-75 million even if we elect to sell to an Indian company.  In order to retain operatorship it is vital that we retain the current staff.

I realize this may seem trivial in the larger scope of things, but in light of the reasons we are looking into this matter of keeping our cash generating subs operational, having money for these items will be essential.  EGEP's monthly G&A is approximately 1.8 MM$ per month.  Enron's obligations to the employees in the form of severance and divestiture is approximately $10 million.  Therefore, I would recommend that we deposit $15mm into the EGEP account to cover known commitments and we will bill future months of EGEP G&A either to EOGIL or BG, whichever is appropriate.  Furthermore, EOGIL can use the $15 million to draw against if we need any near-term funding before we build any cash reserves.

I hope this helps clarify our situation.  I am available to discuss this issue at your convenience and can be reached at 3-5934 or my cell 713-569-4713.  Let me know if I need to talk to others in the organization.

Thanks
jeff

attach a Bloomberg release on the issue. It is interesting that the ISMA study
is no longer available on ISMA web site. Also, I don't see in today's news any
trace of the press conference announced in the ISMA press release.

California Develops Plan 
to Renegotiate Long-Term 
Power Contracts as State 
Faces Energy Surplus 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis





[News item from the Los Angeles Times] After months of defending the $43 billion worth of long-term electricity contracts he helped negotiate on behalf of the state, S. David Freeman suggested for the first time this week that the contracts be renegotiated, perhaps through the California Power and Conservation Financing Authority, a new public power agency he now chairs. ""There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be renegotiated,"" said Freeman, noting that critics of the contracts include Gov. Gray Davis, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission and the leader of the State Senate. Freeman said he is still proud of his work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as gougers and pirates, but California's energy picture has vastly changed since January. 

Analysis: Oh, yeah, the California energy crisis ? remember that? For some, it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill-fated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating consequences, especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headlines in the energy industry. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that, even though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat, some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis continue to plague the state. As one of the main resolution steps that were taken to repair the dysfunctional market, the state of California stepped into a very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the state's three IOUs (Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.), which due to credit problems were unable to secure power on their own. In an ironic twist indicating that California's problems are far from over, the stabilization of the state's markets are now in essence causing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be questionable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis. 

At issue presently are some 54 long-term contracts that the state of California, through its Department of Water Resources, signed with power generators such as Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke (NYSE: DUK), Mirant (NYSE: MIR), and Williams (NYSE: WMB) to name a few back in early 2001, a time at which wholesale power prices were still running at very high levels. One of the primary benefits of the contracts was that they reduced the state's reliance on the volatile spot market, where prices had soared as high as $500/MWh. As a whole the contracts are worth about $43 billion and have a lifespan of 10 years or more. Some might argue that Gov. Davis, who led the effort for the state to assume the role of power purchaser, felt pressure to sign the contracts at that time, due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solvency of Pacific Gas & Electric and SCE in particular. However, critics argue that the contracts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices were the highest. 

Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary, but there are some interesting details that can be gleaned. First, a good number of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times, including those of low demand (such as the morning). This leaves the state with a surplus of power that it does not need, which it in turn has been forced to sell at a loss. We also know that, as a general observation, the state bought power under the long-term contracts at an average price of $75/MWh. That same power reportedly will sell for only $16/MWh in 2002. 

As noted, Freeman, who previously managed the municipal utility known as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently assumed the management post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at the request of Gov. Davis. The agency was charged with quelling the extreme situation that California faced over the last year, including soaring power prices and blackouts. Looking beyond the immediate problems that have subsided, Freeman's new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contracts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time. 

Let me try to put Freeman's plan into a nutshell. As a state agency, the Power Authority could sell up to $4 billion in revenue bonds, which would be guaranteed by energy sales, to lease, build or buy power plants. Consequently, the state, which can borrow money at below-market rates, is in a position to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could. As a carrot to entice the renegotiation of the long-term contracts, the state could offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants in the state. In other words, the state would carry the investment for the costs of the new plants, alleviating pressure on the private companies to provide a 20-percent return to their shareholders. Note that most of the generating companies involved in long-term contracts with California are committed to building new power plants anyway. Some reports I've seen indicate that 70 percent of the 54 contracts that the state has signed include clauses that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the state. However, under normal circumstances, the expense of building the new plants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Thus, in return for the financial incentive, the same generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long-term contracts with the state of California, presumably based on current market conditions. Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the prices in the contracts, or providing the state with more flexibility on the timing and quantity of electricity that must be purchased. 

The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has some legs. Nevertheless, word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that California is presently suffering from an energy glut (unused electricity) that may end up costing ratepayers as much as $3.9 billion over the next decade. The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased conservation efforts, which brought demand down, a condition that was maintained by comparatively moderate weather trends. The end result is that the state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of the customers served by the three IOUs, and the state unfortunately cannot sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit. For instance, according to a report by the Department of Water Resources, in one three-month, low-usage period expected in the spring of 2002, 57 percent of the power for which the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to 80 cents on the dollar, ultimately costing utility customers as much as $193 million. The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will reach its peak in 2004 and then gradually decline through 2010. 

Consequently, despite the financial advantages of Freeman's plan, the logistics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the apparent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy. In addition, some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state already own a large amount of generation capacity in California and may not be easily convinced to build new plants right away. For instance, Calpine Corp., which is one of the companies that has signed a long-term deal with the state of California, responded to the plan as saying that it ""wouldn't be anything that Calpine would use."" The company reportedly has finished three new power plants since June 2001 and would not be enticed by the financing incentive that the state is orchestrating. Further, the state's desire to renegotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept. Ever since wholesale prices began to drop earlier this year, the renegotiation debate has been a fixture of state legislative and regulatory proceedings. However, since the onset of the talks, a good number of the generating companies have maintained that re-negotiation would not be possible as they had already locked themselves into deals with natural-gas suppliers. 

Thus, one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will discourage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources, at least in the near term, which could set the state up for another dangerous boom-and-bust cycle down the road. In addition, those companies that already have long-term contracts with the state (such as Calpine) may not be enticed by the financing incentive, and those companies that don't have long-term contracts with the state will have no incentive at all to build new plants in California. All of this could create a situation in which California has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in another shortage situation 10 or more years down the line. 

Freeman is apparently also pushing the state to once again make an attempt to take over some of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s physical assets. Instead of its transmission lines, however, the state now is examining its opportunity to buy the hydroelectric generation network (including dams and powerhouses) owned by the state's largest electric utility. Note that under its restructuring plan that has been submitted for regulatory approval, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. would split from its parent, PG&E Corp., and transfer generating and electric and gas transmission assets to form three new companies, which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). State regulators do not like this plan, and thus are seeking a way to retain control over the generating and transmission assets of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Putting the hydroelectric assets under the State Power Authority would keep the assets under state control. 

Moreover, even though California is rethinking certain choices it made almost a year ago that directly entrenched the state government in the energy market, state officials still seem to want to gain control over fundamental parts of the state's energy infrastructure. Remember that Gov. Davis spent much of the last year attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate deals with SCE and SDG&E for the purchase of the utilities' transmission networks. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. never was interested in selling its transmission assets, which it believed the state's offer grossly undervalued. One of the main reasons that these attempts by the governor were unsuccessful was concern by state legislators who argued that the state was ill equipped to assume operation of the complex transmission networks. Nevertheless, in addition to renegotiating the long-term contracts, the state is still pursuing at least the hydroelectric generation assets of Pacific Gas & Electric.

Subject:	Brazil Update

CUIABA
Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA.   As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a ""put"" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks.  These issues must also be resolved for financing.  

GT11/12:  Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end.  Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures.  Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem.

Shell:  Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.

ANNEX V

After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V.

Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off.  I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm.  If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it.  

I will stay in touch with Orlando this week to determine if and when we can file these suits without interfering with his negotiations.

Regards,
   Michelle

"Retail litigation","I gather that Bob will be spending most of his time on the securities litigation.  Is it still possible to get a litigation manager to  handle EES matters.  I would hope we could use one of the EWS litigators, as we discussed earlier.  Having someone on the floor would be a definite plus as well. I had talked to Andy but  never finalized because of the crisis situation we are in.  My main concern is that the EES business not be allocated among numerous litigators so that we do have accountability  or take a back seat to other assignments.  Thanks.

"Jeff Huff Resume","
	The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening.  The resume is attached below for your convenience.  

Below are a few points for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff

Munipalization Vote in San Francisco May Set Precedent



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from Associated Press] In the wake of this year's California power woes, votes in the hometown of the state's largest utility will decide on Nov. 6 whether to initiate action to seize Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s local electricity network and deliver power through a public agency. 

Analysis: There is a lot riding on today's vote, and its outcome will undoubtedly have significant ramifications for California and other cities across the country. Although the municipalization of an incumbent utility's electric system is not a new concept-either nationally or in this particular case-San Francisco is presently the largest city in which such efforts are being considered. Given the relative success of other municipalized electric systems in California (Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Sacramento Municipal Utility District, for instance), along with the bad publicity that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has encountered over the last year due to the state's energy crisis and its own bankruptcy proceedings, today's vote could very well be a victory for public power. The vote in and of itself will not create a municipalized electric system in San Francisco. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has already vowed to fight the takeover, and if the vote is a win for public power it will only lead to further lengthy and costly court battles. However, the vote is significant because it illustrates what appears to be a growing trend among cities that believe they can provide cheaper electric service than incumbent, for-profit utilities. In addition, the measure is just one more strike against the already beleaguered Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is still navigating through bankruptcy proceedings. 

There are two measures related to the public power movement that are up for vote in San Francisco today. First, Proposition I would create a San Francisco-Brisbane Municipal Utility District (MUD), an independent agency governed by a five-member board that would provide electric service to San Francisco and Brisbane, Calif., a smaller city located to the south of the Bay Area. California law requires that two separate cities be included in order for municipalization to take effect, and thus from the onset of the municipalization discussions in this area San Francisco and Brisbane were grouped together as one district. The second measure up for vote, known as Proposition F, would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and retain ties to City Hall. This measure would not create a MUD and therefore would not need to include Brisbane to take effect. The agency would be governed by an elected seven-member board of directors and would replace the current jurisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission. 

An affirmative vote in either or both of the measures would not necessarily mean an immediate effort to take over Pacific Gas & Electric's infrastructure. In addition to the court appeals that would undoubtedly take place, in the event of either measure being passed an elected board would have to subsequently vote whether or not to seize the utility's transmission and distribution lines. If such a vote were approved, the MUD could use eminent domain to take over the utility's assets. 

Ultimately at stake is a battle over Pacific Gas & Electric's 4.7 million customers and its transmission system, which has been appraised between $750 million and $1 billion (the utility claims that its system is worth $1.5 billion). Both sides have argued decidedly different platforms. The pro-muni effort in San Francisco / Brisbane has been led by Bruce Brugmann, the publisher of the Bay Guardian newspaper and City Supervisors Angela Alioto and Tom Ammiano. The proponents of the muni measure argue that a utility district operating as a nonprofit public entity would be more beneficial to city residents than a dividend-paying division of a major energy firm. It has been repeatedly noted by the pro-muni forces that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. charges the third-highest electric rates in the United States. In addition, the proponents point to already-established municipalized districts in California such as LADWP and SMUD, which they claim have protected customers from increasingly volatile prices for electricity. The other tenets of the pro-muni argument are that public power would lead to better accountability to customers and more emphasis on renewable energy. 

The movement against the muni effort is obviously led by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., but also includes officials from AT&T and Pacific Telesis Group, which together contributed about $250,000 to the opposition effort. Apparently, local communications companies fear that a successful municipalization effort of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. would lead to similar takeover measures in the phone industry. The basic argument against the public power movement is that the plan is unrealistic. Specifically, opponents say, the MUD formed by San Francisco and Brisbane would be ill-equipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & Electric has effectively managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be able to compete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD would have to purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also buy wholesale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which represent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run. It is true that the city of San Francisco owns the dam at Hetch Hetchy reservoir, which powers street lights and city offices with hydropower. However, the reservoir is reportedly in great need for maintenance and may require additional capital for upgrades. Thus, in order to serve Pacific Gas & Electric's 4.7 million customers, the MUD would have to buy most of its power on the wholesale market. 

This is actually one of several important points that may not have been taken into full consideration by the pro-muni forces. Already-established MUDs in California such as LADWP and SMUD, and those in other states, have already established lucrative contracts to obtain federal power at cheap rates through 2004. There is a good chance that a San Francisco / Brisbane MUD would not have the same opportunity to secure the same rates at this juncture. Thus, without the benefit of long-term contracts, the San Francisco / Brisbane MUD could be exposed to the volatile wholesale market or be forced to invest in the construction of expensive power plants. Often, such costs get overlooked when a city is planning to municipalize. In fact, it has been reported that the pro-muni side in this particular case did not conduct any feasibility study in advance of its campaign, and thus could very well be unaware of these associated costs. However, S. David Freeman, who previously managed LADWP and was recently appointed chairman of the new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, went on record stating that his organization could assist a public power agency in San Francisco by selling it low-cost electricity produced by plants financed by the authority. 

As noted, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. intends to fight the municipalization effort, and in fact has fought in City Hall and in court for decades to derail such efforts in San Francisco. However, in contrast with past battles, the issue has become more intensely politicized over the last year as San Franciscans faced rolling blackouts and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. went bankrupt. The utility recently received cash support from its parent PG&E Corp., which reportedly spent about $1 million in an advertising campaign urging citizens to vote against the public power initiative. This financial support has been helpful, considering that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is currently in bankruptcy proceedings and has little capital to front its own defense against the muni effort. Consequently, if voters pass the measures on Nov. 6, PG&E Corp. will undoubtedly launch a lengthy court battle that will keep the issue in litigation for years. In addition to the court appeals, it would most likely take the newly formed MUD years to gather the capital needed to front a purchase of Pacific Gas & Electric's T&D assets. 

Nevertheless, an affirmative vote on the muni issue could set a precedent for future votes and perhaps mark the dawn of a new era for public power. Other California cities such as San Diego, San Jose and Davis are closely following the outcome in San Francisco as they have also debated the issue of municipalization. In addition, the Coachella Valley Association of Governments, which includes the city of Palm Springs, Calif., began looking at the feasibility of taking over Southern California Edison's distribution system and forming a municipal utility last September. In fact, the municipalization effort has gained some momentum across the country over the last few years, along with the opening of competitive markets through deregulation. Current reports indicate that there are about 2,000 public electric districts, providing electric power to 40 million customers and accounting for 15 percent of the demand in the United States. It is important to note that the majority of these public power districts were formed in the early 1900s. 

The turnout for the vote in San Francisco could be a deciding factor. Although the issue had been gaining momentum in the city earlier this year, the events of Sept. 11 have turned the focus to more national events and made people wary of change. Typically, voter turnout in the area is around 35 percent. A recent survey conducted by the opponents of the measure found that 35 percent of those surveyed favored passage, 30 percent oppose it, and 35 percent were undecided. 

It is important to note that municipalization is not an issue that is only facing California. After several years of discussions, lawsuits and negotiations, the city of Hermiston, Ore., voted to spend $8 million to purchase the facilities PacifiCorp has been using to serve 4,000 commercial and residential customers. The city of Hermiston began serving customers on Oct. 1, when a new contract with Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) took effect. The federal power-marketing agency has already set aside 12 MW for the city, after determining that Hermiston qualified as a new small public utility eligible for preference power. 

Hermiston, Ore., is the first city to complete a contested municipalization of an incumbent utility's electric business in two decades (the last significant contested municipalization was completed in Massena, N.Y., in 1981). Despite the fact that a growing number of U.S. cities have expressed interest in municipalizing their electric systems, for the most part such efforts remain overwhelmingly unsuccessful when taken to court or a public ballot. Despite the success of Hermiston, some 50 other municipalization efforts have been terminated during the 30 years between 1970 and 2000. For instance, the city of Wichita, Kansas, spent more than $300,000 in the past two years studying municipal power options. However, after the Kansas Corporation Commission turned down Western Resources' proposed rate hike this summer, the city put municipalization plans on hold. Thus, the eyes of the industry will remain on the vote today in San Francisco for any indication that municipalization efforts are gaining momentum and proving successful. 

TOMORROW'S ISSUEALERT WILL INCLUDE THE OUTCOME OF THE MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE IN SAN FRANCISCO.

Dividend uncertainty enhances option pricing risk - Risk News

German power exchanges to merge
Financial Times - October 26, 2001
By Bettina Wassener 

Germany's two electricity exchanges, the European Energy Exchange and the
Leipzig Power Exchange, confirmed on Friday that they will merge by the
start of next year in a move that will pool liquidity in Europe's biggest
power trading market. 

The rival exchanges said on Friday the move was a ""merger of equals,"" though
existing shareholders in the Frankfurt-based EEX, whose owners include the
Eurex derivatives market, will hold 57.5 per cent of the merged exchange. 

Both exchanges were started fairly recently to capitalise on the boom in
power trading after liberalisation in the electricity sector since the late
1990s, but have faced competition from bilateral trades, and jointly
represent only 6.6 per cent of the market. 

The LPX, backed by power exchange Nord Pool, launched Germany's first spot
bourse in June last year, just ahead of a similar move by its
Frankfurt-based rival. The EEX began trading electricity futures earlier
this year. 

Due to the merger, the LPX will not now go ahead with plans to launch its
own futures contract which had been expected this year. The merged exchange
will offer a combination of the existing trading systems. 

The new exchange, to be called EEX but based in Leipzig, will be run jointly
by Hans Schweickhardt, EEX's chief executive, and Carlhans Uhle, his
counterpart at the LPX. About 90 participants from nine countries will trade
at the new EEX. 


Dividend uncertainty enhances option pricing risk
Risk News - October 24, 2001
By Sarfraz Thind

The growing spate of dividend cuts in the global markets has made dividends
a potential source of uncertainty in the pricing of equity derivatives.
Companies across the board now have reduced expectations of meeting their
earnings forecasts following the downturn in the economy, which, combined
with increasing use of share buybacks and return of capital as alternative
methods of cash distribution, has placed pressure on dividends, bankers said
Michael Maras, Merrill Lynch 

The latest analysis on European equity derivative markets by Merrill Lynch
forecasts a 2.52% decline in the dividend payments of FTSE 100 constituents
for 2001. Merrill's report said that market expectations for earnings and
dividend growth remain excessively optimistic. It added that earnings and
dividend forecasts across Europe are increasingly likely to see a downward
adjustment over the next six months, with dividend growth in the Euro Stoxx
50 index declining by around 2.5%. 

Michael Maras, global equity derivatives director at Merrill Lynch, told
RiskNews that the report was intended to warn investors of potential
dividend cuts, so that they re-evaluate their dividend yield ratios. Maras
pointed to companies such as the UK's Rolls Royce and Dutch bank ABN Amro
that have already had their dividend payment ability cast under doubt. He
identified the auto, technology and financial sectors as being especially
vulnerable. 

""A lot more trading houses will be reducing dividend expectations. This is a
global phenomenon, though it's a lot more intense in Europe, as [European]
companies have an over-reliance on dividends."" 

An equity derivatives trader at Morgan Stanley, who asked not to be named,
said that Merrill Lynch was ""absolutely right"". ""We are very, very cautious
about how we price options going through the dividend period.""

Guys, it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel (Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, Edith Cross, etc) into NETCO before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization.  It is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all EES retail risk contracts are valued and discharged (termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate.  After completion of this effort, these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate.  I would expect this to take the next four weeks.

Thanks

"Contract Settlement - Required Approvals","Lance -

It is my understanding that Enron Credit is currently closing down operations.  In light of this, EC has a contractual obligation to a company called Risk Metrics Group.  The obligation arises out of the development and hosting by RMG of a website devoted to the use of EC's credit risk data - the site being mainly focused toward subscribers to other RMG products.  Since we are terminating the development and hosting agreement - in essence shutting down the site - we will owe RMG approximately $96,000.

While I realize this is a small sum, I wanted to make sure (1) there are no approvals under the merger agreement that are required for a settlement of this nature and (2) if we are tracking this type of liability for merger purposes, that I provide the necessary information to the appropriate personnel.

Please let me know if either of the above are necessary.

Thanks.

"RE: Debt Funding to Enron Corp.","Ray, I am not sure how this reasonable and prudent request could in any way be interpreted as a threat, and therefore do not understand.  On the contrary, to sweep the accounts without the input of the Directors of these companies threatens the individuals with substantial personal liability. Further, to simply request the agreement of the three individuals who are the Directors of these companies is not onerous, and is consistent with their good faith attempts to discharge their fiduciary obligations as Directors.  Unfortunately, these fiduciary obligations do not recognize the administrative efficiencies of Enron's cash management systems.  If this remains unsatisfactory, please let me know by return.

Peter,

Be assured that I am extremely sensitive to the issues affecting board members in Canada.  We also have similar issues in the UK.  We will endeavor to communicate as best we can.  However, all behavior with respect to your concerns must be practical in light of Enron's cash management systems.  We cannot always hold a board of directors meeting in order to effect a wire transfer.  I am choosing not to interpret your memo as some sort of threat, but as an effort to highlight a reasonable concern.

Subject:	EES contracts

I wanted to bring you up to speed about some meetings we have been having regarding contract issues in the bankruptcy proceedings.

In connection with our asset sales, EES has been concerned about the deterioration in the value of the EES book as we receive notices from customers that they are terminating their contracts with us.  In general, our customers would not have the right to terminate EES contracts unless the contracts are considered forward contracts.  If the contracts are non forward executory contracts, the customer would have no right to terminate, and only EES as the debtor could effectively terminate by rejecting the contract.  

In any event, EES had been planning to write to the utilities where we had customer books that we are trying to sell, and state, in short, that the utility did not have the right to terminate our contracts with the utility because they were executory contracts, and that the utility did not have the right to process customer requests to switch  to other retail energy providers   because the customers did not have the right to terminate our contracts, since they were executory contracts. 

As we have discussed,  it is an open issue as to whether our contracts are forward or non-forward contracts.  The arguments that these contracts are not forward contracts would be based on the theory  that our customer is not a forward contract merchant, that retail contracts are much more than commodity contracts and include numerous other   services, and that the  contract can only be terminated by a forward contract merchant.  If we receive some offers to buy the retail books, claiming that our contracts are non-forward contracts would maximize the value of EES because the customers would be prevented from terminating their contracts and would not be switched to new  retail energy providers.  However, on a long term basis,  there may be advantages to any retail business on a go forward basis to consider these contracts forward contracts.  This would allow energy providers in the future to terminate upon customer bankruptcies.  

At the trading issues meeting  Janet, Mike and I attended yesterday, it was the strong view of the group that the best position for Enron in the bankruptcy process was that retail contracts were forward contracts, and that this position should be taken on an Enron wide basis.  I am assuming that we will want someone in a commercial role to confirm that this is the position EES is being asked to take for the benefit of the overall estate, and that we should not, in any letters we are writing to the utilities, describe our contracts as executory and subject to the automatic stay of the bankruptcy court.  I think we would go forward with other parts of the letter to the utilities that is not inconsistent with the overall positions.

Please let me know if you need more info.  Thanks.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

The lawsuit was filed at 11:06 a.m.  The next thing to do is to get MSN formally served.

We are trying to do that as quickly as possible  -- hopefully, by the end of the day.  Please do not mention the lawsuit to MSN until I notify you that formal service has been accomplished.

"EGM Contract Matrices","Julia:

The EGM group is delivering to you this afternoon completed matrices for all of our material physical trading contract forms and selected counterparty-specific contracts, in each case organized by commodity traded. 

Just a few things to note: (i) we have not included in our review the EGM trading contract forms for Japan, Australia and Singapore due to the time constraints (please advise if you would like matrices done for those offices); (ii) we have not included a review of trading contract forms used by EGM-related entities in Europe as we assumed that Justin Boyd's team (I left a message for Justin this morning, but I did not get a confirmation back) would handle; and (iii) finally, we are not attaching the templates to the matrices, but we can certainly provide them if and when needed.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mike,

thanks for the note. London lawyers already participate in a Houston legal trading forum at which these issues are being dealt with. I will check that there is no other forum on which Mark Haedicke needs our input.

There is also an ongoing effort in the UK, headed by Anna McAndrew and Richard Sage, contributed to on the legal front by Mark Elliott.

Mark,

Below are files regarding a presentation to the Management Committee on distressed debt and bankruptcy exposure.  In the middle of last (most recent) email it discusses a legal effort in Houston to better understand rights upon counterparty bankruptcy.

Do we want someone from London to be involved on the legal end?  I would imagine so since laws are quite diverse but I don't know the specific questions being asked.  Is there someone I can put in touch with Michael Tribolet and Mark Haedicke (or their assigns)?


Thanks

I wanted to follow up to your questions:

   Pasted below is the presentation for the Management Committee.   Rick Buy indicated there were no substantive comments.  The list is updated as new bankruptcies occur (which is almost daily).  I would imagine there will be enhancements to the format, but the one attached is what we are initially rolling out.   We are meeting every two weeks to review the list for missing fields.

I have a meeting tomorrow with Mark Haedicke to try to formalize our legal effort/team.   Currently, we tend to have some of the same originating attorneys involved.  Where we have had problems has been in the determination of termination rights upon bankruptcy.   It would make sense in Houston to have one (or two) Enron Corp attorneys that can quickly and regularly make this determination.   

We need to push the data collection responsibility into each business unit.   We would then take their reports and paste it into one company-wide sheet.     While Molly has drafted a cogent process, the implementation at the business unit level has been choppy thus far.   More to come.



Regards,


Michael


 




Mike,

Can I get a copy of whatever the final distressed workbooks / presentation looked like?  Thanks.

Also, do you have any plans going forward?  When is the next summary (special effort / reconciliation) required?  Do you have any changed formats or requirements since Buy's discussions with management?

Absent any changes you note we will continue to update and institutionalize (regular reporting system) information along the lines of that provided last week.

New Power Plant Planned
for New York City



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from Energy Info Source] New York state's siting board approved Astoria Energy's plans to build a 1,000-megawatt power plant in New York City, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January. Astoria Energy hopes to have the natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle plant that will be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service by 2004. The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site preparation before it can begin construction, and still must receive some local permits from New York City. Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC, a privately owned energy development company based in Concord, Mass. 

Analysis: The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply problems that have been identified within this region. Like California, New York also suffers from a supply / demand imbalance. However, even if or when power supply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take their own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, transmission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting board to proceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it should not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government. This could be easier said than done, as other planned power plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who ardently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant construction. 

The problems within the New York power market have been well documented. The state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since 1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven years since a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to open upstate. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the state's ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environmental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power. 

While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the problem appears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 report issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled ""Investigation of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region,"" highlighted specific capacity problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million people. These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmission lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York, but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily residential, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequently, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city. New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to increase by another 200 MW by summer 2002. 

Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of New York City and New York State. Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fast as new generation capacity was added. Demand over the course of 2001 was expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above regulators' earlier forecasts. 

It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Energy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energy-efficient and environmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. The company is a subsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy development company formed in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit will be a natural gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEd/New York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant reportedly will be $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary approvals on the local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003. Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air emissions. 

However, despite this optimism, the community opposition factor should not be discounted, and there are several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that Astoria Energy could face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, which hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year. Sithe Energies originally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facility fueled by natural gas in Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand, and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes. Community resistance thus became an issue for the company, which altered its plans and began to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also powered by natural gas) that would only be operated in times of increased demand. 

As another example, environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week that essentially will block construction of small power plants in the South Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is a 44-MW plant, though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than 80 MW. A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claiming (among other things) that the state had failed to perform adequate environmental-review studies. The groups claim that the state should test the plants for their output of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled in favor of the state, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of Appeals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups. The new ruling, which reportedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state must do unprecedented air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31. 

In a report issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSEG, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are ""serious problems with (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure."" According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO, which manages the state's transmission grid, between 1995 and 2000, while statewide demand in New York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by 1,060 MW. 

Consequently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York remained strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new generation capacity. However, Astoria Energy, which seeks to bring new generation online in New York that will be based on clean technologies, may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the construction of any new plants in the region (with the exception of peaker units, whose output would be closely regimented). If plans for this plant are blocked or significantly altered, following the experience of Sithe Energies, the options to resolve New York City's supply / demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches, including conservation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives.

"MD Anderson","MD Anderson has approximately 500 job openings, some of which may be suitable for former Enron employees.  The jobs vary but include a number of IT and administrative positions.  

MD Anderson's potential interest in employing laid off Enron employees came to our attention via Anne Marie Giltrop of MD Anderson who spoke with Angela Davis.  This morning, I spoke with Ms. Giltrop.  In light of our policy of only providing neutral references and other liability considerations, I stated that I did not believe we would provide MD Anderson a list of employees who were laid off, but that I would try to find an approved vehicle for getting information regarding job openings at MD Anderson to our former employees.  The MD Anderson web site does not reflect all current open positions, so I suggested that, if approved on both ends, MD Anderson could provide a list of openings with job descriptions that could be made available to former Enron employees.  Ms. Giltrop is attempting to obtain appropriate approval from MD Anderson.  She later phoned to inform me that I should expect to hear more from Deborah Manning, Jim Dorn, or Martha Jones.  

On our end, I have contacted David Oxley who put me in touch with Cindy Olson.  Sarah Davis will now handle coordinating relations with MD Anderson.  This is an important opportunity for former employees, and for Enron and MD Anderson as good Houston citizens.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

"Another Version of Negative CTC Risk?","I have a concern about Enron's forward-looking exposure associated with legacy deals (deals that existed during the June 2000 through the May 2001 price shock).  If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001.  This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills.  My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals.  For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.

I have not received clear guidance from legal on this matter.  For example, I asked both Mike Smith and Steve Hall to review the legacy Safeway contract which is on PGES paper.  They both indicated that there is a better chance than not that we are on the hook for these charges, although good arguments could be made that we should not be responsible for them.  Angela Schwarz indicated to me that outside counsel (I'm not sure who) thinks that we are not on the hook for these charges.

It is critical that we get clear guidance from legal on these risks.  We are in front of customers now deciding whether or not to go forward with extensions or terminate contracts after the initial term.  Customers are asking us to make changes to our ""change in law"" and ""utility non-performance"" provisions.  If we believe that we are wearing the surcharge risks beyond the term of the existing contract and the customer is willing to take those from us in exchange for changes to the master agreement we would probably be willing to do it.  If we aren't currently wearing surcharge risk beyond the term of the existing contract then our negotiating position would be different.

As you all know, the magnitude of this risk is potentially large as our negative CTC receivable is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  If the CPUC were to adopt Edison's proposal for the entire state, EES' customers would be responsible for surcharges of the same magnitude.  At this point, I don't know whether EES or its customers are on the hook for this risk beyond the term of existing contracts.

agosto de 1994, e altera??es posteriores, em fun??o do grau de transfer?ncia
do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente.
? 1? Para efeito do disposto neste artigo, considera-se efetiva a
transfer?ncia do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente, com a poss?vel
redu??o do fator de pondera??o a ele aplic?vel, quando:
I - o contrato estabelecer como eventos de cr?dito, no m?nimo, a ocorr?ncia
individual ou conjunta das situa??es previstas no art. 2?, inciso II;
II - o ativo subjacente for legalmente pass?vel de transfer?ncia, nos casos
em que o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito assim o preveja na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito;
III - a contraparte transferidora do risco n?o retiver risco de cr?dito sob
qualquer forma;
IV - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite o cancelamento unilateral
do contrato pela contraparte receptora do risco de cr?dito, exceto na
hip?tese do n?o pagamento pela contraparte transferidora da remunera??o
estabelecida no art. 1?, incisos I e II;
V - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite, ? contraparte receptora do
risco de cr?dito, o n?o cumprimento da obriga??o de efetuar prontamente o
pagamento do montante devido ? contraparte transferidora na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito.
? 2? O fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, a ser aplicado ao montante
de prote??o do ativo subjacente para fins de apura??o do PLE deve ser obtido
com base na seguinte f?rmula:
FP = (1 - F) x (PRP x 50)/PRA + [1- (PRP/PRA)] x FPA + F x FPA, onde:
FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo
subjacente;
PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);
PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);
FPA = Fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, relativo ao ativo
subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o
art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e
altera??es posteriores;
F = ""zero"" nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser contratado na mesma
moeda que o ativo subjacente;
F = 0,50 (cinq?enta cent?simos) nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser
contratado em outra moeda que n?o a do ativo subjacente.
? 3? A exposi??o ao risco do ativo subjacente que exceder o montante
de prote??o deve ser ponderada pelo seu fator original conforme a Tabela de
Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo
IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e altera??es posteriores.
? 4? Na hip?tese em que estipulada cl?usula relativa a valores ou
percentuais m?nimos de perda do ativo subjacente para que a recomposi??o,
total ou parcial, seja efetuada, deve ser comprovada parcela adicional de
PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.
Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do
ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.
Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco
garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em
esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco
decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele
aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele
aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es
financeiras, de informa??es contendo, pelo menos, os seguintes aspectos
relativos ?s opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito:
I - pol?tica, objetivos e estrat?gias da institui??o;
II - processo de gerenciamento de riscos;
III - volumes de risco de cr?dito transferidos (valor cont?bil e de
mercado), total e no per?odo;
IV - receitas e/ou despesas no per?odo;
V - efeito (aumento/redu??o) no c?lculo do PLE;
VI - montante e caracter?sticas das opera??es de cr?ditos
transferidas ou recebidas no per?odo em decorr?ncia dos fatos geradores
previstos no contrato;
VII - segrega??o por tipo (swap de cr?dito e swap de taxa de retorno total).
Art. 6? O Banco Central do Brasil poder? determinar o aumento do PLE, com
base em caracter?sticas intr?nsecas ao contrato.
Art. 7? As institui??es devem manter, ? disposi??o do Banco Central
do Brasil, adequadamente documentadas, sua pol?tica e procedimentos para
realiza??o de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, bem como os limites de
exposi??o estabelecidos, independentemente da condi??o de receptora ou
transferidora do risco.
Art. 8? Fica condicionada ? autoriza??o do Banco Central do Brasil a
celebra??o de contrato de derivativo de cr?dito cujo montante seja igual ou
superior a 10% (dez por cento) valor do Patrim?nio de Refer?ncia (PR) da
institui??o que atuar como contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 9? A institui??o deve informar ao Departamento de Cadastro e
Informa??es do Sistema financeiro (Decad) o nome do diretor respons?vel pela
pr?tica de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, nos termos do art. 3? da

"BANKRUPTCY CONFERENCE CALL TODAY AT 2:00 p.m.","Netting Legislation Update

House (Financial Services Committee/Toomey) and Senate (Gramm) staff met
this afternoon to agree on provisions for a stand-alone netting bill that is
likely to be brought-up under a suspension vote in the House next week.
This morning Gramm's office indicated that most of the bill looked fine
(including the Section 562 modification) except for the 907A provisions,
which they believed to be covered in the October 4 SEC-CFTC Rule on
""Customer protection, Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Bankruptcy Rules and the
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 to Accounts Holding Security
Futures Products"".  We are currently vetting this view with the CFTC and
SEC. Gramm's staff (Linda Lord/Sarah DuMont) reiterated their concern in
this afternoon's meeting.  
Apologies for the late notice but we have been asked for our views today as
to whether we wish to keep the provisions in the underlying bill or if we
support dropping the provisions. We would like to schedule a conference call
ASAP to receive your views about these provisions.

State PUC seeks to void Davis' power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Monday, October 1, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/01/MN48825.DTL>
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
""The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,"" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. ""I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down."" 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
""It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
""It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,"" Hidalgo said. ""If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up."" 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
""We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,"" Lynch said last week. ""We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
""The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,"" he said. ""Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract."" 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
""Now another California agency is disputing it,"" Mitchell said. ""We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored."" 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
""News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,"" the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. 
PG&E'S PLANT PROPOSAL
PG&E Corp. has proposed to emerge from bankruptcy protection by transferring all the power plants it still owns, as well as its natural gas and power transmission lines, into subsidiaries free of state regulation. 
PG&E says it will protect consumers from a replay of this year's price spikes by selling the power from its new free-market plants at a stable rate through contracts that phase out in nine to 12 years. 
Consumer advocates and state regulators say that stable rate -- 5 cents a kilowatt hour -- is more than 60 percent higher than PG&E now gets under state regulation. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County), warned that the state could be heading into a second wave of the energy crisis. 
""The problem with this new phase we're going into is that the concepts are more theoretical and the impacts are very much delayed,"" Keeley said. ""There won't be the same urgency to wrestle this energy monster to the ground.""

We have written at least twice explaining we are not prepared to pay any of this back. I'll ask Matt to do so again one last time.



					Mark

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Mirant Becomes No. 2 Gas Marketer; 
New Acquisition Cements Canada as Top Spot for Gas Resources 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from PR Newswire] Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) announced on Oct. 11 that it intends to acquire the majority of the gas marketing business of Calgary-based TransCanada Pipelines Limited, a move that would make the company the largest natural-gas marketer in Canada, the largest natural-gas exporter to the United States and the number-two gas marketer in North America. Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, although it is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, pending approvals from regulators, producers and customers. 

Analysis: It's nothing short of amazing the number of natural-gas transactions that have taken place between U.S. integrated energy firms and Canadian gas companies in 2001 alone. As is often the case, what seemed like a trend now appears to be an industry standard, as those U.S. power firms consolidating in the natural-gas sector look northward to Canada for acquisition targets. Canada, which offers seemingly abundant natural-gas resources, has attracted such U.S. energy companies Calpine, Devon and Duke, which have also bought gas outlets in the Great White North this year. This particular acquisition is significant because it positions Mirant, which already had assets in the Western part of Canada, as the largest gas marketer in Canada and right behind Enron elsewhere in North America, especially in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast. Further, the purchase of TransCanada gives Mirant a decided edge on the increasing exports of natural gas from Canada to the United States, adding upon its already-significant portfolio. 

As always when discussing a merger or acquisition, I like to first establish the key elements of the deal before addressing the larger strategic gains of the parties involved. Mirant is of course the recently spun off, former subsidiary of Southern Company which over the last year has become one of the most aggressive and visible energy companies operating in the unregulated wholesale sector. The company's business model is founded on building a huge arsenal of generating assets, particularly based in natural gas, which can be marketed and traded in strategic regions. Even before the announcement of this acquisition, Mirant owned an estimated 96 billion cubic feet of proven oil and gas reserves, 82 percent of which are natural gas. According to the company, a substantial portion of its 38 million cubic feet equivalent per day that is in current production is contracted to be sold at an average fixed price of $4/MMBtu through 2002. Further, Mirant has established a solid reputation as a leading gas marketer and trader in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. The purchase of TransCanada's gas marketing business will add 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas reserves to Mirant's existing volumes (based on TransCanada's 2000 trading volumes), which as noted significantly elevates Mirant's stature in the gas-marketing space. 

The most important thing to note about TransCanada's business model is that the company has established a strong niche in transporting natural gas from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and Canada's Mackenzie Delta into the growing North American marketplace, supporting two separate pipelines (one from each basin). This has been a slow-growth business for TransCanada, and in fact has lost money over the last year, but is positioned for strong growth in the future given the projected increase in demand for natural gas in North America. TransCanada has been attempting to sell its gas marketing business for some time in an effort to focus more exclusively on its North American gas transmission and electrical power services. Last month, the company sold another chunk of its U.S. natural-gas marketing and trading operations to BP Gas and Power. Some of the motivation for TransCanada to focus exclusively on this business might have arisen from concerns about perceived conflicts between its marketing / shipping business and pipeline systems. 

From a broad perspective, this is a good move for Mirant. As noted, the company already has assets in Western Canada, where it has operated since June 2000 through its management of the natural-gas marketing operations of Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. and CanWest Gas Supply, Inc. The purchase of core businesses of TransCanada extends Mirant's presence into Eastern Canada by gaining control over TransCanada's Quebec and Ontario operations. Specifically, Mirant gains control over TransCanada's natural-gas trading and marketing business and the related transportation and storage contracts, with business contracts in the Midwest and Northeast United States. In addition, TransCanada has agreed to sell its ""netback pool,"" or the part of its operation that has aggregated gas supply from about 550 natural-gas producers. As noted, the aggregated supply should increase Mirant's marketable reserves by 5.1 billion cubic feet per day. Although financial terms were not disclosed, a Mirant executive indicated that the acquisition would enable the company to establish a leading market position through minimal investment. 

The acquisition of TransCanada is by no means a surprise as it factors in very well to Mirant's growth strategy. Just this week, Mirant announced that it had acquired an interest in 18 natural-gas and oil producing fields as well as 206,000 acres of mineral rights in South Louisiana from Castex Energy. This purchase followed purchases announced last August in which Mirant agreed to acquire two power plants in Florida and Georgia from El Paso Corporation. The additional generating capacity from the El Paso facilities would bring Mirant closer to its aggressive target of owning or controlling 35,000 MW in North America by 2005. Mirant is acquiring from El Paso a 640-MW natural gas-fired power plant in Thomaston, Ga., and a 480-MW natural gas-fired plant in New Port Richey, Fla., north of Tampa. The agreement is expected to close this month, pending regulatory and third-party approvals. 

As noted, Mirant is just the latest in a string of U.S. energy companies that have made purchases of Canadian gas companies. Driven by what appear to be abundant natural-gas reserve fields in Canada, and uncertain resources in more traditional areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the gas consolidation movement among U.S. energy companies includes acquiring those firms that are involved in both production and transportation of natural gas. Some recent reports I've seen have indicated that, since 1991, natural-gas imports to the United States (mostly coming from Canada) have doubled to about 10 billion cubic feet per day, while domestic production has increased only 4 percent (although it still averages 52 billion cubic feet per day). Further, according to the Department of Energy, U.S. imports of natural gas from Canada have averaged about 15 percent of total U.S. usage (during 2000, the United States consumed 22.8 Tcf and imported about 3.6 Tcf, mostly from Canada). The other factor driving this interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is the relatively lower valuations of Canadian energy stocks. 

Worth noting in this movement is Duke Energy, which announced its purchase of Canada's Westcoast Energy for $3.5 billion in late September. Westcoast Energy owns the main pipeline that transports natural gas into the United States, which is a booming market for natural-gas demand given its use in new power plant projects. The acquisition should give Duke control over natural-gas supply in Canada and the pipelines needed to export it. It is important to note that Duke has found its niche in the Canadian natural-gas market by focusing on the transportation of the commodity. Mirant is taking a different approach by focusing on the marketing side of the business. Also worth noting in the Canadian market is Devon Energy, which is buying Anderson Exploration, which reportedly will position it as the largest independent producer of oil and natural gas in North America. 

Ironically, this increased interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is taking place at a time when Canadian natural-gas storage levels could be much higher than reported, bringing prices down to (CAN) $1.75 per million cubic feet over the next few weeks. In fact, natural-gas prices in Canada have dropped about 80 percent since the beginning of 2001, with Alberta's benchmark AECO-C Hub prices dropping more than 40 percent in the past two months. In addition to the high storage levels, mild weather, a drop in consumption of natural gas and the struggling North American economy are also considered to be factors in the drop in prices. However, this does appear to be a temporary trend, and companies such as Mirant are betting that prices will once again increase, starting with the imminent winter season. 

Moreover, as noted the purchase of TransCanada will reportedly make Mirant the second-largest gas marketer in North America. According to the most current data available, based on 2000 sales, Enron Wholesale Services remains the largest natural-gas marketer in North America, with 28.3 billion cubic feet / day of sales in 2000, representing an 82.6-percent increase over 1999 levels. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trade, Coral Energy, and Reliant Energy round out the top companies. Interestingly, Mirant was not even listed on the year-2000 sales ranking because it did not fully spin off from parent Southern Company until late in the year. Consequently, the ascendance into the top tier of natural-gas marketers that Mirant should achieve through this single purchase of TransCanada is quite impressive.

Credit Derivatives
FOW - November 7, 2001
By Jane Douglas-Jones

In the weeks following the terrorist attacks in the US, credit derivative
traders reported record levels of activity. ""In the immediate aftermath of
the events of 11 September trade ticket size went down,"" says one broker. ""A
lot of people were prepared to make markets in $5m or euros where previously
the average ticket size was $10-15m. The nominal size of the trade went down
as a result of the level of uncertainty and volatility in the markets.""

Traders report that credit default swap trade volume soared to three times
the normal level. ""If nominal ticket value went down by half and trade
volume went up three-fold, overall volumes were up by 5 00/0 in terms of the
actual business being written,"" explains the broker.  After the initial
shock of the devastating attacks, the market recovered its poise and
analysts and traders soon realised the credits that would be most affected.

""Clearly, airline stocks took a pummelling,"" says one trader. ""Prior to the
event, British Airways was trading around 100 basis points for five year
default swaps. After the attacks, BA widened dramatically to 350/SOObp.
Spreads on this credit did come in from this level, but they have since gone
back out again and are currently trading around 380/450bp. Meanwhile, we saw
a credit event on Swiss Air, and German airline Lufthansa also went out,
with all the European airlines following suit.""

Insurance sector
As was expected, the credit derivatives market also saw heightened activity
in the insurance and reinsurance sector. ""There has been a lot of activity
around companies such as Zurich Re,"" says the trader. ""Zurich spreads moved
out from around	20/40bp to 50/100bp. The credit did trade towards the
offered side once or twice. Zurich spreads have stayed in this range despite
the fact that the company has downsized its profits and upsized its
predicted loss (effectively doubling the amount of provision) as a result of
the terrorist attacks.""

Similarly, names such as AXA, Agon, and Aliance have all been actively
quoted in the aftermath of 11 September and spreads have widened
considerably on these names. For example, as FOW went to press Aliance
spreads went out to 7Obp before tracking back in to 35/55bp. In addition,
sectors that have not been considered directly affected by the attacks, such
as the auto sector, also moved out as a result of the potential slowdown in
the US.

""We have seen principle investors in the credit derivatives market trading
either with a view or going by what the spot markets are doing,"" says one
dealer. ""We have also seen quite a few investors gaining synthetic exposure
to bonds by selling default swaps.  Recent weeks have proved a significant
test of the liquidity in the default swaps market. In some areas, the bond
market was extremely thin and it was difficult to trade. However, with
default swaps there was always a price in no more than five minutes. The
market was both traded and tradable.""

Europe
The European credit derivatives market has also had to contend with the
demise of the UK's train operator, Railtrack. ""Railtrack is going to be a
credit event on bankruptcy rather than restructuring,"" says one structurer.
""There was a thought initially that it would go via restructuring and that
would have been an interesting test of the modified ISDA restructuring
supplement. This is still very much an issue in the market. While the US has
adopted the new version, by far the majority of business being done in
Europe and Asia uses the original ISDA 1999 definition of restructuring. The
new restructuring Z supplement has simply not been accepted and I do not
think it ever will be accepted. I expect that we will soon move back along
the lines of the original ISDA wording with perhaps one or two tweaks. 

Overall, traders say that the market has survived the seismic shock of the
events of 11 September extremely well. ""There was no mad panic,"" says one
broker. ""The credit derivatives market made a fair and measured response in
the face of tragedy."" 


ISDA publishes amendments to master agreements
IFR - November 3, 2001

As part of its effort to improve counter-party risk management practices,
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last week released nine
amendments that can be added as attachments to ISDA master agreements. Many
of the changes included in the document were inspired by the market
turbulence in 1998, ISDA said. Ultimately, the amendments will form the
basis of an initial draft of a new master agreement.

Using one amendment, a failure to pay becomes a default one local delivery
day after notice of such failure is given to the relevant party. ""Many
market participants found three local business days after notice to be too
long a period during times of market stress in 1998"" ISDA noted in a
commentary on the amendments. A local delivery day is a day on which
settlement systems are generally open for business.

Under a second amendment, market participants can use a replacement value
method of valuing transactions after early termination of a master
agreement. The replacement method combines elements of the market quotation
and loss methods into one valuation provision, 1SDA said, noting that the
quotation or loss methods are still valid. Because the inability to
communicate notices via email or fax proved unduly restrictive in 1998, an
amendment was added allowing market participants to use these channels to
give notices.

An amendment stating that the occurrence of termination events should be
treated in a manner similar to an event of default also featured on ISDA's
new list of amendments that may be tacked on to master agreements.
According to ISDA, this option was added because a number of members hold
the view that most termination events are credit-related.

ISDA initiated a review of its master agreements' provisions in 1999. The
process took into account recommendations by the counter-party risk
management policy group's 1999 report ""Improving Counter-Party Risk
Management"".


Emerging market issuers press ahead 
Financial Times - November 7, 2001
By Arkady Ostrovsky

Emerging market borrowers are pressing ahead with planned international bond
issues, despite a deepening debt crisis in Argentina. 

Fitch, the credit rating agency, yesterday said Argentina's planned debt
swap would amount to a default. Fitch cut Argentina's credit rating from CC
to C, indicating an imminent default, and left it on rating watch negative. 

""Although the proposed debt exchange has been described as voluntary, public
statements by Argentine officials imply that in the absence of such an
exchange, public debt held by domestic investors is unlikely to be
serviced,"" Fitch said. 

Fitch also said the terms of the new instruments would be inferior to those
of existing debt, including lower coupons and longer maturities. 

However, despite all this, emerging markets remained surprisingly calm with
no visible signs of contagion developing. Emerging markets bond spreads had
hardly moved since last Friday's announcement and the yield spread of some
countries, including Brazil, had even tightened. This is because there is
little leverage in the system, compared with the 1998 Russian crisis, and
because most market participants were prepared for an Argentine default. 

Several emerging market issuers said they were pressing ahead with bonds
despite Argentina's troubles. 

Bulgaria is likely to launch its debut euro-denominated international bond
next week. Its finance minister said yesterday the country would not launch
the bond if it had to pay a coupon above 8.5 per cent. 

But bankers close to the deal were confident Bulgaria could borrow at
between 7 and 8 per cent, or between 380 and 420 basis points over the
eurozone benchmark, depending on the maturity. Bulgaria is considering a
three-year or five-year issue of up to Euros 255m. 

Emerging market analysts said Bulgaria's economy was in good shape, despite
eurozone economic slowdown and falling export revenues. The country, rated
B2 by Moody's and B+ by Standard & Poor's, has attracted healthy levels of
foreign direct investment by selling its banks to foreign banks, has pegged
its currency to the euro and has met several Maastricht criteria. 

""Bulgaria is the final country to offer extra value as an EU convergence
play. It is unrecognisable as the state engulfed by crisis five years ago,""
said Charles Robertson, emerging markets analyst at ING Barings. 

Latvia, which is on a roadshow in London today, is also pushing ahead with a
bond issue. Sibneft, Russia's oil company, said it would also go ahead with
a three-year Dollars 250m bond issue this month, although other oil
companies have chosen to postpone their issues until next year. If
successful, Sibneft could become the first Russian corporate to issue
international bonds since the 1998 crisis. 

Moody's yesterday assigned Sibneft a rating of B1, a notch above Russia's
sovereign credit rating. 


Dumping ""W""
FOW - November 2001
By Jane Douglas-Jones

Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has been busy in recent weeks. The
Committee has issued guidance to banks on customer due diligence processes,
reviewed its Internal Ratings Based Approach (EBB) to specialised lending
exposures, and published crucial papers on operational risk and market
discipline. In addition, the credit derivatives market breathed a sign of
relief at the Committee's decision to dump 'w'.
In the first of a series of updates on the proposed new Basel Capital
Accord, the Basel Committee's Capital Group has decided to incorporate the
'w' factor (a residual risk charge for credit derivatives) into pillar two
of the Accord's framework, which deals with the supervisory review process.

This move was welcomed by the banking industry and the International Swaps &
Derivatives Association (ISDA), neither of which has been backward in
expressing disapproval of 'w'. The news that the charge is to be assimilated
elsewhere in the Accord came as no surprise given the uproar since w's birth
in the January 2001 Basel consultative paper. As FOW reported (see May
issue, It's the end of
as we know it, page 21), the charge was derided, at ISDA's AGM, by the very
regulators one would expect to defend it and the future of the 'w' factor
has looked bleak since then.

However, some market participants were worried that the Committee would
stand by the charge both because of the immaturity of the credit derivatives
market and also because of the worry that credit risk management instruments
could be used for regulatory arbitrage. ""Any sign of traders using a
derivative to 'get around' a capital charge or regulation has been, in the
past, punished by conservative and complex rules,"" says one source. ""Recent
evidence of this can be found in the securitisation market.""

The demise of 'w' has not meant the end of regulator concern about credit
derivatives. The Capital Group states: ""One of the Basel Committee's
objectives in considering the treatment of credit derivatives in the trading
book is to minimise the possibility of regulatory arbitrage... the Capital
Group is planning to specify a rule that is already implemented by many
supervisors. This rule provides that when a bank conducts an internal hedge
of a banking book exposure using a credit derivative in its own trading
book, in order to receive any regulatory capital benefit it must transfer
the credit risk to an outside third party (ie an eligible credit protection
provider).""

Meanwhile, the Accord's add-on matrix for potential future exposure
calculations does not explicitly cover credit derivatives and rules differ
across countries. 'The Capital Group is working ~to provide proposals that
will harmonise this treatment.

Op risk
The Risk Management Group
(RMG) of the Basel Committee
has also been hard at work. The Group has made a number of significant
changes to the January proposals including:
	*	Refinement of the definition of operational risk
	*	Proposed reduction in the overall level of the operational
risk capital charge from 200/0 to 120/0
	*	Introduction of a new regulatory capital approach that is
based on banks' internal risk estimates (the ""Advanced Measurement
Approaches"" [AMA])
	*	Consideration of the role of insurance as a risk mitigant in
the regulatory capital calculations.

The Group now defines op risk as ""the risk of loss resulting from inadequate
or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events"".
 
Due diligence
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US in September, the Basel
Committee has issued guidance and minimum standards to banks on customer due
diligence processes. ""Systemic customer due diligence is an essential
element of banks' risk management,' says William McDonough, chairman of the
Basel Committee. ""It is critical 'to safeguarding confidence and the
integrity of the banking system. The importance of a rigorous approach has
been underscored by the recent terrorist attacks in the US."" 


Basel Committee, IOSCO, IAIS Publish Cross-Sector Reports
Dow Jones Newswires - November 7, 2001

LONDON -- Two cross-sector reports aimed at supervisors in the banking,
securities and insurance industries were published Wednesday by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision, the technical committee of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors.

The reports deal with cross-sectoral comparisons of risk management
practices and regulatory capital, and with core principles of the respective
sectors the organizations deal with.

The reports were published by the Joint Forum, established in 1996 to
examine supervisory issues related to financial conglomerates.

Hi Mark,
 
I hope you are well.
 
Please let me know if you have a position on my previous email. I believe the ECI contracts are with non bankrupt Enron entities (EI) and also they are linked to operating companies in Brazil and Bolivia (the cash considerations were in exchange for a carried interest and for equity options that ECI had a right to).
 
I realize a lot is going on but the unpaid amounts are very big sums from my standpoint and I need to discuss this with someone with the authority to give me Enron's official position. As I said Mark I want to do this before taking any other steps.
 
Thanks,
 
Diomedes.

FASB Adds Performance Reporting Project, Defers Intangible Assets Disclosure
Decision 
BNA - October 25, 2001

NORWALK, Conn.--The Financial Accounting Standards Board Oct. 24 formally
added a project on performance reporting to its rulemaking agenda, but it
deferred a decision on whether to start a separate standard-setting effort
on disclosures about intangible assets.  The topic of intangibles was the
subject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed its
importance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two other
issues vying for the attention of rulemakers. 

FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that an
effort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that form
statements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standards
on revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitable
candidates for rulemaking.  Major U.S. corporations, through at least one
trade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the course
described by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International's
Committee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking on
the performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in a
prospectus issued about two months ago. 

FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.
In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory work
on intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the three
potential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,
simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures about
intangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staff
accountants' time.  The additional work on intangibles is to focus on
summarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-process
research and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focus
on questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,
security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would not
carry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized.  The board tentatively
set a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by its
staff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitive
decision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project in
early 2002.  

'Minimum Approach' in Performance Reporting Effort
FASB's new rulemaking on performance reporting represents an effort to
improve and make more useful information displayed on all the basic
financial statements, both interim and annual. In such a ""display and
presentation"" project, the board would not address recognition and
measurement questions, according to a staff summary.  FASB's staff
recommended that the board ""stick close"" to what is known as the minimum
approach in the performance reporting project, said Ronald Bossio, a senior
staff project manager. Pursuing that approach was the avenue favored by most
of the board's constituents who expressed support for starting the
standard-setting effort. 

The minimum approach is described by FASB's staff as one that would have the
board ""explore whether certain line items, subtotals, and totals should be
defined in standards and required to be displayed in financial statements,
including interim statements.  ""Line items and amounts that would be
considered include those related to metrics commonly used by investors and
creditors in assessing financial performance,"" the staff continued in a
summary distributed at the board's Oct. 24 meeting. 

Favored less by constituents and not advocated so far by any board member in
preliminary discussions is a broader approach. Under that, FASB would
describe how key financial metrics--usually ratios or some other
indicator--should be calculated if they are presented in financial
statements. However, the methods of figuring such metrics would not be
required to be shown in the financial statements, according to the staff's
summary of the broader path. 

Gary Schieneman, a veteran security analyst who joined FASB in July, said he
supports taking on the project on performance reporting. He added, however,
""I think it will be difficult to stick closely to the minimum approach.""
Michael Crooch, a colleague on the board, said he, too, supports the
rulemaking effort, but voiced a concern that the effort ""may be a project
that has no bounds. This is one we have to watch with regard to scope.""  The
International Accounting Standards Board has begun its own standard-setting
on performance reporting. That task is being carried out jointly with the
United Kingdom's Accounting Standards Board in an effort, in part, toward
helping ensure convergence of financial reporting rules around the world.
FASB plans to monitor the IASB-ASB joint project. 

Defining Simplification
Wulff, a former high-ranking financial executive at Union Carbide who joined
FASB with Schieneman, first raised the issue of perhaps taking on other
projects--revenue recognition and simplification--when he was asked to voice
a view on embarking on the performance reporting project.  what
""simplification"" is came to a head in FASB's debate when Wulff, weighing the
intangible assets project, questioned moving ahead on that effort before
understanding how many staff resources would be used in writing standards on
disclosures about intangibles. 

Some in the community of financial statement preparers--generally U.S.
corporations and their trade groups--oppose FASB's taking on the performance
reporting and intangibles projects. Instead, they suggest the accounting
board should begin rulemaking on liability and revenue recognition and what
the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) labels ""FASB
Codification/Simplification.""  FASB board members and IASB's liaison to the
U.S. board, James Leisenring, said they know what codification means. The
name signifies a collection of FASB's authoritative literature and GAAP in
general that should be collected in ""one comprehensive format,"" as IMA's
Financial Reporting Committee wrote in a Sept. 19 letter to the accounting
board. 

However, several board members and Leisenring, FASB's former vice chairman,
regarded arguments for simplification warily, as shown by their comments
Oct. 24.  ""I know what codification is,"" said Leisenring. ""I don't know what
simplification is."" He and FASB members Neel Foster and Katherine Schipper
suggested they know what simplification could mean, but did not elaborate,
instead making veiled references to moves such as requiring full fair
value-based recognition of financial instruments in the income statement,
widely opposed by banks and corporations.

Simplification a Complicated Effort
""I also know that isn't what they want,"" Leisenring said of advocates of a
simplification project. He suggested that, if such a project is anything
like IASB's current effort to improve existing international accounting
standards, simplification would prove not so simple--and would consume
hundreds of hours of staff time ""if it's a serious endeavor.""  Foster
labeled arguments that FASB should begin a simplification effort ""an attempt
to tie this organization up for the next 20 years."" 

Schipper, who alone objected to Jenkins's compromise on the intangibles
project, said the board should begin the rulemaking on disclosures about
intangibles ""immediately"" and proceed ""full speed ahead."" 
Schipper cited the lack of comparability in current reporting on purchased
intangible assets, which are accounted for under FASB's new rules on
business combinations, and on intangibles that are internally generated. The
latter and their values often are not reflected at all in financial
statements, although they are said to be key drivers in the so-called ""new
economy."" 

In-process research and development, which figured prominently in mergers
and acquisitions in the high technology sector, ""needs a very strong look,""
she added.  Schipper, a former accounting professor at the University of
Chicago and Duke University, said of accounting for intangibles: ""This issue
has been studied up and down, left and right, ... from floor to ceiling.
""You may think [the academic] research is stupid and misguided. I don't,""
she said in urging a quick start on standard-setting.

Other Action by FASB
In other action at its Oct. 24 meeting, the board tentatively decided to: 

	*	reactivate its dormant project on costs associated with
activities stemming from disposal of a factory or other hard asset used in a
discontinued business operation and reconsider all of the guidance in Issue
No. 94-3 of FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force, ""Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity,""
including one-time employee termination benefits and other restructuring
costs; 

	*	issue draft rules in mid-November to rescind FASB Statement
No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and to make
miscellaneous technical corrections, including non-substantive changes to
FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and amendments related to FASB
Statements No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets; and 

	*	consider at an upcoming meeting plans to revive--and most
likely head in a different rulemaking direction than previously pursued--the
board's 20-year-old project on consolidations policy, or defining when an
affiliate of a company should be deemed a subsidiary and have its activities
included in the financial statements of the parent.

In previous incarnations of FASB, an accounting model based on control of an
entity did not garner enough support to advance to a final accounting
standard and was criticized strongly by FEI and others. The control-based
model departed from the traditional majority equity ownership model, which
several FASB members suggest is not followed in current practice despite its
standing as accounting gospel.


Railtrack, Swissair First Test of Europe's Default Swap Market
Bloomberg - October 2001
By Tom Kohn

Europe's $250 billion market for credit default swaps, a form of insurance
against companies missing their debt payments, is getting its first test as
Railtrack Plc and Swissair Group wrestle with insolvency. 

Credit default swaps let banks and other investors juggle the risk that a
bond or loan won't be paid back. The buyer of such protection pays an annual
premium, and the seller pays if there's a so-called credit event, such as a
company going bankrupt. 

``Railtrack is the bigger of the two tests to the overall market,'' said
Dale Lattanzio, head of structured credit trading at Merrill Lynch & Co.
``While the government said the bonds will be OK, under the terms of the
contract it triggered a credit event, and the credit derivatives market is
treating it'' as such. 

Britain's government seized control of Railtrack on Sunday to stop the owner
of the U.K.'s rail network going bankrupt. It would have debts of 700
million pounds ($1 billion) by December and 1.7 billion pounds by March,
government lawyer David Richards told the High Court. Railtrack owes
bondholders more than $2.2 billion. 

Swissair is seeking bankruptcy protection after running out of money Oct. 1.
Europe's seventh-biggest airline owes bondholders $2.6 billion. The
company's market value is currently $48 million, after its shares fell 97
percent this year. 

Settling Claims 

Default swaps traded for both companies, and were triggered by the
announcements. 

``We're going through the process of settling claims,'' said Lattanzio.
``There's a broad agreement in the London-based credit derivatives market,
and it's been fairly orderly with no market disruptions.'' 

Sellers of credit protection aren't likely to refuse to pay out on their
contracts, traders said. Still, because the companies' near-bankruptcies
sparked swap payments it will test the legal contracts on which the banks
rely. 

Credit derivative agreements depend on legal documents developed by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which represents about 540
securities firms. Banks use ISDA contracts for credit default swaps to
ensure their agreements won't collapse if unexpected events occur. 

ISDA defines a credit event as ``bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation
default, obligation acceleration, repudiation or moratorium, and
restructuring.'' 

``The likelihood is that the documentation should stand up,'' said Ruth
Ainslie, senior policy director at ISDA in New York. She said that depends
if banks used ISDA agreements and ``whether or not they have been radically
changed.'' ISDA has received legal opinions on Swiss and U.K. jurisdiction,
because ISDA contracts cover a ``very broad range'' of agreements, she said.


`Consternation' 

The U.K. government plans to transfer Railtrack's bonds into a new company,
rated at least ``BBB'' by Standard & Poor's and ``Baa2'' by Moody's.
Bondholders would get interest and be repaid when the debt matures at
``broadly'' the same terms, Transport Secretary Stephen Byers said this
week. 

``Initially there was consternation when Railtrack was put into
receivership,'' said Ned Swan, a partner and derivatives specialist at law
firm Simmons & Simmons. Still, ``it's a major company with major assets. It
was a surprise, but these things will be worked out.'' 

The Bank of England estimates the credit derivatives market has a face value
of about $1 trillion, with credit default swaps accounting for about half
the market. London trading accounts for ``just under'' half the market. Up
to 2,000 swaps on companies are traded, with 500 to 1,000 trading
``actively.'' the bank said in a June report. 

The central bank cited British Bankers' Association and U.S. government
figures as well as its own estimates. The U.S. Office for the Comptroller of
the Currency reported U.S. commercial banks had credit derivatives with a
face value of $351 billion at the end of the second quarter. 

U.K. securities watchdog the Financial Services Authority monitors the banks
trading credit default swaps, though doesn't regulate credit derivatives. 

``We don't regulate it as a product,'' said Karin Loudon, an FSA
spokeswoman. ``It's up to the banks to manage their own legal risk.'' 

UBS AG sued Deutsche Bank AG for $10 million at Britain's high court in
March for failing to pay on a default swap when Armstrong World Industries
Inc., the U.S.'s biggest vinyl-flooring maker, defaulted on its debt. 

The dispute centered on Armstrong's name, because the contract referred to
its parent company, Armstrong Holdings Inc., according to the court filing.
The two banks settled the suit March 15. An FSA spokesman said at the time
that regulators don't typically intervene in such cases because banks
usually resolve disputes among themselves. 


Canada Publishes Final Regulations To Implement Financial Services Framework

BNA - October 25, 2001

OTTAWA--The Canadian government has implemented new framework legislation
for the financial services sector, including domestic and foreign banks,
trust companies, insurance companies, credit unions and other financial
institutions, Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions)
James Peterson said Oct. 24. 

Implementation of Bill C-8, An Act to establish the Financial Consumer
Agency of Canada and to amend certain Acts in relation to financial
institutions, coincides with the publication of a finalized package of
regulations necessary to give effect to the legislation's provisions,
Peterson said in a statement. 

""The measures contained in Bill C-8 will help to ensure that the Canadian
financial services sector continues to be among the safest and most
accessible in the world,"" he said. ""The legislation will promote efficiency
and growth in the sector, foster international competitiveness and domestic
competition, empower and protect consumers of financial services, and
improve the regulatory environment."" 

The legislation also creates the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, which
begins operations Oct. 24 and will enforce compliance with the legislation's
consumer provisions and educate consumers on how the legislation benefits
them, he said. The new agency has been in the public spotlight recently as a
necessary element of the federal government's efforts to track down and
freeze assets in Canada of international terrorist organizations. 

The Department of Finance published the finalized package of 75 regulations
in the Oct. 24, 2001 issue of the Canada Gazette, Part II. The regulations
are particularly important because a key element of the new financial
framework is the use of regulations to provide a more flexible regulatory
environment for the financial sector, said a regulatory impact analysis
statement published with the finalized regulations. 

""This allows the government to make modest policy adjustments to the
framework in response to significant changes taking place in the global
environment in which financial institutions operate. Many regulations are
being proposed or modified in order to achieve this policy objective of
creating a more flexible regulatory regime,"" the impact analysis statement
said. 

The current proposals are the first of several packages of regulations that
will be brought forward to implement the policy intent of the new Act, and
will include regulations essential to operation of the legislation, it said.


Of the 75 regulations, 37 relate to the new framework's restructuring of the
permitted investment regime, while 18 are related to the new holding company
regime for financial institutions, six relate to creation of the new
Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, six relate to changes to the foreign
bank regime and the remaining eight are aimed at various other policy
objectives, it said. 

Key areas of the regulations relate to the activities of banks include: 


	*	definition of ""aggregate financial exposure"" for banks
engaging in certain transactions with related parties that are not federally
regulated financial institutions; 

	*	limits on the commercial lending activities of financial
institutions other than banks; 

	*	requirements for financial institutions to inform customers
with a complaint about a product or service on how to contact the Financial
Consumer Agency of Canada; 

	*	exemption of certain classes of entities from the status of
being an entity associated with a foreign bank and exemption of certain
classes of entities from the definition of foreign bank; 

	*	definition of the term ""equity"" when used in dealing with
ownership rules for banks and demutualized insurance companies; 

	*	rules on the investment powers of entities in which a
financial institution holds more than 10 percent of the voting shares or 25
percent of the equity, but not control; 

	*	definition of ""financial leasing""; 

	*	prescription of a range of information-processing activities
permitted for banks and authorized foreign banks, including payroll
processing, clearing and management of deposit accounts; 

	*	prescribed limits for the amounts of real property and
equity investments permitted for financial institutions; 

	*	rules governing the ability of an entity to identify itself
as a member of a group in describing its corporate relationship with a
foreign bank; 

	*	prohibitions that apply to a foreign bank's real property
activities outside of its authorized foreign bank branch; 

	*	rules governing the content of a prospectus; 

	*	expansion of the scope of commercial companies in which
financial institutions are permitted to invest, subject to a number of
constraints and caps; and 

	*	provisions permitting regulated securities entities to hold
shares of a parent bank holding company to a limit of one percent of the
bank holding company's regulatory capital.

End Of Cantor Treasurys Quotes On Telerate Causes Bother
Dow Jones - October 25, 2001
TOKYO -- Some Japanese institutional investors were a little peeved Thursday
when information provider Telerate stopped offering Treasurys' pricing from
major inter-dealer broker Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, but the change
hasn't hampered trading of U.S. government debt, said Tokyo traders.

Telerate, owned by Moneyline, stopped posting Cantor Fitzgerald real-time
U.S. Treasury bond pricing on its screens globally from 5:00 p.m. EDT
Wednesday. The information and data provider said it would replace the
service with price quotes from rival inter-dealer broker BrokerTec Global
LLC. But as of 0700 GMT (3:00 a.m. EDT Thursday) the display remained blank.
The reason for the change wasn't immediately clear.
""Investors have called in to say it's inconvenient that they can't check the
Cantor page (on Telerate) and have asked about prices,"" said a foreign
securities house trader in Tokyo. ""They are now logging onto the Cantor's
website or having to set up a Cantor page on a Bloomberg terminal.""

Apart from a bit of hassle suffered by some investors, however, impact on
trading was limited.
Even with comprehensive on-screen price data investors will typically phone
up several brokerages to get bond price quotes before deciding to trade,
said a trader at a large Japanese insurance company. Losing access to price
indications wouldn't change that practice, he added.

Brokerage and bank Treasurys dealers, and their colleagues in the swaps
market, were unaffected as apparently none of them rely solely on the
Telerate service for U.S. debt security pricing information, traders said.
Telerate continues to provide limited non real-time U.S. government bond
pricing data from Cantor Fitzgerald and other brokers on a separate display.


The Case for Catastrophe Bonds
The New York Times - October 25, 2001
By Hal R. Varian

The insurance industry faces claims of at least $40 billion tied to the
World Trade Center attacks, and it remains exposed to significant risk from
future incidents. Retail insurance companies are considering exclusions for
terrorist damage, leaving property owners unable to buy the coverage they
need.

The problem lies in the reinsurance industry, the wholesale market where
insurers lay off large risks to pools of investors willing to absorb them.
Warren E. Buffett's reinsurance company, General Re, has done well in the
last few years offering property reinsurance because there have not been
major hurricanes or earthquakes. But its luck ran out last month: General Re
has said it is liable for over $2 billion of the total industry losses in
the Sept. 11 attacks.

Earthquakes and hurricanes, unpleasant as they are, present manageable
risks: insurers know roughly how often they occur in various places, what
their likely magnitudes are and how much property damage might be expected.

Terrorist risk is much harder to quantify, leading to the current paralysis
in the reinsurance market. The insurance industry has been lobbying in
Washington to make the federal government the insurer of last resort against
terrorism, which means that taxpayers will end up bearing the financial risk
of future attacks.

Britain adopted a government-backed reinsurance market several years ago
and, so far, it has worked reasonably well. But there is another way to
supplement traditional reinsurance markets that has been attracting
increasing attention: catastrophe bonds. These bonds, generally sold to
large institutions, have typically been tied to natural disasters, like
earthquakes or hurricanes, but they could, in principle, be used to provide
financial backing for terrorism insurance.

Here is how they work. A financial intermediary, like a reinsurance company
or an investment bank, issues a bond tied to a particular insurable event,
like a Los Angeles earthquake. If there is no earthquake, investors are paid
a generous interest rate. But if the earthquake occurs and the claims exceed
an amount specified in the bond, investors sacrifice their principal and
interest.

How generous does the interest rate have to be? That is left up to the
market. If the bond sales offer cheaper reinsurance coverage than do
traditional private placements used in the reinsurance market, these bonds,
known as cat bonds, are a preferred method of finance.

Cat bonds are a form of ""contingent security,"" a concept first formulated by
Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, winner of the 1972 Nobel in
economic science. 

Back in 1952, Professor Arrow came up with the idea of a security that would
pay a fixed amount of money depending on whether or not some event occurred.
He showed that portfolios of such contingent securities could be used to
allocate virtually any kind of risk in an efficient manner.

The analysis by Professor Arrow was long thought to be of only theoretical
interest. But it turned out that all sorts of options and other derivatives
could be best understood using contingent securities. Now Wall Street rocket
scientists draw on this 50-year-old work when creating exotic new
derivatives.

There are a number of special cases of contingent securities. Consider a
security tied to my house burning down. This would certainly affect my net
worth, but would have negligible impact on the owners of the other 70
million housing units in the United States.

This kind of personal risk can easily be shared among many people, each
paying only a small amount if the event occurs, and homeowners insurance is
to ease this kind of risk sharing.

This works fine for small independent risks, but there are other sorts of
events that impose large costs on many people at the same time, like
earthquakes or hurricanes. Insurance companies are able to deal with such
events using reinsurance markets, where the risk is transferred to large
investors.

There are other financial institutions that also allow for risk transfer for
this sort of widespread risk. The orange juice futures market in Chicago is
essentially a market in a contingent security tied to whether it freezes in
Orlando, Fla.

A futures market allows market participants who bear a significant risk
(like farmers worried that their crop might be destroyed) to transfer some
of that risk to others, who are, of course, paid to absorb it. The futures
market allows shifting of risk rather than a simple sharing of risk.

Risk sharing and risk shifting are familiar terms, but there is another
phenomenon worth noting, something I like to call ""risk shafting."" This is
when some risk - often a particularly large risk - is transferred to a third
party who is forced to bear it involuntarily.

In many cases, these third parties are taxpayers, who are not even aware of
their potential liability.

Hence the debate that is going on in Washington now: should the insurance
industry be able to transfer the risk from future terrorist attacks to
taxpayers? Or would it be better to use existing reinsurance markets or new
financial instruments like catastrophe bonds to shift the risk to those
willing and able to bear it if appropriately compensated?

Cat bonds have some attractive features. They can spread risks widely and
can be subdivided indefinitely, allowing each investor to bear only a small
part of the risk. The money backing up the insurance is paid in advance, so
there is no default risk to the insured.

As the market for cat bonds matures, secondary markets may develop,
particularly if the bonds become standardized and bundled into portfolios.
If so, the market price of cat bonds will reflect the market perceptions of
the likelihood of the event associated with the bond, just as price changes
on the orange juice futures market reflect the likelihood of a freeze in
Florida.

The market for cat bonds is still immature, and is only a fraction of the
size of traditional reinsurance. But cat bonds and other sorts of contingent
securities may well end up being part of the long-run solution to the
problems of the reinsurance industry.

ISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery
IFR - October 23, 2001

A UK lawyer retained by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
last Thursday advised that convertible bonds in their normal form meet the
""not-contingent"" clause of ISDA's standard credit derivatives definitions.

This cleared the way for banks to accept delivery of Railtrack's ?400m 2009
convertible under existing default swaps. Around ?75m of convertibles had
been delivered under default swap exercises by the close of trading on
Friday. Although banks and other protection sellers will now realise some
losses on acceptance of the Railtrack convertible, compared with accepting
Railtrack's straight debt, the advice from Robin Potts QC was welcomed by
the heads of credit derivatives at the major dealers.

The legal opinion in effect removes one of the last main uncertainties about
the enforceability of default swaps, and should allow increased sales of
credit derivatives to convertible bond buyers. ""The market has demonstrated
its maturity,"" said the head of credit derivatives trading at one bank. ""All
the major houses are now accepting convertibles as deliverables.""

A London-based lawyer was chosen to provide the advice because the UK is the
regime with the main legal question marks about deliverability of
convertible bonds under default swap contracts, as well as the home of
Railtrack. European convertibles typically feature a trustee with the
responsibility to exercise conversion rights if a stock price moves a
certain way beyond the strike price on a convertible bond.

Banks had worried that this ""widows and orphans"" feature of convertible
bonds could be interpreted to mean that the holder of a bond did not have
full rights over its disposal, and that the deal would not therefore be
deliverable under standard default swap language.

The finding that convertibles are not contingent, whether they have a
trustee or not, and therefore are deliverable under default swaps, unless
specified otherwise, brought the price of the convertible bond closer to
that of the cheapest to deliver of Railtrack's straight bonds, its S150m
2028 issue.

The convertible had been trading as low as 80 early last week, while the
2028 bond had been trading around 90. By the close of trading on Friday,
however, the convertible was priced at 84, bid only, while the 2028 bond was
at 87.75/88.5.

Assuming that default swap exercises were around these levels, the total
cost to protection sellers of the Potts opinion would have been roughly ?3m,
when comparing the cost of accepting ?75m of the convertible with delivery
of the straight bond. This cost will rise slightly, as the gap between the
prices of the convertible and the straight issue is likely to narrow further
before more exercises are completed.

Bank derivatives heads generally view the short-term cost as negligible
compared with the benefit of some assurance that convertibles are
deliverable. 

The advice from Potts does not carry the same weight as a court judgement,
but as the price of the convertible has appreciated, there is little chance
that an end investor in a synthetic securitisation or credit-linked note
will mount a legal challenge to try to stop a bank from accepting delivery
of the convertible.

The banks that arrange these structured trades normally have the
responsibility for handling any default swap exercises on the credits
included.  ISDA will soon unveil new detailed guidance on credit derivatives
written on convertible debt, including the zerocoupon bonds that have been a
major feature of issuance this year.

Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients 
Financial Times - October 23, 2001
By John Labate

JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are the latest firms to offer new derivatives
services to their clients.  The two investment banks are expected to
announce the first licensing agreements today with Longitude, a
Manhattan-based online derivatives platform that will also launch today. The
agreements give both firms exclusive licenses to offer derivatives trading
in a unique series of products. 

Derivative services allow companies and other institutions to offset the
risks that are inherent in a number of their investments or commercial
activities. Traditionally, the risks that have been hedged have been limited
to things traded already, such as stocks, bonds or currencies. 

Longitude was founded in 1999 and offers a service to run auction-based
hedging services for ""events of economic significance that cannot be hedged
currently in the derivatives markets"", according to chief executive Andrew
Lawrence. 

Mr Lawrence, a former hedge fund executive, says in its initial phase, the
company will offer JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank clients derivatives and risk
management services for economic statistics. In the near term, other
derivatives services will be launched through Longitude to hedge the
weather, equity prices, mortgage payments data, central bank target rates,
and to cover other areas. 

JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank did not state the amounts of their spending for
their licenses or the length of those contracts with Longitude. ""This
differentiates us as a provider of cutting-edge derivatives products,"" said
Chris Harvey, managing director at JP Morgan. ""There is no direct mechanism
in the capital markets for clients to take views or hedge exposure to
underlying economic variables."" 

Longitude's founders designed the system to simulate auction systems where
prices were set without the need to match buyers and sellers in the market.
The system is similar to betting that occurs at horse tracks, where the
prices are based on all ""bets"". Once the hedged event occurs, the many
separate claims are paid from the hedges placed in the system. 

Every cloud...?
FOW - October 2001

It would have been tempting, in 1997, to believe that the art of financial
risk management had reached a zenith. That was the year innovative energy
companies demonstrated that derivatives could be used to hedge the financial
impact of one of the most powerful and unpredictable variables confronting
business managers - Mother Nature.

According to the US Department of Commerce, at least $1 trillion of the US
economy is sensitive to the vagaries of the weather, including vast portions
of the energy, manufacturing, retailing, tourism and agriculture industries.
Yet it was only with the development of weather derivatives that companies
gained the ability to protect their financial results from significant but
non-catastrophic weather events such as excessive heat, precipitation or
wind risks that few traditional insurance policies could efficiently cover.
Today, it is clear that the trading of the world's first weather derivative
- a temperature collar executed between Koch Industries and Enron - marked
the dawn of a new era in risk management, not the crowning of an old one. It
signaled the creation of a trading market fundamentally more efficient than
insurance, which, after all, requires insurers to retain their clients' risk
and to charge a risk premium for providing that service. A trading market,
by contrast, matches principals on either side of a risk, eliminating the
need for a risk premium. The result is a less costly, more efficient means
of risk transfer.

Not surprisingly, companies whose financial results are sensitive to the
weather have been flocking to this new market. The cumulative notional value
of all weather derivatives executed since 1997 exceeds $7.5 billion.
Meanwhile, leading-edge traders are continuing to develop a seemingly
endless stream of new products that give companies the opportunity to hedge
all sorts of risks once considered unmanageable, from advertising costs to
river flows.

However, it is obvious that this new market still confronts numerous
challenges. Whole industries need to be educated in the use and value of
derivatives. Governments in the US and abroad must be shown that
market-oriented solutions to risk management can be more effective, and more
efficient for consumers, than regulatory solutions. (Some US regulators
still allow utilities to recoup the cost of bad weather from their
ratepayers through inefficient weather normalisation clauses, for example.)
In some regions of the world and some market niches, data for indices that
underlie these new products must become more rigorously standardised and
more widely available.

Despite these challenges, the opportunities are nearly limitless. The past
half-decade has shown that nearly any high-volume product, service or
business variable that can be measured can be commoditised, and that
anything that can be commoditised can be traded. 

Enron began proving this idea in 1989, when deregulation of the natural gas
industry was forcing companies to change the way they contracted for gas in
the wholesale market. That year, Enron executed the world's first
natural-gas swap to meet the needs of a customer that wanted to lock in a
fixed price for its gas purchases. To make the deal work, Enron agreed to
absorb the cost, or benefit, of monthly spot gas purchases tied to a
published index.

Five years after creating what would become the precursor to today's
wholesale gas trading business, Enron began migrating its gas trading
expertise into other markets, beginning with electrical power. In 1997, it
completed the world's first weather trade. Two years later, the company's
newly formed Enron Broadband Services unit debuted its Enron Intelligent
Network, an Internet application delivery platform, that later led to
Enron's first bandwidth trade. That year also marked the launch of
EnronOnline. There, companies can buy and sell a vast array of physical
commodities and related derivatives contracts in markets as diverse as
natural gas; power; emission allowances; bandwidth; weather derivatives;
NGLs, petrochemicals and plastics; coal; crude oil; pulp and paper; credit
derivatives; shipping; steel and metals.

However, the idea of hedging risk with derivatives is not a new one. As
early as the 12th century, vendors at European trade fairs were signing
contracts for future delivery of goods. Futures contracts were part of tulip
mania in Holland in the early 1600s. In that same century, the Japanese
created a futures market in rice at Dojima, near Osaka, to protect sellers
from bad weather or warfare. In 17868, the Chicago Board of Trade began
trading wheat, pork belly and copper futures. Today, the range of
commodities and risks that can be traded are limited only by imagination and
determination.

The weather market
A closer look at the development of the weather market illustrates the
opportunity. According to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and
the Weather Risk Management Association, the number of weather contracts
executed in the 12 months ended April 14, 2001 rose by 1150/0, to 2,759,
from the comparable year-earlier period. While the total notional value of
weather derivatives traded during that time declined 17%, to $2.5 billion,
the downturn appears to have been a consequence of happenstance - in this
case, mild temperatures during the winters of 1997, 1998 and 1999 in North
America, where more than 95% of all contracts were executed. Those temperate
winters, the survey managers theorise, likely caused buyers of
temperature-related weather derivatives to demand less protection against
the possibility of an unusually cold winter in 2000.

While temperature-related weather contracts remain, for the moment, the most
popular type of weather derivative, there are signs that the market is
broadening. While temperature-linked contracts accounted for 98.30/0 of all
contracts traded during the first three and-a-half years of the market's
development, for example, contracts linked to other measures accounted for
7.2% of all contracts written during the six months ended April 14, 2001.
We can expect this broadening of the market to continue as new products give
companies the power to more precisely hedge their risks. Prime examples
introduced recently include power demand swaps and cross-commodity options.

Demand swaps are designed to overcome one of the biggest pitfalls of weather
derivatives: they can protect companies against swings in demand -either for
the products they sell or the raw materials they consume - only to the
extent that demand is impacted by the weather. Demand swaps, by contrast,
protect companies from fluctuations in demand regardless of the cause,
making them a more flexible and in some cases more accurate hedging tool.

Power demand swaps allow companies that buy and sell electricity to lock-in
their demand or consumption exposure within a specified power pool in the
US. Suppose, for example, that a power aggregator serving customers in the
PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland) pool routinely buys its power in the
forward market. When demand exceeds the norm, the aggregator is forced to
purchase additional power in the open market, generally at inflated prices.
With demand swaps, the aggregator can receive payments from Enron when
weekly demand within its pool exceeds the average. In exchange, it would
agree to make payments to Enron when weekly demand is below average. When it
is required to make payouts, it can offset their cost in part by selling
some of its excess power back into the market. For utilities uncomfortable
with the open-ended cost of a swap, Enron also offers power demand options
that limit costs to the premium paid for the option.

Cross-commodity options protect companies against both price and volume
volatility simultaneously. Unlike a traditional weather derivative, which
pays out a specified amount of cash per unit of weather, these new contracts
pay out based on the difference between the market price of an underlying
commodity, such as energy, and a contracted strike price for that commodity.
The payout is still triggered, however, by a weather variable.

Here's a real-life example. In July, a Midwestern utility began searching
for protection against the adverse financial impact of a warmer than normal
winter. Per its custom, the utility wished to purchase its gas for the
upcoming winter in advance, via the futures market, and to lock in a
sufficient quantity to cover the coldest possible winter. The downside of
this strategy is that if the winter proves unseasonable mild, the utility
would be left with a long gas position in a soft market. Not only would the
utility sell less gas to its customers than anticipated, it would probably
have to sell gas back into the spot market at deflated prices.

Under the terms of a cross-commodity contract the utility entered into with
Enron, it will receive compensation if the number of heating degree days
(the cumulative number of degrees below 650F) from November through March is
below a predetermined strike. The amount of compensation is dependent upon
the market price of gas at the beginning of each month covered by the
contract. Enron, through what are effectively put options settled in cash,
will pay the utility the difference between the market price of gas that
month and a strike price equal to what the utility paid in the futures
market.

Growing global
While most weather derivatives have been traded in the US, they have already
begun to migrate overseas into Oslo, Tokyo, Sydney and London. Other
important players are entering the market, too. They include, most notably,
large financial institutions - Goldman Sachs in the US, Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank in Germany, and Credit Lyonnais in France. The importance of
their participation in this new market rests to a large degree on the
relationships they have with their clients - relationships founded in part
on trust. Because of that trust, companies already doing business with these
banks may be more receptive to entering what is, for most of them, a novel
marketplace. In addition, these banks can offer their clients incentives to
use weather derivatives in the form of reduced lending rates - a reward
reflecting the fact that users of weather derivatives generally enjoy
smoother, more predictable financial results than their competitors who do
not use them.

A final factor driving the growth of the weather derivatives market is the
increasing pressure companies are getting from lenders and investors to make
use of these instruments. Now that companies can control the financial
impact of adverse weather conditions, they are finding it increasingly hard
to justify any failure to do so.

"Sempra v. Enron","	In September I sent you all a summary of the facts at issue in the above-referenced lawsuit. Since that time, several developments have occurred.  First, the trial date was moved from October 11, 2001 to November 13, 2001.  We have no reason to believe that we will not go to trial on the 13th.  We expect the trial to last from 10 days to 2 weeks. Judge Ira Gammerman will try the case. There is no jury. 
	The second development deals with the proposed summary judgment motions mentioned in my last e-mail.  Summary judgments on liability and damages have been filed and the plaintiffs have responded.  We have filed replies to their opposition papers.  In addition, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability.  We filed opposition papers to this motion.  New York practice differs somewhat from Texas practice to the extent that we have no firm date for a hearing on these motions.  Although we are attempting to get a hearing before the trial date, the judge has complete discretion as to whether to hear the parties' motions for summary judgment before the start of trial.
	The third development relates to the plaintiffs' theory of the case. It seems clear from the papers filed in response to our motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs are fine-tuning their case to focus on the contracts' size distribution requirement arguing that the type of coal supplied by Enron, whether crushed or not, could never meet the contracts' size distribution requirement. The plaintiffs make this argument in simple terms and, when argued as such, it has some appeal. However, it is Enron's position that the contracts' language is ambiguous and the better (and much more complicated) approach advanced by the defendants is that the subject coal could and would have met the size distribution requirements. Issues of whether the contracts are installment contracts also play heavily in this analysis. 
	Fourth, since the last e-mail on this matter, we have learned that the plaintiffs are seeking $71 million in damages from Enron. This is approximately half of the amount of the contracts' damage cap. 
	Lastly, we finally received a response from the plaintiffs to the settlement proposal we made in June. The plaintiffs have offered to resolve this matter for a cash payment by Enron of $45 million. In the alternative, the plaintiffs have proposed a business alternative which is currently being investigated. Additionally, there is some discussion of mediation in the limited time remaining before trial.
	Should you have any questions about this case or should you need any further information, please call me.

Jeff / John,

We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watching our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to understand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. After your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you concur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sheet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please let us know.

Introduction

Enron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp.  EML is one of Enron's two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron's only remaining brokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to its clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the LME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulatory oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron's other businesses:
1)	EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulatory rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of business. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in disciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.

2)	By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumstances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML's policy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML's conduct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by the FSA and the LME.

3)	Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets and to protect against systemic risk, EML's position as a provider of liquidity and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or lack of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a consequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as position and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordance with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirement. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requirement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to cease carrying on business.

4)	EML's board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory oversight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members under the FSA's rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law relating to directors' duties.

Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation

In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to demonstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial strength of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by the rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.

Issues Surrounding Liquidity

As we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation problems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased the hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precaution against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to the non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accomplished within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron company as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was concerned  

The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML, it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory capital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its day to day liquidity. 
 
In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purposes.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collateral to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforcement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractual payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referred to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While there is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market profits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation questions.

Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenarios where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However certain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of losing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC's, which were primarily used in lieu of cash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC's.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML's cash balance.  Was the remaining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquidity impact.

The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need for being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have agreed to start to do the following
a.	Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquidity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to the rest of the enterprise
b.	Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel
c.	Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints of continuing to do business on a normal basis
d.	Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis
e.	Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so as to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity
f.	 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additional liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when our own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis

Operational Risk  

In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own accounts and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash needs.  EML's board have been resistant to this practice for several very practical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly call on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  If EML relied on Enron Corp.'s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an accounting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either capital or liquidity events as EML's clearing account at Citibank would be substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event might create a cascade for Enron, EML's board is reluctant to put that much faith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.

Capital

As noted above, EML is subject to the FSA's regulatory capital rules and must calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires that EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum financial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these violations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enforcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintains financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might arise from Enron's perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investigation of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in light of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EML's cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily basis, EML's board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital level of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and excess capital adequacy go hand in hand.  

Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing

The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of scenarios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML

1)	Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or external clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
2)	Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house account resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH
3)	Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME brokers
4)	Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the inability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in cash being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly 
5)	Credit exposures leading to credit losses

Recommendations

The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase overall operational liquidity

1)	To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm subordinated facility
2)	To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)
3)	To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturity by six months to July 2002
4)	To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profits and other assets held by EML
5)	To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshold for calling margin
6)	To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other than a select group of key relationship clients 
7)	To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading companies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory finance


Current Situation

Unsecured Guaranty			$65 mm
Secured Guaranty			$15 mm
Subordinated Loans			$107 mm
EML Cash Balance:			$59 mm
Cash required to replace
Withdrawn guaranty			($20mm)


EML Regulatory Capital Level:	128%
Excess Reg. Capital over 110%:	$30 mm

Conclusion

The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress testing.
The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we would have liquidity issues.  Given these possible eventualities we would urge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to completing point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

DJ Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal<ENE.N><MSFT.O>
   By Michael Rieke
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

    HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling
was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for
his company's foundering broadband business.

    Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth
for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron
would give more details on the deal later.

    After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence
by suing Microsoft.

    In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron
claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal.

    The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide
network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed
Internet service, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for
use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the
deal, according to the lawsuit.

    Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal,
so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal,
the lawsuit said.

December 5-7, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.

 

EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.

Electric Power Market Performance Conference

December 12-14, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.

 

A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.

 

Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

 Electric Risk Management 101 Workshop 

And

Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference

January 22-25, 2001, New York City, NY

OVERVIEW

 

In the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference

Feb. 6-7, 2002, Miami, Florida

OVERVIEW

This conference will examine the business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO initiatives.  The conference will review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and regional trading system.

Mark, 
re. the above, we are working on a significant number of divestments (very important transactions for cashflow reasons totalling potentially over 500MM US) in Europe that are likely triggers; I urgently need to address this with you guys - Michael Brown wants me to sort out a waiver letter / procedure before the weekend. Can't get a hold of Lance. Could you or Lance give me a shout this morning.

"","Dear Mark and Lance: 

        I know it's a challenging time over there right now for all of you, and that the last thing you want is another pitch.  However, I wanted to let you know that we're still thinking of you and eager to do whatever we can to assist in the transition process.  In that regard, several of us got together yesterday to meet and discuss areas where we could provide some assistance to Enron as it moves forward.  That list is as follows:

        Divestitures.  As you know, we certainly have a close familiarity with Enron's various businesses.  While it's presumably too early to know what Enron will keep and what it will dispose of, we are certainly well situated to assist in those transactions.  

        Restructurings.  We are also well-positioned to assist you in any debt restructurings which Enron chooses to pursue.  I will separately send you some additional information regarding our banking and lending practice, and loan restructuring practice.  

        Securities Litigation.  While I know Enron retained Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering for most of the securities litigation, we do have some unique capabilities in that regard, and would like to explore either serving as local counsel in some of that litigation, or representating some of the Enron affiliates that are named in the litigation.  Again, I will separately send some information regarding our securities litigation practice.

        Commercial Leasing.  I imagine that Enron's office space situation will change fairly dramatically.  We have extensive experience in leasing and subleasing matters, as well as real estate work-out matters.  

        Labor/Employment.  We can offer targeted and deep expertise in any aspect of labor and employment law that may be implicated in the Dynegy/Enron merger, from review and analysis of employment agreements that may exist with key Enron employees to assisting with any adjustment of the workforce of the combined companies.  I will send you more detailed information about our practice in this area.  

Mark and Lance, this list is intended merely as our best guess as to areas where Enron may need some assistance--it is not meant to be exhaustive.  We want to help you in any way that we can, whether it's in areas that we've discussed above, or in other areas that we haven't thought of.  The key point is that we are here to help.  Call me when you get some time and we can discuss this in more detail.  My direct line is (713) 226-1143.

Very truly yours, 

Bill

"Alberta PPA","Lisa,

I'm the commercial person responsible for the sale of the Alberta PPA.  I was looking for an update on where this issue is at.

It is my understanding that we need to have the bankruptcy court bless ENA's shareholders resolution for the sale of the PPA.  Have we applied to the court to hear this matter?  What does the prospective timing look like?  I'm assuming that you are the individual responsible for coordinating this effort.

We are in a situation here where collateral demands ($23.7MM) have been made on Enron Canada Power Corp. which are due on Tuesday, December 18.  ECPC does not have the capacity to post this collateral.  It is my fear that the counterparty demanding the collateral will petition ECPC into court protection upon non-compliance with the collateral demand.

Additionally,  it is unclear how any court proceeding with Enron Canada Corp. may affect both ECPC and the PPA.  It is my understanding that there may be some activity on this front early next week.

Either one of these issues may cause a default under the PPA.  At that point in time the Owner of the PPA is free to terminate.  If the PPA is terminated, the value of this asset would go to zero.  It is clear that the Owner of the PPA is itching to terminate and this would terminate the proposed sale to Altagas Services of $215 MM.

Could you please get back to me with some guidance on this issue.

"Goldman CA","Attached is a revised version of the CA with Goldman.  The remaining issue is in Section 1 regarding restrictions on Goldman's ""use"" of the Confidential Information.  Goldman believes that they will have to bring a lot of their personnel, including traders, ""over the wall"" in order to perform this engagement, and that such personnel will by necessity see some of our Confidential Information.  While they agree that their personnel shouldn't be able to use our specific information against us in future transactions, they are worried that the restriction on their use of our info that is set out in Section 1 could limit the future activities of those folks simply because they ""saw"" some of our Confidential Information and are carrying it around in their heads, and at any time could be accused of ""using"" our info.
 
Initially, Goldman insisted on removing the restriction on use. We have suggested the language at the end of Section , which would generally restrict use of the information to the engagement, but would allow Goldman's non-IB's to work on the deal but perform their other jobs without worrying about violating the CA as long as they weren't using the notes that they took while they were in our shop.  Admittedly, it is not as clean as I would like, but I think this adequately addresses both parties' concerns.
 
Goldman was initially receptive to this language, and will call tomorrow morning with any other comments.

Asset Sale Between TXU and EDF Supports European Strategies of Both Companies



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from PR Newswire] TXU Corp. (NYSE: TXU) has agreed to sell its 2,000 MW coal-fired West Burton power station, near Retford, Nottinghamshire, England, to London Electricity Group for GBP366 million (U.S. $523 million). In another transaction, TXU also announced the sale of Eastern Electricity, its U.K. distribution business, and its 50-percent interest in 24seven, the company that operates and maintains the distribution network, to London Electricity for GBP 1.31 billion (U.S. $1.873 billion). London Electricity, a distribution company that serves three million customers across Britain, is a subsidiary of Electricite de France (EDF), the state-owned and largest energy firm in France. London Electricity already owns the other 50 percent of 24seven. 

Analysis: It's rather rare that an asset sale equally benefits the two energy companies involved in the transaction, but that appears to be the case in this deal between TXU and EDF. Both companies are pursuing different strategies, but they share a common goal of gaining a leading position in their respective niches in the European market. The transfer of both TXU's generating station and the entire distribution business in the United Kingdom to the French conglomerate EDF should help both companies increase market share in their respective markets. The divestiture enables TXU to obtain its goal of accumulating a total of about $2 billion in available capital to grow its energy merchant business across Continental Europe. For EDF, which aims to gain 20 percent of the market in Britain, the sale solidifies the company's position as a leader in the distribution sector and also expands its generation assets (both through its London Electricity subsidiary). Although the deal appears to be a winning transaction for both companies, one stumbling block toward obtaining necessary regulatory approval is the lingering frustration over EDF's expansion in other countries while the French market remains comparatively restricted. 

Before moving on to the individual strategies of TXU and EDF, let's establish what is included in the current transactions. As noted, the sale of the generation assets includes only the coal-fired West Burton plant, for which London Electricity has also agreed to complete the installation of a flue gas desulphurization process. The transaction also includes a long-term contract for TXU to supply the station with coal. TXU Europe's distribution business is actually the largest in the United Kingdom, and includes the assets and wires that deliver electricity through a 56,000-mile network in East Anglia and southeast England. Both transactions must obtain regulatory approval from the European Union, and U.S. regulators may review the sales as well. 

Let's now look at the separate gains that the two companies make in these transactions. 

TXU Corp.
First, it is important to note that the European expansion of Dallas-based TXU Corp. is driven by the company's TXU Europe subsidiary. TXU's divestiture of its U.K. power assets is part of a larger strategy that the company has been pursuing for over a year. In a nutshell, TXU Corp. has sought to gain $2 billion from selling off non-strategic assets owned by TXU Europe to support further growth of the company's core trading and merchant energy businesses across the Continent. In February 2001, TXU Europe announced the sale of its gas-field assets in the North Sea to Consort Resources, which was the first indication that the company was moving away from a hard-asset strategy. TXU believes it only needs to have access to power supply through various contracts to retain its position as a leading power trader in Europe. Toward this end, TXU Europe also recently announced the sale of its 20-percent stake in Spain's Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico. In June, TXU completed the divestiture of its 1,000-MW Rugeley coal-fired power station to International Power. In August, TXU sold two gas-fired power plants in Eastern England, totaling 705 MW, to Centrica, a British gas and home services supplier, for $250 million. 

Under the current sale of its U.K. assets, TXU exits the regulated pipes and wires business in the United Kingdom and gains available capital to support further growth in its trading business across the Continent. Specifically, from both sales TXU reportedly will reach its total of $2 billion in available financial resources and substantially exceed its previously established GBP 1 billion debt-reduction target. In other words, proceeds from the sales reportedly will allow TXU to strengthen its financial position by reducing debt, and TXU says it expects to cut its net debt-to-capital ratio to 55 percent by early 2002. However, the sale of the distribution assets includes a one-time write-off of $150 million that TXU is taking associated with transaction and debt restructuring. The write-off has caused TXU to reduce its 2002 earnings by 39 cents a share. The company now expects to earn between $4.35 to $4.45 a share next year. 

With the divestiture proceeds in hand, TXU Europe's primary business model will remain focused on energy trading, a market in which the company holds a top-three position throughout the Continent. Further, the asset sales extricates TXU from the distribution sector, which it acknowledges is a business that provides lower returns and declining profitability. The bottom line for TXU in this and related sales is to ""recycle capital into the faster growing merchant energy business,"" in the words of TXU Europe's CEO, enabling the company to derive more than three-fourths of its subsequent proceeds from this business. It is important to note that TXU Europe includes generating, trading and retail operations under the larger umbrella of its energy merchant operations. TXU Europe will probably remain involved in Britain's retail market, where the company retains the power-supply contract to serve 5.5 million customers, but the company is no longer interested in the distribution sector of this market. 

Moreover, it is clear that energy trading is now the core of TXU's European operations. TXU Europe holds a trading volume of approximately 600 GWh, and earlier in 2001 the parent company TXU Corp. reported a 75-percent jump in its revenue that was attributed in large part to its energy trading business, both in Europe and the United States. TXU Europe still hopes to control physical assets in Europe, as represented by its purchase this year of a 51-percent state in Germany's Kiel utility, which in terms of volumes and customer base is the ninth largest of hundreds of municipalities in Germany. However, it is clear that TXU is moving out of the U.K. power distribution market and its sights are more clearly focused on Continental Europe. 

Upon the word that the sales would drag down its earnings growth for the next three years, TXU shares fell about 8.5 percent on Nov. 19 to close at $45.59. In early morning trading on Nov. 20, TXU shares were priced at $45.15. However, Wall Street analysts indicate that the sales should increase TXU's long-term attractions because it will presumably be pursuing other acquisitions enabled by these sales. 

Electricite de France
As noted, London Electricity is buying the generation and distribution assets from TXU, but it must be understood that these moves are being driven by the French-government owned Electricite de France, London's Electricity's parent company. EDF, which still maintains a practical monopoly status in France, purchased London Electricity in 1998 for 1.9 million British pounds ($2.72 billion) from Entergy Corp. Based on comments from EDF over the last year, the company plans on expanding its products and services and investing in further strategic alliances to become a multi-energy company. 

In fact, London Electricity acknowledges that the purchases are part of the company's strategy to consolidate its position within the United Kingdom. Thus, while the U.K. market no longer appears to be a core focus of TXU, it obviously holds appeal for other companies that are attempting to gain a market share in Europe. Upon completion of the transactions, EDF / London Electricity will increase its share of the U.K. generation market to 7.5 percent from 4.5 percent, and reduce the gap that currently exists between its market share of generation versus distribution in the United Kingdom. London Electricity already owns the Cottam power station, a 2,000-MW coal-fired generating plant located near the West Burton plant. However, London Electricity will still own far less generation capacity in the United Kingdom when compared to the market leaders Powergen (which controls 10,000 MW) and Innogy (which controls about 8,000 MW). 

Thus, the true focus of these purchases by London Electricity may be on the distribution sector. Upon completion of the transactions, London Electricity will own Britain's largest power distribution network and control about 18 percent of the country's distribution business. Analysts have suggested that EDF overpaid for TXU's West Burton plant (the buying price represented a 26-percent premium over the plant's book value), but got a fair price for the distribution assets. The point here may be that EDF was arguably willing to pay more for the generation assets as it already holds a solid lock on distribution in the United Kingdom and is attempting to expand further by gaining control over generation assets. Representatives from London Electricity have said that the company and its parent want to be one of the top five players in the United Kingdom, and have a goal of gaining 20 percent of market share in the region. London Electricity has been named as a contender for the U.K. supply company Seaboard, which current owner AEP plans to put for sale next year. Seaboard serves around two million customers in England (in the towns of Kent, Sussex and Surrey). 

The involvement in EDF in this U.K. expansion has added a renewed spark to an old debate, namely the growth of EDF into other European countries while competition in France remains comparatively restricted. In other words, EDF has been the target of intense criticism across Europe for the last several years as the governments of other countries and other power firms have argued that EDF has taken advantage of investments abroad while fiercely protecting its own turf. For instance, while Germany has opened 100 percent of its power market to competition, France has opted for a phased-in approach, opening a third each of its power and gas markets by February 2003 and August 2008, respectively. While France remains rather blocked, EDF has freely admitted that it plans to acquire other companies in England, Spain, Italy, and possibly the United States. This dichotomy may become a factor as the current transactions with TXU fall under review of the European Union.

	Gentlemen, I need your assistance in resolving some outstanding FCC issues.  We have a license in the name of Enron Communications which I have directed to Michelle Hicks for resolution.  However, there is a company by the name of Enron Puerto Rico, Enron Processing Properties (in Louisiana), Enron Methanol, and Louisiana Resources Company for which I have had no responses from attorneys handling the FCC audit.  Jim Derrick told me that he believed, with the exception of Enron Processing Properties that the above companies were or are under your direction. If so, could you please assign an attorney to work with me to straighten out the outstanding licenses?  If you know anything about Enron Processing Properties, I would appreciate any guidance that you could give me even if it is a hunch.

	Thanks.

Matthew,

Attached below is an update I sent to Paul Freeman regarding EBS data retention.
The most important point to make in relation to the current litigation is that we can only provide data backups as far back as March/April 2001 and email backups as far back as 2001,
EBS systems were administered by the EBS US IT team prior to these dates.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

EBS in Europe
Prior to March 2001 EBS Europe had a independent infrastructure that was located in EH but administered out of the US by Scott Abshire and team. 
The European IT team had no access to the EBS environment and as such were unable to backup the data.

During March 2001 all EH based EBS users were migrated to the CORP domain but retained access to their US based Notes email system. 
At this time, all data files located on the EBS data server were migrated to the European S: drive, all user data was migrated to their respective H: drives.
The users continued to use their US based email system.

From the start of July, 2001 these EBS users were then migrated from the US based EBS email system to our Exchange system.

Implications for EBS litigation:
European IT Ops can only provide backups of the user data from March/April 2001 and email data from August 2001
Backups from prior to these dates would be held in the US (if they exist)

All continuing EBS employees and employees who have been redeployed from EBS to other Enron business units have had their mailbox size restrictions removed (to prevent any loss of email data relevant to litigation)

do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente.
? 1? Para efeito do disposto neste artigo, considera-se efetiva a
transfer?ncia do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente, com a poss?vel
redu??o do fator de pondera??o a ele aplic?vel, quando:
I - o contrato estabelecer como eventos de cr?dito, no m?nimo, a ocorr?ncia
individual ou conjunta das situa??es previstas no art. 2?, inciso II;
II - o ativo subjacente for legalmente pass?vel de transfer?ncia, nos casos
em que o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito assim o preveja na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito;
III - a contraparte transferidora do risco n?o retiver risco de cr?dito sob
qualquer forma;
IV - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite o cancelamento unilateral
do contrato pela contraparte receptora do risco de cr?dito, exceto na
hip?tese do n?o pagamento pela contraparte transferidora da remunera??o
estabelecida no art. 1?, incisos I e II;
V - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite, ? contraparte receptora do
risco de cr?dito, o n?o cumprimento da obriga??o de efetuar prontamente o
pagamento do montante devido ? contraparte transferidora na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito.
? 2? O fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, a ser aplicado ao montante
de prote??o do ativo subjacente para fins de apura??o do PLE deve ser obtido
com base na seguinte f?rmula:
FP = (1 - F) x (PRP x 50)/PRA + [1- (PRP/PRA)] x FPA + F x FPA, onde:
FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo
subjacente;
PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);
PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);
FPA = Fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, relativo ao ativo
subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o
art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e
altera??es posteriores;
F = ""zero"" nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser contratado na mesma
moeda que o ativo subjacente;
F = 0,50 (cinq?enta cent?simos) nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser
contratado em outra moeda que n?o a do ativo subjacente.
? 3? A exposi??o ao risco do ativo subjacente que exceder o montante
de prote??o deve ser ponderada pelo seu fator original conforme a Tabela de
Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo
IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e altera??es posteriores.
? 4? Na hip?tese em que estipulada cl?usula relativa a valores ou
percentuais m?nimos de perda do ativo subjacente para que a recomposi??o,
total ou parcial, seja efetuada, deve ser comprovada parcela adicional de
PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.
Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do
ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.
Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco
garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em
esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco
decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele
aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele
aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es
financeiras, de informa??es contendo, pelo menos, os seguintes aspectos
relativos ?s opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito:

mercado), total e no per?odo;
IV - receitas e/ou despesas no per?odo;
V - efeito (aumento/redu??o) no c?lculo do PLE;
VI - montante e caracter?sticas das opera??es de cr?ditos
transferidas ou recebidas no per?odo em decorr?ncia dos fatos geradores
previstos no contrato;
VII - segrega??o por tipo (swap de cr?dito e swap de taxa de retorno total).
Art. 6? O Banco Central do Brasil poder? determinar o aumento do PLE, com
base em caracter?sticas intr?nsecas ao contrato.
Art. 7? As institui??es devem manter, ? disposi??o do Banco Central
do Brasil, adequadamente documentadas, sua pol?tica e procedimentos para
realiza??o de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, bem como os limites de
exposi??o estabelecidos, independentemente da condi??o de receptora ou
transferidora do risco.
Art. 8? Fica condicionada ? autoriza??o do Banco Central do Brasil a
celebra??o de contrato de derivativo de cr?dito cujo montante seja igual ou
superior a 10% (dez por cento) valor do Patrim?nio de Refer?ncia (PR) da
institui??o que atuar como contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 9? A institui??o deve informar ao Departamento de Cadastro e
Informa??es do Sistema financeiro (Decad) o nome do diretor respons?vel pela
pr?tica de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, nos termos do art. 3? da

Enron Continues to Implode; 
Will the Dynegy Deal Proceed?



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis






[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) shares fell sharply in opening trade on Nov. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned it could be forced to pay by next week $690 million in debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week. The shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, to just over $7.00 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the second-most active stock on the NYSE. As of early morning trading on Nov. 21, Enron shares were priced at $4.85, reportedly their lowest level in nearly 10 years. 

Analysis: To paraphrase Shakespeare, ""Oh, what a tangled web they weave when first they attempt to?"" Wait, I better stop. When speaking about Enron, I am not prepared to finish that sentence, at least at this point. Enron has been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks, but at this juncture an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation has yet to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the part of the Houston trader. Enron itself has admitted that its financial records from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon."" Nevertheless, perception is reality and the perception currently in the industry is that Enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following years of skirting the truth. While negative perception continues to cause damage to Enron's stock, perhaps of more current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality. We know Enron has just lowered its third-quarter earnings, faces a stiff payment of $690 million (due within a week, in fact) and has cast doubt over its 4Q earnings potential. The question of the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a ""material adverse change"" in the eyes of Dynegy, which still aims to buy Enron but wisely included an exit clause in its purchase contract. The other question is, what happens to Enron if Dynegy leaves it standing at the altar? A terminated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to Enron's already-weak credit standing, and it is unknown how the company could recover from another blow to its reputation. 

As has been the case since the first of October, the ongoing ""fall of Enron"" story is changing by the day. For background on Dynegy's proposed acquisition of Enron, and Enron's financial problems that precipitated the proposal, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAlert (available at www.scientech.com/rci <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=987>). In the interest of time, let me summarize what is happening at this moment. Dynegy rode in as Enron's white knight and plopped down a $9-billion offer ($10 a share) to buy the company, which at the time represented a steal of a price considering that Enron was priced at almost $90 a share little more than a year ago. To some extent, this seemed like the final chapter in the Enron saga. In other words, the company had gone through a tumultuous year, hit its ""rock bottom"" but still planned to live happily ever after as part of Dynegy, Inc., its much-smaller rival. 

The developments just this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fact interrupt the nuptials between the two companies. For starters, on Monday (Nov. 19), Enron submitted its 10-Q report to the SEC (which was five days late, by the way). In the report, Enron dropped what have turned out to be several bombshells. First, Enron disclosed that, due to recent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, it has to pay off or refinance by Nov. 26 debt it owes to a third party with which it has a partnership, or face nearly $4 billion in additional payments. Enron also has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt. Enron would not disclose who owns the note, but we know that the limited partnership includes holdings in C.E.G. Rio, a Brazilian natural gas-company that Enron had planned to sell to raise about $250 million in cash. Note that just last week, various credit services lowered Enron's senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned that further downgrades may occur, which apparently prompted the call for the debt payment. Reportedly, if Enron does not make the $690-million payment by Nov. 27, investors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for an amount equal to the note payable. Enron is presently scrambling to establish a ""mutually acceptable"" amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt. Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent payment of $690 million, Enron said that any further drop in its credit rating might necessitate further payments of $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of that figure going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust. 

Also in the new SEC filing, Enron increased its 3Q 2001 loss by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. Enron originally reported a 3Q loss of $618 million, but has now raised that figure to $664 million. As a minor bright side, Enron did increase reported earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by a penny to 20 cents a share, attributed to adjustments made after the quarter's end. However, looking forward, Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further toll on fourth-quarter earnings. Enron also claims that, even still, the numbers contained in the 10-Q report are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Andersen, the company's external auditor. Thus, further revision of the numbers could take place. 

Interestingly, there does not seem to be a big question about whether or not Enron can pay the $690-million debt obligation. Enron apparently has secured an additional $2 billion in loans from J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup in the last week. In fact, within the current SEC filing, Enron says that is has $1.2 billion of domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and net collections. Thus, some investors are reassured by the belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the $690-million payment if it is unable to renegotiate terms with lenders. According to the SEC filing, Enron also intends to sell off $8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ""below acceptable rates"" and would use the proceeds to pay off debts, although this money would probably not be immediately available. 

Again, however, there is a perception element to this development that should be noted. Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past in such a way as to keep them off the company's balance sheets. Apparently, this non-disclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without adding too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock. As has been well documented, Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC investigation regarding potential conflict-of-issues involving its former CFO. News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nervous about Enron's stock. 

As I said, the question of the hour is whether or not Enron's new problems will cause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As usual, the answer all depends on who you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enron's financial status to Enron. Investors are rather mixed on the question. Some say that the facts disclosed in the 10-Q report do not dramatically change Enron's position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisition and that the current drop in Enron's stock is just a knee-jerk response to the media hype surrounding the story. Further, those who diminish any potential impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money coming in from various sources. Thus, it should have no trouble making the $690-million payment. From a broad perspective, so one theory goes, Dynegy is still getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock price, and the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combined company as North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. 

In contrast, other investors point to the fact that since the purchase agreement was signed, Enron's stock has fallen an additional 32.5 percent, which weakens the original acquisition agreement. In addition, if Enron follows through with the $690-million payment next week or secures additional financing to front this cost, both options alter the company's financial position from when Dynegy made its original offer, which could be construed as a ""material adverse change."" 

Another interesting development indicates that Enron may no longer be the company that Dynegy agreed to purchase. New reports indicate many energy trading companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the company's credit concerns. Such companies are now particularly reticent to sell power to Enron for next-day delivery. What this means in practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining Enron's market share, which could diminish the value in the trading market that had attracted Dynegy to Enron in the first place. In addition, Enron's once-stellar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse altogether. 

Questions have been raised why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to help Enron out of its financial mess. Of course, under the acquisition agreement Dynegy already committed to providing an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equity infusion into Enron to help the company with its current financial woes, which will be followed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined company by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy. However, some traders apparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done anything about Enron's diminishing ability to secure power on the open market. Traders claim that Dynegy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron, in a strategy known as ""sleeving."" The fact that Dynegy has not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some observers that it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of Enron. 

In addition, Enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger with Dynegy from happening. The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consideration of other alternatives. Enron said it will defend its decision in court. 

Moreover, Dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisition agreement. The clause reportedly allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the SEC investigation, possible litigation against Enron, balance sheet strengths, and earnings forecasts. Certainly the latest developments disclosed in Enron's 10-Q filing with the SEC impact the company's balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts, so a case could be made that Dynegy would have grounds to terminate the acquisition. Clearly, this pending deal hinges on the developments that will take place over the next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for Enron and determine if the once-golden company still represents a great deal, or if pursuing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth.

Subject: dynergy planned for merger to fail all along


I'm not sure to whom I should tell this information.
 
While at an appointment on Friday afternoon, one person I met with told me hearsay, that he had heard from Dynergy employees that Dynergy had never had any intention of the merger succeeding, that the plan from the start was to get Enron's gas pipelines.
 
Given Enron's suit against Dynergy, I assume this is important to know.  If need be, I can tell you the name of the person who told me this, but I cannot vouch for what they said.

FirstEnergy and GPU Close Merger



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis


[News item from PR Newswire] FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) closed its merger with GPU Inc. on Nov. 6 and announced that members of its Board of Directors had been named. The effective date of the merger is Nov. 7, 2001. ""With today's closing of our merger, we will begin operating as a larger, stronger company, better positioned to provide significant benefits to our customers, shareholders and employees,"" said FirstEnergy Chief Executive Officer H. Peter Burg.

Analysis: When compared to 2000 and 1999, 2001 has turned out to be a rather anti-climatic year with regard to merger and acquisition activity in the energy industry. In fact, when compared to the early days of deregulation, M&A activity has slowed from a flood to a slow drip. The days of combining two vertically integrated utility companies to gain scale and guarantee survival appear to be on the decline. Partnerships will still continue, of course, but they are now of a different breed than before and have become far more focused on a particular market niche. One exception to the rather uneventful M&A scoreboard this year is the just-completed $4.2-billion partnership between FirstEnergy and GPU, which reportedly will create an electric utility serving 4.2 million customers from Toledo, Ohio to the New Jersey shore. The two companies have positioned their partnership as creating the ""premier supplier in a 13-state region."" However, while one of the few interesting deals this year, the FirstEnergy / GPU partnership has not been without controversy, especially with regard to lingering financial obligations that GPU has in the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. 

First, let's establish the basics about this partnership. Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy has purchased Morristown, N.J.-based GPU Inc., paying a dividend of $0.42392 a share that will be payable on Nov. 28. FirstEnergy-itself a product of a 1997 merger between Ohio Edison and Centerior Inc. -is already an energy services holding company serving 2.2 million customers within 13,200 square miles of northern and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania. FirstEnergy also provides natural-gas service to approximately 50,000 customers in the Midwest and is involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, and the transmission and marketing of natural gas, with resources that include proven reserves of 450 billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas and oil-about 90 percent natural gas-and approximately 5,000 miles of pipelines. FirstEnergy also owns 7,500 miles of transmission lines, with 35 interconnections in 6 electric systems, and is a member of the Alliance RTO. FirstEnergy has a market capitalization of $8.1 billion, a P/E ratio of 12.99, and its shares currently are priced at $35.72. 

GPU Inc. is an international provider of energy-related infrastructure and services. Domestically, its three electric utility subsidiaries-doing business as GPU Energy-serve two million customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Through the GPU International Group, GPU develops, owns and operates transmission and distribution facilities overseas. GPU has a market capitalization of $4.8 billion, a P/E ratio of 10.51, and on its last day of trading (Nov. 6) its shares were priced at $40.39.

From its inception, the primary objective of this acquisition was to enable FirstEnergy to become the premier regional energy and related services provider in the northeastern quadrant of the United States. A key part of this strategy is the expansion of the combined company's unregulated marketing opportunities, including the acceleration of a retail business that FirstEnergy gains by buying GPU.

After Nov. 7, FirstEnergy will begin operating as a registered holding company with seven electric utility operating companies-Ohio Edison, The Illuminating Company, Toledo Edison, Metropolitan Edison, Pennsylvania Electric, Pennsylvania Power, and Jersey Power & Light-which reportedly will comprise the fourth-largest investor-owned electric system in the United States, based on amount of customers. As noted the combined company has billed itself as the premier supplier in a 13-state region. Those 13 states are New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. However, it is clear that, among these 13 states, the combined company has already established a particularly strong business in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, where it will maintain a geographic presence of 23 percent, 28 percent and 49 percent, respectively. 

According to a presentation made by CEO Peter Burg earlier this year, the acquisition of GPU Inc. will ""optimize FirstEnergy's generation portfolio,"" by, among other things, increasing its customer load and the utilization of its baseload units. Prior to the acquisition, FirstEnergy operated 16 power plants with a total system capacity of nearly 13,000 MW. Out of this total generating capacity, 58 percent (7,471 MW) is produced using coal; 29 percent (3,779 MW) comes from nuclear plants; 10 percent (1,273 MW) is fueled by natural gas or oil; and 3 percent (435 MW) comes from pumped-storage hydroelectric facilities. Through the acquisition of GPU, FirstEnergy reportedly will gain 1,155 MW in peaking generation and the opportunity for over 800 MW of capacity releases. Company information indicates that FirstEnergy produced nearly 70 million MWh of electricity over the last year. 

As noted, while the partnership between FirstEnergy and GPU is for the most part quite synergistic and has obtained its necessary regulatory approvals in a comparatively smooth fashion, the deal has not been completely without controversy. For instance, a Pittsburgh-based consumer group known as Citizen Power has expressed concern that the partnership will ultimately prove harmful for consumers of the combined company. Specifically, the group claims that FirstEnergy customers have already been paying $9 billion in stranded costs and could be forced to pay for additional charges associated with GPU's partial ownership of the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant. Despite the fact that the merger is now officially completed, Citizen Power reportedly has asked a Pennsylvania court to require state energy regulators in that state to reverse the approval of the merger. One of the group's arguments is that the Pennsylvania PUC did not require either FirstEnergy or GPU to demonstrate how the merger would benefit or otherwise impact the public and did not seek approval from the groups involved in GPU's restructuring agreement with the state. Other groups in Ohio have similar frustrations with the PUC in that state and are concerned about any increases in FirstEnergy rates that may occur as a result of payments that GPU is still making toward Three Mile Island. 

There is some public confusion surrounding GPU's holdings in Three Mile Island, which can be easily clarified. There are two nuclear units at the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant, Units 1 and 2. In late 1999, GPU sold TMI-1 to AmerGen Energy, the joint venture between PECO Energy and British Energy Co., for $100 million, which was about one-sixth of the book value for the unit. The ownership of the plant known as TMI-2 has remained with GPU. In 1979, TMI-2 was the site of the nation's worst nuclear accident, in which nearly half the uranium core melted. The TMI-2 unit is essentially dead and has not functioned since 1979. However, GPU has continued to keep the plant in a state of ""monitored storage,"" and has encountered some expenses related to staff, etc., which continue to monitor the unit. The concern from some consumers, whether it is valid or not, is that FirstEnergy, which now owns TMI-2 due to its acquisition of GPU, will be picking up any residual expenses related to this unit. Specifically, TMI-2 is not scheduled to be decommissioned until 2014 at the earliest, and there may be some cleanup costs associated with the decommissioning that may exceed current estimates.

It is important to note that GPU has very little of its own generation assets. The company has followed a revised strategy over the last year that included the exit of the merchant energy business and a clear focus on the transmission and distribution sectors of the industry, as well as new non-regulated businesses. Another pending acquisition of some remaining GPU assets involves UtiliCorp's $2.1 billion offer for Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity, which reportedly is the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom. This deal should move forward, although it was contingent on the completion of FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU. FirstEnergy had previously established that it had no interest in retaining GPU's international assets, which include small holdings in Great Britain, Australia and South America. In addition, the offer makes sense for FirstEnergy, because it provides the company with available capital to pay down acquisition debt and possibly fund additional acquisitions. 

Moreover, FirstEnergy executives believe any possible negatives in its acquisition of GPU are outweighed by the positives. Again, the fundamental benefit of the FirstEnergy / GPU partnership is that it should create one of the leading-if not the leading-electric providers in a stretch of territory from Ohio to New Jersey. FirstEnergy gains significantly in the deal by acquiring GPU's customer base and the ability to optimize its own existing and growing generation arsenal. Plus, FirstEnergy also gains GPU's remaining generation capacity, which is rather minimal but does include about 1,155 MW in peaking generation. From a broad perspective, FirstEnergy and GPU have followed through with a rather smooth merger process, which certainly represents an atypical development against a landscape of terminated consolidated deals this year. 

UPDATE ON SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE: See the 11/6/01 IssueAlert  <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=979>for a full description of Measures F and I that appeared on the ballot in San Francisco and Brisbane, Calif., in yesterday's election. Both measures related to municipalizing the electric system currently owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. According to data obtained from the San Francisco Department of Elections as of early morning on Nov. 7, voter turnout in the area was 25.16 percent. Measure F, which would create a Municipal Water & Power Agency in San Francisco only, passed by a very slim margin of 56,008 votes (51.02 percent) to 53,760 votes (48.98). The passage of this measure will create a new agency in the city of San Francisco (not a municipal utility district) that will not include the city of Brisbane. The agency will be governed by an elected seven-member board of directors and reportedly will replace the current jurisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission. 

Measure I, which would have created a Municipal Utility District (MUD) in both San Francisco and Brisbane, did not pass. However, it was defeated by a very slim margin of 53,865 votes (50.63 percent) to 52,524 votes (49.37 percent). 

It is not presently clear whether or not all of the absentee votes have been calculated in this election, and thus there is a good chance that the above tally may change in the next few days and could possibly alter the outcome of this election. 

While Pacific Gas & Electric Co. put a positive spin on the election results in a press release that is circulating today, the fact of the matter is that this was a very close election. While the city of Brisbane shot down the idea of a MUD, San Francisco is proceeding with a Municipal Water & Power Agency, which at some point may also attempt to seize the transmission and distribution assets of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Without question, the public power debate in this area is far from over and in many ways has received a boost from this election. I will continue to follow the story and provide further updates that occur from regional analysis.

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times 



By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President 


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/rbellrgb100border.jpg>

Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday in response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' projections, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing its ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone ahead. 

Analysis: Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent since May 1, 2001. But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts. Earlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Company, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market conditions improve. 

The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same forces. Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons for dropping its company-separation plans. The company said it would now focus on using its ""single"" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United States. ""What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that comes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) is the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound. The world has changed,'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference call with the media. 

The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly. The company will pay Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreement, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $196 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business continued. Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cause the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quarter. The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. Goldman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy trading and marketing business. In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryland deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a separate trading company. Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain together.

It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other significant announcements concerning its future plans. Mayo A. Shattuck III was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001. Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Banc. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the past seven years. On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said it would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million. Constellation Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group. As part of the sale, Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nine Mile 1 is not extended. 

The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bulk of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny. Constellation's domestic merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per share of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share in earnings for the same quarter. Allegheny Energy reported that their third-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the acquisition of a trading and marketing unit. Allegheny's third-quarter earnings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share. Allegheny is confident that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 to $4.10 per share. 

Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 percent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days. The drop in energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power prices. Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny's 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price assumptions. 

The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be over. Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and softening wholesale market prices. Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry: ""One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth."" 

AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees. Its earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets. AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of flat growth. Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their product. But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one year ago in many parts of the country. 

The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fundamental shift in the electric business. Their actions are, in some respects, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliability in their power supply costs, profits and operations. Perhaps most significantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to whether or not they will continue to be an integrated business. As Constellation concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business is to remain an integrated company. We would not be surprised if others come to the same conclusion.

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

"Issuance of Letters of Credit","Jordan, in response to your questions concerning the issuance of letters of credit starting today, I think that the response needs to address two situations: the committed lc facilities [Chase and West LB] and the uncommitted facilities.

Since the uncommitted facilities involve minimal representations, they are not typically an issue [although we still need to review each circumstance individually], and unless there is a specific representation to Enron Corp.'s audited financials for the period 97-00 being prepared in accordance with GAAP, we should be able to issue letters of credit from an uncommitted facility.

However, sections 4.1(d) of each of  the West LB Facility and the Chase Facility contain a representation that Enron Corp.'s financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. This representation was false when made, and will always be false. Thus, there is an issue with an officer being able to make the representations and warranties necessary for an issuance of a letter of credit under one of these facilities [or for an extension of an existing letter of credit]. 

In order to utilize the committed facilities, it will be necessary to obtain an amendment or waiver of this representation, since simply adjusting the representation on an officer's certificate gives the agent a defense to issuance on the face of the certificate. [An amendment is preferable from Enron's perspective.] [Note that as we previously discussed, there is not an event of default under the facilities, since that provision has a materiality qualifier.]

Subject:  RE: Bank of England Application


bob,
i am a supporter.  in our dealings we see the bank as a growing user of
derivatives and feel comfortable with the separation from the FSA.  the new
role the bank plays is more akin to what some of the other central banks in
europe do rather than the fed or boj.

Subject: Bank of England Application


Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received
an
application from the Bank of England for subscriber membership. When we
have
considered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,
consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives
activities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likely
to obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we have
generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark
and Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We have
even
admitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, we
let them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDA
materials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that there
may be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.

In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been
expressed
if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for
membership.
These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the
regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to
influence the process.

Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of
England has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority has
correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional
central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market
and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.

In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previously
expressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on the
application of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from the
Hong
Kong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not received
an application.

Please share your views with the other members of the Board.

Bob

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.
