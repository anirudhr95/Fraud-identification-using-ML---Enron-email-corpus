We had a glorious morning of golf at the Fazio and then rushed to the
Traverse City airport, made the puddle jumper to O'Hare and had the
flight to Houston cancelled due to mechanical problems. We may get into
Houston by 10:00 tonight if we're lucky.  Captain Pear and I just
decided no more trips that involve connections. I hope you guys had
better luck. We really enjoyed the trip and look forward to a game in
Houston soon to check progress. Talk to you soon.

Subject:	SF Giants / California AG's Office Communication

David Tagliarino, Enron Sports Marketing Group, received a call today from John Yee, CFO of the SF Giants.  David, John and I got back on the phone this morning.  Following is a summary of our discussion:

John Yee, CFO, SF Giants, received a letter from the CA AG's office requesting their cooperation in an ""....investigation concerning Enron...."".  (John will fax that letter to me and I will circulate it)
John called the AG's office per their request in the letter received
The AG's office was digging for a bunch of information:
total MWH consumed
contract start date
term of contract
general questions about T's & C's
whether Enron had cancelled the contract
who was supplying electricity
copies of the agreements and letters of communication from Enron to the SF Giants
John was generally responsive and indicated that Enron has been great, has honored its contract, still has a contract in place, etc.
John pushed back on supplying any more information without a written request from the AG's office, and then also indicated that they would only supply what was required by law
The AG's office responded by indicating that they may have to subpoena the Giants
John will wait and see what the AG's office does
He will keep us in the communication loop and make sure that we have copies of the communication from the AG's office

Thanks - Dan

Mark-I met with you a couple of weeks ago regarding the legal position for the new freight group. After we met, I visited with Dan Reck (I had already met with Shawn Cumberland). I am very interested in the position and in Enron. I think my general corporate experience and my specific experience in freight forwarding from having been with Eagle Global Logistics readily adapts to the position.  I am used to a fast pace in a changing corporate environment. For your convenience, I have attached a slightly revised copy of my resume.

I would like to personally thank everyone that was involved in the sales process.  This transaction went very smoothly and I received several compliments from our counterparty regarding our professionalism on this deal.

Please take all post-closing actions that are required to finally consummate the conveyance and also be aware that the Purchase and Sale Agreement requires us to keep any and all data or information regarding the project and the transaction confidential for a period of two years.  In order to comply with the foregoing provision, I would strongly suggest that conversations regarding this transaction be limited to only those Enron employees who have a ""need to know.""

Subject: Strategic Planning 2002 and Other Upcoming Dates


We discussed at the Kyoto session the dates for the strategic planning
session next year and agreed on the last week in May 2002. The specific days
would be Wednesday, May 29, to Friday, May 31. We will go back to our
typical strategic planning schedule of gathering on Wednesday evening for
dinner, a full day on Thursday (meeting, activity and dinner) and a half-day
on Friday, ending with lunch. This is the week of Memorial Day in the U.S.
and Monday bank holiday in other countries, but the timing of the schedule
should mean that people would not need to travel on the Monday and, in most
cases, could travel on Wednesday.
 
As for location, we have made arrangements with the Ritz Carlton Resort in
Palm Beach, Florida. The resort is a smaller Ritz Carlton property and is
one of the top U.S. resorts according to a number of travel publications.
The website is
http://www.ritzcarlton.com/html_prop/resort.asp?Property_ID=13
<http://www.ritzcarlton.com/html_prop/resort.asp?Property_ID=13&PageNo=9>
&PageNo=9. Additional information on the resort will be in the September
board book. 
 
Domestic flights to Palm Beach are plentiful and there are a number of
international flights to Palm Beach (very near), Ft. Lauderdale (near) and
Miami (1-1/2 hours away). There are many activities of different sorts
(recreational and cultural (yes, even in Florida!)) nearby.
 
For your information, the schedule for upcoming Board meetings is as
follows:
 
Thursday, Sept. 13            London (tentatively at Deutsche Bank)
Tuesday, Nov. 13               New York (location tbd)
Thursday, Jan. 17              City and location tbd
Wed.-Thurs., April 17-18    Berlin, Intercontinental Hotel (AGM)
Wed.-Fri., May 29-31        Palm Beach, Ritz Carlton Resort
 
You may also wish to note our member update schedule in September and
October. Board attendance at these sessions is encouraged, particularly for
the Tokyo and Hong Kong updates since they are our principal events for the
year in those regions. If your schedule permits, please join us for all or
any part of the day. I would be happy to provide further details.
 
Wed., Sept. 12        London, One Whitehall Place
Thurs., Sept. 20       New York, Windows on the World
Mon., Oct. 15          Hong Kong, Conrad International Hotel
Thurs., Oct. 18        Tokyo, Royal Park Hotel
 
I hope your summer is going well.
 
Bob

Subject: GE Legal Department


Mark:  I caught up with Henry Hubschman, the President of the GE Aircraft Leasing subsidiary, last week.  He spoke to Ben Heineman who said he would be happy to discuss with you some of the issues you mentioned concerning the management and organization of GE's legal department.  Ben told Henry that he was just heading out on vacation for a good portion of August (apparently, this is the practice for most of the GE senior executives since Welch has historically done the same thing for most of August), so he suggested touching base in early September. If you want, I could follow up around that time and then get back to you. As I noted in one of my prior e-mails, Henry thought you may want to also touch base on these types of issues with the Chief GE Transactional Counsel (and/or the Chief Litigation Counsel) and, if you wish to do that, Henry said he would be glad to make contact with either or both of them for you.

I hope that you are doing well, and I'll be in touch.  Thanks.  John

Subject:	360networks conference call

Raj Thapar asked that I provide you with a report on the conference call held at 3:00 p.m. today with representatives of 360networks regarding our proposed settlement.

The primary participants in the call on 360networks' side were commercial people charged with responsibility for various aspects of the proposed settlement. There are a fair number of details to track, and the commercial team at 360networks has experienced virtually 100% turnover. The focus of the discussion was simply to ascertain whether the commercial counterparts were of one mind about the intended outcomes with respect to route cancellations, calculations of payments due, details of collocation requirements going forward and similar commercial details.

The 360networks team raised a number of questions regarding the types of questions described above. Some were addressed on the call, but the primary thrust was identification of the outstanding commercial issues for 360 (none of which seemed to be major) and the identification of the members of each commercial team responsible for each detail, so that we can break into working groups each of which can solve for a particular type of problem. A subsequent conference call will be necessary to gather the reports of the participants and to resolve any remaining issues.

Tim Aschoff, in-house counsel at 360, indicated that he was still awaiting comments from their outside counsel at Willkie Farr with respect to the settlement documents, and that those would be forwarded as soon as they become available. 

Tim Aschoff also emphasized that the deal was still of interest to 360, that the questions and issues being raised were not an attempt to re-trade anything, and that 360 regrets the delays and the confusion resulting from the turnover of its commercial team.

If anyone has any questions regarding the details of this call or the status of settlement negotiations, please feel free to call me.

As you know, ENA PDX is using the PGE Meridian Centrex Phones and Mer Mail voice mail system.  As a result of this email, I have contacted PGE Telephony services to evaluate our ability to comply.  

We, ENA PDX and PGE, already have a couple of questions:

Is PGE subject to this policy?
If for some reason the existing system keeps us, ENA PDX, from being able to comply, what are our options.
Is the phone system we have ordered (and its voicemail system), able to meet these needs without modification to the order. 

I am sure that other questions will come up, and I will communicate back to you what PGE finds				.

Please get back to me with thoughts.

Hello Mark: 

That is a great article in this month's Corporate Legal Times on the Enron legal department.  I know that the wholesale group has been critical to the company, and your role has been critical to the success of the legal department. 

Thanks for looking to Milbank on PG&E and EBS this year, among other things. 

In order to review where we are, and what we ought to be doing to better service your group, I would like to arrange a meeting with you at your convenience.  To suggest dates: do any of 10/19. 10/26, 11/2 or 11/8 work for lunch or an afternoon meeting?

Hope to hear from you soon.

Some of what follows may be old news or otherwise outdated, but as I try to get up the learning curve w/r/t our efforts regarding asset dispositions, I thought it may be helpful to summarize some items that I would think could be extremely helpful in the organization of our commercial and legal actions.  I recognize that there is no ""one template fits all""; nevertheless,  it would be extremely helpful if we already have or are otherwise organizing the following:

(1) Forms of CAs, LOUs/MOUs, PSA Agreements, and other relevant M&A docs;
(2) Matrix-type organization for every asset/business/investment that is ""for sale"" providing for the following:
   (a) Asset description and location;
   (b) Ownership of asset, including ownership schematics;
   (c) Book value of asset; estimated market value--and support for such; relevant financial information;
   (d) Likely purchasers;
   (e) Restrictions on transferability, including tax issues, consents, regulatory approvals, financings, etc.
   (f) Lead commercial contact;
   (g) In-house legal support, accounting support, tax support;
   (h) Outside counsel (U.S. and local, where appropriate);
   (i)  Outside advisors (investment bank, etc) and their counsel;
   (j) Status report and likely (realistic) timeframe; and
   (k) Other

If any of you can advise me whether we already have these items in place or, if not, your suggestions in this regard, I would very much appreciate it.

All,

We had a preliminary meeting on Friday.  The attached is a summary of the matrix we developed as well as changes from subsequent e-mails.  Note, only one name has been placed in the matrix where two may have been suggested - if the name is not correct then please e-mail me back as soon as possible - only person per box please.  The names placed in the matrix will be directly responsible to the estate.

We need to meet Monday to: (1) agree on the matrix; (2) develop detailed processes for capturing value (trade books, structured deals, hard assets and business sales); (3) understand the approval process required on a go forward basis; (4) develop compensation / retention program for estate, (5) address any administrative concerns.

If you have not done so, please check the names in the matrix to ensure that they are correct and please send me any changes as well as their full names to be utilized for future e-mails.

Regards,

Jim

Has anyone begun to address the issues surrounding the EEI product definitions and the new rules associated with ""transporting"" power across the new RTO/ISO control areas? Upon discussions with parties involved with the Midwest ISO (""MISO"") when scheduling power through the MISO control area a party will no longer designate an interface but only a source and a sink and the Control Area will determine the best path through its system. How will this affect the obligations of the products as defined under EEI. In particular how will this affect the ""Into"" product definition if the buyer and seller no longer have the ability to select an Interface?

Mike/Sarah,

California Penal Code Sections 631 and 632 make it a misdemeanor to record a telephone conversation without the consent of all the parties.  In addition, civil penalties are available in the amount of $5,000 per violation.  This is true whether the caller is in California or some other state.  If either party is in some other state, however, you may want to also check the law of that state.

If you are planning on taping a conversation, you should get unambiguous consent from all parties on the call before you begin taping.  Once you begin taping, you should again say words to the effect of, ""the parties have consented and awknowledge that this conversation is being recorded"" so that you have a record of the consent.  There does not appear to be any requirement of a periodic beep or tone (but it probably doesn't hurt so that the parties don't claim they didn't know that portion of the call was being recorded).

Monitoring and/or eavesdropping also is not acceptable in California without the consent of all parties to the call.  Similar disclosures would need to be made in that regard.

We have numerous former prosecutors in the office with experience with the statute so let me know if we can help with anything specific.

Regards,
Kristen

What is the law regarding the taping of telephone conversations in California in
the following instances:

--  both the caller (taping party) and recipient are located in California and

--  the caller (taping party) is not in California but the recipient is located
in California.

Must a statement be made that the call is being taped?  If so, are there any
magic words?

Should there be a beep or tone periodically during the conversation?

Any other requirements?

We would appreciate a response as soon as possible, preferably early Friday.

Since I will be out of the office on Friday, please include Mike D. Smith in
your response so that he can relay it to our business people.

Thank you again for your assistance.

I thought we could all use some good news.  The recent American Lawyer associates survey -- which ranked us as the best law firm in California and ninth best in the country -- capped off a year of tremendous accolades to McCutchen.  These honors are the result of our firm values, our mutual commitment to each other and a lot of hard work. The challenge of the coming year will be not just to maintain these distinctions, but to do even better.  In the meantime, I wanted to share these with you because we all should be very proud of ourselves.

Fortune magazine lists McCutchen as one of ""The 100 Best Companies to Work for in the U.S.""  (January 2001). 

Ranked #1 as having the largest percentage of female attorneys (and the second highest percentage of female equity partners) among the top 250 law firms in the country. (National Law Journal, December 2000). 

Ranked one of the ""25 Most Diverse Law Firms in America"" (Minority Law Journal, December 2000). 

Ranked #1 law firm in California and #6 in the country for commitment to pro bono work (American Lawyer, August 2001). 

Ranked #1 in California (#9 in the country) in AmLaw's Annual Associates Survey (American Lawyer, October 2001). 

Vault's Guide to the Top 100 Law Firms ranks McCutchen one of the ""100 Most Prestigious Law Firms in the country (Winter 2001). 

McCutchen's environmental practice is ranked in the top 3 nationwide (American Lawyer, October 2000). 

McCutchen lawyers defended two of the top ten defense cases in California in 2000 (Daily Journal's Verdicts & Settlements, April 2001).

Jim--- my wife Carolyn is looking for a job.  

Since she is one of the best lawyers I know, and for other obvious reasons, I am attaching her resume in case some Enron position is available.  A natural might be Enron Freight, which I understand is looking for an attorney.

Although her title was Associate General Counsel, she was essentially the General Counsel at Eagle USA Airfreight [now EGL, Inc.] while she was there since the General Counsel at that time was a trial lawyer in an outside law firm and Carolyn did all of Eagle's business-related legal work except for litigation.  Also, as a consequence, she became well versed in all aspects (regulatory and otherwise) of the freight business.

I would appreciate your providing her resume to the appropriate person or persons for their consideration.  She has any number of references, should anyone want that.

Should someone want to contact her, she can be reached at 713-533-0330.  Thank you.

Cadwalader confirms their opinion that margin postings under the netting arrangement (inclusive of forwards and derivatives) are excepted from preference provisions and that this should not be altered merely by having an insider position, absent other claims.  I have touched base with Tribolet and Sanders to let them know that Cadwalader is available to discuss the netting agreement/bankruptcy issues as desired.

Mike/Sarah,

California Penal Code Sections 631 and 632 make it a misdemeanor to record a telephone conversation without the consent of all the parties.  In addition, civil penalties are available in the amount of $5,000 per violation.  This is true whether the caller is in California or some other state.  If either party is in some other state, however, you may want to also check the law of that state.

If you are planning on taping a conversation, you should get unambiguous consent from all parties on the call before you begin taping.  Once you begin taping, you should again say words to the effect of, ""the parties have consented and awknowledge that this conversation is being recorded"" so that you have a record of the consent.  There does not appear to be any requirement of a periodic beep or tone (but it probably doesn't hurt so that the parties don't claim they didn't know that portion of the call was being recorded).

Monitoring and/or eavesdropping also is not acceptable in California without the consent of all parties to the call.  Similar disclosures would need to be made in that regard.

We have numerous former prosecutors in the office with experience with the statute so let me know if we can help with anything specific.

Regards,
Kristen

What is the law regarding the taping of telephone conversations in California in
the following instances:

--  both the caller (taping party) and recipient are located in California and

--  the caller (taping party) is not in California but the recipient is located
in California.

Must a statement be made that the call is being taped?  If so, are there any
magic words?

Should there be a beep or tone periodically during the conversation?

Any other requirements?

We would appreciate a response as soon as possible, preferably early Friday.

Since I will be out of the office on Friday, please include Mike D. Smith in
your response so that he can relay it to our business people.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Regards,

Bruce:
 
After a couple of go arounds, below is the Indian counsel's (Mr. Talwar) opinion with respect to Enron Fuels International's (EFI) claim as to the Fixed Fee as provided in the Fuel Management Agreement (FMA).  I am sure Doug Leach has mentioned to you the mark-to-market and accrual income exposure of $14 million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution.  EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB.
 
Mr. Talwar's view is that as long as the PPA is valid, EFI has the right to collect the fee.  If, however, the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEB's claim, then EFI would not be entitled to the fee.
 
I just want to point out that as DPC (and Enron) is working for a resolution, EFI's role should also be considered.  And along those lines, EFI should take an active role in pursuing that its interest is protected.
 
Please call me at 35336 to discuss.

Dear Andy,

The answers to each of your questions is as follows :

1.      There is no theory under Indian law that Enron could use, to make an enforceable claim against MSEB in the context of the facts placed before us.

2.      The concept of agency relationships does exist under Indian Contract Law.  The concept of third party beneficiary claims does not exist under Indian Contract Law.  However, Enron cannot make use of the agency relationship theory as the Agreement has not, apart from stating that DPC will be Enron's agent, stated that DPC will be acting under the Agreement as agent for Enron for all purposes.

3.      Yes, our view is that Enron has no enforceable claim against MSEB on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the Agreement.  However, if DPC makes a claim against MSEB and a judgment is awarded to DPC for recovery of the Fixed Fee, either as such or by way of damage, then Enron would have a right to attach the amount that may be payable by MSEB to DPC.

Kind regards,

Suresh

I am a little bit confused.  Is there any theory under Indian law we could

an agency relationship or a third party beneficiary claim.  Is there any

such creature under Indian law?  Is your advice that we have no claim

   Hello Andy,

   I refer to your email of 20th September, 2001 seeking clarification in

   respect of the advice we gave you on the 19th of September, 2001 on the

   Fuel Management Agreement (Agreement).

   You wish to know whether Enron Fuels International Inc (Enron/Fuel

   Manager) could make a claim under Indian law against MSEB on any

   potential theories such as agency relationship, third party beneficiary

   claims etc.

   MSEB has to discharge certain functions under the Agreement.  These

   include amongst others, approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed

   by the Fuel Manager, providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices

   issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA, etc.

   There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered

   into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and

   no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf.

   Enron's right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement, is

   contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee

   by MSEB.  I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB.

   The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by

   the provisions of the PPA, to which Enron is not a party.  Therefore

   there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEB/DPC as regards

   the PPA.  As a result, Enron has no claim against MSEB for non-payment

   of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against

   MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions

   under the Agreement.

   I trust I have answered your query adequately.  Please feel free to call

   for any questions that you may have.

   Kind regards,

   Suresh

How are you?  From what I can tell from talking to others, it sure sounds like you have been buried on a whole host of difficult matters the past few months and traveling a lot.  I hope that at some point you are able to come up for some air, although it does seem like ""your world"" just seems to be getting bigger and bigger which, I assume, will keep making that harder to do.

I am looking forward to attending the EWS legal Conference at the end of next week, and appreciate the invitation to make a presentation with Elizabeth.  Lisa told me she scheduled our presentation on Thursday afternoon, but I thought if it was ok with you I might also attend the morning session as well on Friday.  Are you planning to play golf in the afternoon on Friday after the Conference ends?  If you were, and you had room in your foursome, I thought I might play a quick round before I headed back to New York like we did a few years ago.  I thought that might give us a chance to catch up on things in general  since I would imagine you will be pretty tied up during the Conference.  I'll touch base with Janette on Monday or Tuesday to see if something like that might be possible.  If that does not work out, I'll try to get on your calendar the next time I am in town.

I hope that you and your family are doing well.  I hope that no one in the immediate circle of you, your family and your friends was directly impacted by the tragedy of September 11.  It has been a very difficult time up here the past two and a half weeks and it will no doubt take a fairly long time for things to start to heal since the devastation that was wrought will continue to be a daily reminder for the foreseeable future.  But, hopefully, the coming together of numerous groups of people in New York City and the country in general that has occurred since September 11 will continue well into the future and make it a bit easier for people to try to move on, as difficult as that will be.

Best regards, Mark.  I'll be in touch, and I look forward to seeing you in a week or so.

I have an application for Subscriber membership from Glencore International

They identify themselves as 'trading in commodities of any kind and other

Sounds to me like they should be a dealer?

Subject:	EWS Legal Specialists Lunch

Mark: a suggestion re email to specialists. my assistant has list and we can send for you or janette could do from there. let me know...

As you know, our group of attorneys within the Enron Wholesale Services legal department has recently grown substantially.  As a result, our space at the previously scheduled EWS legal conference at the Woodlands in October has become constrained and we have outgrown our budget. Instead of having legal specialists attend the conference this year, we have scheduled a lunch on October 26, 2001 at the Doubletree Hotel from 12 to 3. We are scheduling several outside speakers to talk about current topics at the lunch. You will be getting further information from Lisa Mellencamp about the details, but please mark your calendars and plan on attending!


Mark: the doubletree hotel has a room available and charges $500. there are 35 specialists (including ebs and ees). they will serve mexican style buffet lunch for about $24 a person, plus tax/service charge. thinking of 2 outside speakers (local--i liked the ve guy the other day on privacy and documents e.g.) and for you to speak as well. janette booked you for 12-1:30 so you can eat lunch and speak and duck out if you want. i will go and think will have a couple other attorneys to sprinkle around at tables (let me know if you have view or i will just do). my assistant will handle details and i will arrange speakers etc. total cost: about $1,800 (tho having pr people see if can get any cheaper...).

 i have revised budget for conference which i will send you within next day (waiting on one thing from woodlands re it) and the lunch will be on it as well in a second category so we can get turned in and approved. i want to send this email out on the same day as a reminder of date on the woodlands to applicable people. steve kean not available but rick shapiro/ jim steffas are. bruce lundstrum signed up with skadden lawyer. klauberg signed up with elizabeth.i  were you going to talk to evans? i have call into vicki re retail ideas.

California Power Authority (""CPA"") held its first meeting with developers last week.  We attended and presented ourselves as a potential developer and seller of turbines to either the CPA or CPA developers.   CPA has issued a form of non-binding LOI for interested developers to sign.  It needs to be signed in the next 24 hours (!) in order to stay in the CPA program.   I would like to do that (subject to legal edits) so that we can stay at the table.  

I bring this to your attention because it may be press-released that we have reached agreement with CPA and that we are offering to build a project for the CPA.

Due to the extent of work required to modify our annexes, GTCs etc. on EOL (IT coordination, counterparty notification and the like) and the traders' strong preference to not often make changes on EOL product documentation, we propose to implement the EOL form change in one aggregate revision as and when the trading forms committee concludes its work on events of default and termination valuation/remedies.

Subject: Hello from Michigan State and a request


Dear Mark,

I am the Associate Dean for MBA Programs at Michigan State.  I'm writing to
ask for your advice regarding a new initiative here. I am not sure how much
you have remained in touch with MSU since your graduation.  I am proud to
report that US News and World Report recently named the Eli Broad College of
Business #16 in its annual ranking of undergraduate business schools.  And
last April, the Wall Street Journal ranked our full-time MBA program #12.
As an alum, I hope you are as proud of these accomplishments as are the
faculty, staff, and current students of the Broad School.

The Broad School recently opened a financial analysis laboratory and trading
room to help our students understand options theory better and learn trading
skills.  I would like to expand the scope of the lab to include the energy
marketplace.  That interest led me to the EnronOnline and Enron web sites,
where I found your bio.  Because Enron is the world's top energy trader, I'd
like to get your views on how I can best expose our students to the energy
marketplace.  For example, do students need access to specialized energy
trading information and software (e.g., EnronOnline.com) or do they need
advanced courses in options theory (or both)?  Similarly, is it better to
focus on risk management more generally or the energy market in particular?

I have also been working with our MBA Placement Director to better
understand career opportunities in energy and bandwidth trading.  Given the
background of many of our students (with experience in operations and
finance), we think they'll be qualified for opportunities in the energy
market (as traders or analysts) if we give them the right tools.  Finally, I
saw an announcement that Enron has collaborated with Rice University in an
e-commerce, energy and bandwidth initiative and wonder if any type of
collaboration with Michigan State is possible.

If you are willing, I would like to discuss these and some related issues
with you.  I'd be happy to call at any time that is convenient for you -
just let me know a time and phone number.  If you'd prefer to schedule a
specific time, please have your assistant call mine - Cathy Chubb at
517-432-5100 - to set a time on our calendars.

Thanks in advance for your consideration.  I wish you much luck and
continued success in all your activities.

Best regards,

John Delaney

"Accomplishments for the First Six Months of 2001","My accomplishments for the first six months of 2001 include the following:

1.    Developed New EES Trading Forms -- provided key legal technology and intellectual capital to rewrite EES forms to be largely consistent with the wholesale trading forms.

2.   Developed Setoff and Netting Strategy in the PG&E Bankruptcy -- led legal and credit team across all Enron entities in minimizing Enron credit and legal risks.  This required an expedited evaluation of Enron positions and coordination across Enron entities to determine the best possible approach to terminate and then value all PG&E contracts.

3.    Implemented New Document Retention Policy for Microsoft Outlook -- led the resolution of many critical document retention policy issues and implementation of a new policy across company lines in Enron. 

4.    Thought Leader on Legal Risk Managment -- continued to develop legal technology for better management and reporting of legal risks across Enron.  Legal Risk Memos and legal risk ratings are two examples.  These legal risk policies have been newly applied in South America and EES to better evaluate and manage the legal risks in those businesses.

5.     Developing New Businesses -- integral part in developing new businesses in freight, paper, steel, lumber, etc. by preparing trading forms and formulating new ways to manage legal risks.

6.     Deal Machine -- projects having lots of complex issues including LV Cogen II, Pastoria, Sithe, Invasion Energy, Electrobolt and Huntco.

7.     Management -- continued to build a deal-oriented legal team that understand the underlying businesses.

8.     New Generation of Master Agreeements -- taking the lead with ISDA in developing the next generation of trading master which would be a single master for all commodities, whether physical or financial.  This would reduce the legal work by half.

Subject: LeBoeuf Representations in RTO Proceedings


Mark:

As you may know, the FERC recently instituted a mediation proceeding regarding a potential Southeast RTO  (Docket RT01-100), as well as a similar RTO proceeding for the Northeast as well.    We presently represent a number of the participants involved in these proceedings (for example, Florida Power, Alcoa and Lockhart Power in the Southeast; the NY Transmission Owners and some other parties in the Northeast) and we (particularly our DC regulatory lawyers) are in the process of trying to iron out potential conflict situations among those parties that wish for us to represent them in these proceedings.  My overall sense at this point is that we will end up with representations of multiple parties in the same proceedings, with each of the party's consent.  My understanding is that your DC regulatory people (e.g., Sarah Novasel, Joe Hartsoe, et al) and Bracewell (and, perhaps, other internal folks in Houston) are involved in these proceedings for you.

At this point, it is hard for me to tell how all of the various interests line up, how the proceedings will be conducted and where the proceedings in the various geographic regions may lead, although Rick Shapiro and others in his group may have more insight into that issue.  Nonetheless, I wanted to alert you to this situation and I thought it would be helpful if we could discuss it for a few minutes at your convenience to make sure that you do not foresee a problem from your standpoint with our representations in these proceedings.  It goes without saying that even though we are not representing Enron in these specific FERC proceedings, we do not want to inadvertently be put in the position of being (or being perceived to be) adverse to the Company.

I always find these large, multiple party regulatory proceedings to be difficult ones to assess from a conflicts standpoint.  I will try to catch you tomorrow to see if we might be able to discuss this subject for a few minutes.  Since Bracewell handles most of your FERC work, I know that in the past when these types of situations have arisen, after discussions with you, we have ""kept a close eye"" on the proceedings to make sure we did not become adverse in a real sense, with an understanding that we would re-evaluate the situation if that were to occur.  I don't know if something like that makes sense here as well, but that is the type of thing I would like to get your views on.

Thanks, Mark, and I'll be in touch.

Mark,

I have attached the letter that Enron Corp. recently sent to V&E regarding legal contingencies.   In conjunction with Arthur Andersen working on its opinion with respect to the Northern and Transwestern financials, it has asked Enron Corp. to furnish information related to contingencies (including the SEC investigation).  V&E is currently working on providing its response to Arthur Andersen.  Joe Dilg would like your confirmation that we are making a consistent statement in the Enron Corp. letter with that which would be given to the banks with respect to draw requests reps (draw downs).  I have highlighted the language in red.  It is the last sentence of the first paragraph under the heading Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Investigation and Pending Litigation.  Your prompt response would be much appreciated.

Subject:	We have resolved the BPA-James River contract

All,

I am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous James River contract with BPA under favorable terms.  The signed agreements are on my desk right now.  Besides significantly reducing our litigation risk, the addition of 7.5 MW/h and the change of delivery point have added $22.8 million to the value of the contract.

BPA and EPMI have amended the original contract to specify that (i) BPA will deliver 102 MW/h 24/7 for the 5-year term of the agreement (an increase of 7.5 MW/h over the original), (ii) the disputed ""alternative delivery point"" is designated as Mid-C, (iii) all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement, (iv) the parties agree to ""book out"" the James River physical deliveries against EPMI sales to BPA at the Mid-C delivery point (so no power will flow); and (v) we will continue to invoice BPA each month for the term of the agreement, just as if the power was still flowing.

Although my preference would have been to terminate the James River agreement, BPA refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates.  Similarly, I had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out, but BPA refused to do so because--according to BPA's finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring BPA to use mark-to-market accounting.  Therefore, we executed two documents:  one amending the original contract, and another called the ""Book-Out Agreement,"" which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years.  

I am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for EPMI because (1) we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point, which (2) will make it very difficult for BPA to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to James River, and (3) the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $22 million in value to the contract.  

Thanks to everyone for your help.

Steve

Mark;

Today, Brett Wiggs told me that there will be a significant number of cuts on our Brazil staff (including Legal) within the next couple of weeks.  He asked me to think about a new structure to assist a small commercial team.  I asked about John Novak and he said ""he will probably end up being repatriated and you will become General Counsel"".  I was obviously a bit puzzled about his comments/questions and, since he was travelling to the Eletrobolt site today, I asked for some time before giving him any answers.  I wanted to know from you if this is something I should discuss with Brett Wiggs only, or you/Brett, or you/Brett/Novak, or ????

If the Brazil office remains open/alive focusing (primarily) on power marketing activities, I am sure that Karla Azevedo and I could handle all the business guys.  However, I anticipate that, within the next couple of months, there will be plenty of corporate work to be done in the near future such as Central Bank and Board of Trade matters (we would have to decide whether we keep Patricia Dutra in-house OR whether to outsource all corporate & institutional workload to outside counsel  -  I'd rather keep Patricia Dutra until everything is worked out well) as well as a lot of legal work to do on the Eletrobolt financing (where Luiz Watanabe and his trainee Aline Merone are focused).

I'd very much appreciate it if you could find a few minutes to provide me with your thoughts on the matter.  I know we are all going through heavy turbulence these days ...  sorry to bother you with this matter.

Tks & Rgds,

Sami

Mark,

Per our conversation, here are the items we would like specific guidance on from outside counsel as soon as possible:

1.  Regarding the 4 undelivered routes (Memphis to D.C., San Diego to Austin, Seattle to Vancouver, and Salt Lake to Denver), what is the probability someone could buy the contracts from 360 and ""Put"" the routes to EBS?

2.  If 360 were to reject the contracts where they pay EBS annual lease payments (Amarillo to Austin and Houston to New Orleans):
	How would the court go about calculating EBS' damages (would future payments be included)?
	Would we have the right to offset the damages against future lease payments to them?
	Would EBS get the fibers back?

3.  Regarding the swap where EBS delivered its route to 360 over a year ago, and 360 delivered Minneapolis to Detroit 1-2 weeks previous to filing (papered as one deal):
	What is the probability this would be viewed as a preferential transaction?
	If preferential, would the entire swap unwind, or could the court unwind only the 360 delivery?

4.  If 360 rejects IRUs where they have paid EBS (or LJM/Trust) the total amount up-front, what is the probability EBS will have to refund all or a portion of the money?

5.  Worst case scenario, if 360 rejects all contracts where they are paying EBS for future O&M and Collocation:
	How would the court go about calculating EBS' damages (would future payments be included)?
	Would we have the right to offset the damages against future payments to them for O&M and Collocation?

Thanks again for your help.

Subject: Project One


Yesterday, Steve heard back from Harold Busch at OFCCP inWashington.  Steve's description of their conversation was more encouraging than any of the discussions we have had with the Regional Office.  Steve gave me a general description of the conversation, which is summarized below.  
 
Mr. Busch indicated that he wanted to discuss this matter as a ""last step before litigation.""  He said that although it was an old case, it was not a closed case from the agency's perspective because there still might be victims out there.  He also suggested that the open audit probably was a ""sore thumb"" for Enron.  Therefore, he was interested in talking about possible resolution.
 
Steve indicated that he appreciated that, but wondered what Busch had heard about the audit.  Busch had heard only from the OFCCP side, and had no perspective on Enron's side (although he had reviewed our response to the show cause notice).  In response, Steve did a little water dropping.  He told Mr. Busch that the Regional Office never identified a specific victim of discrimination or unfair treatment, but provided only a statistical approach.  He said that Enron did its own, individualized analysis.  Enron looked at specific individuals to find out why there were pay distinctions in those groups where there may have been a statistical concern.  In most instances, we found legitimate explanations for the disparities; in those where we could not, we took care of the situation.  
 
Steve also clarified that there was a fundamental difference of opinion between Enron and the agency over which statistical analysis to use. The agency's approach was broad, which resulted in a demand for a big payment, as opposed to our individualized review.  Mr. Busch responded that this was why he thought it would be productive for us to get together.
 
Busch indicated that he was interested in closure of the matter, if possible.  Either it is closed through a conciliated resolution, litigation, or, if the agency is wrong, it could close the case itself.  
 
At the end of the conversation, Steve indicated a willingness on our part to talk with him and his team.  Busch offered to come to Houston to meet, or to have Enron go to DC for the first meeting, with the second meeting taking place in Houston.  Steve thought that Busch may want to come to Houston.  In terms of timing, we are looking at the week of Sept. 24 as the earliest possible date for such a meeting.  
 
All in all, it sounds like an encouraging conversation.  I believe that the first meeting should be in DC to reduce the likelihood of facing players from the local office, as I believe that they will pursue their prior view of the matter.  We are going to regroup next week to begin work on a high-level presentation to discuss with Busch when the meeting actually takes place.
 
Steve, if I left anything out, or am misquoting what happened, please let everyone know.
 
Michelle

Mark -

FYI - I have attached below a screen shot of the proposed new look and feel for the site.  We have a couple of tweaks to make, but I believe this is a much cleaner look than what we have now.

Unfortunately, because of the virus we lost a good part of development time last week.  This has pushed back the completion schedule at this time by at least a week, which means that the site will not be updated and operational by the time the law conference comes along.  If you want information about the site disseminated, I can provide an overview of the new look and feel and new functions that we anticipate having.  I believe a new target release date is realistically Nov. 1.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Mark

This is a tough battle.  It may be worse because your clients are either the same ones or geographically very close.  I would try to address it by pointing out the limitations of the simplier forms and as a fallback emphasize the increased risk (legal and otherwise) when using the shorter forms.

Subject:	Canadian Retail and Wholeale Issues

Mark, on the ""retail"" front, I did not want to get into all of the detail around what is happening in Canadian Retail in the Legal Committee call (did not realize Vicki et al. are now joining our calls), but I am meeting with Vicki later today (4:00 pm central) to review Canadian Retail.  Do you want to join?  The major ""retail"" issue is the commercial pace to transact outstripping the pace at which we can catch up legally to certain aspects of the business - not so much for transacting between us and the counterparties - but more in terms of understanding and mitigating ""distribution"" risks with and behind the LDC under applicable tariffs, T&Cs, policies and procedures.

On the related but ""wholesale"" front, I would also like to talk to you for 5-10 mins. to get your thoughts on transacting within the cross-over between ""retail"" and ""wholesale"".  More precisely, wholesale traders/originators have more and more pressure to transact at or behind the LDC rather than around a wholesale ""hub"" - particularly when it comes to power or Eastern gas.  This introduces ""retail"" type issues into the wholesale transacting process, with implications for our transacting/forms procedures.  Since the distinction here between retail and wholesale has developed around commercial ""turf"", and not the nature of the counterparty, the wholesale traders/originators are looking more and more at transactions that are ""retail"" in nature.  The result is the wholesale traders/originators pushing to use the ""simpler"" or less rigorous contracting procedures and forms developed for our ""retail"" market for these ""wholesale/retail"" deals, which I am not sure is always appropriate, but for which I am having difficulty drawing the line.  I have an idea, which is to create wholesale products under our Master Agreements which address ""retail"" type issues.  The problem is where to draw the line and the resistance to what is perceived by wholesale traders/originators as a more rigorous standard, as compared to both internal Enron Direct ""competitiors"" and external competition.

Peter.

Subject:	Re: Taping conversations in california


Mike/Sarah,

California Penal Code Sections 631 and 632 make it a misdemeanor to record a telephone conversation without the consent of all the parties.  In addition, civil penalties are available in the amount of $5,000 per violation.  This is true whether the caller is in California or some other state.  If either party is in some other state, however, you may want to also check the law of that state.

If you are planning on taping a conversation, you should get unambiguous consent from all parties on the call before you begin taping.  Once you begin taping, you should again say words to the effect of, ""the parties have consented and awknowledge that this conversation is being recorded"" so that you have a record of the consent.  There does not appear to be any requirement of a periodic beep or tone (but it probably doesn't hurt so that the parties don't claim they didn't know that portion of the call was being recorded).

Monitoring and/or eavesdropping also is not acceptable in California without the consent of all parties to the call.  Similar disclosures would need to be made in that regard.

We have numerous former prosecutors in the office with experience with the statute so let me know if we can help with anything specific.

Regards,
Kristen

What is the law regarding the taping of telephone conversations in California in
the following instances:

--  both the caller (taping party) and recipient are located in California and

--  the caller (taping party) is not in California but the recipient is located
in California.

Must a statement be made that the call is being taped?  If so, are there any
magic words?

Should there be a beep or tone periodically during the conversation?

Any other requirements?

We would appreciate a response as soon as possible, preferably early Friday.

Since I will be out of the office on Friday, please include Mike D. Smith in
your response so that he can relay it to our business people.

Thank you again for your assistance.

Chris/Mark, I am very familiar with the form and with the issues and I am happy with the contract, on the understanding that for any meters behind the LDC there is no ""consumption/balancing risk"" with the LDC - i.e. as it is a wholesale meter for a fixed volume, I am OK provided that if Domtar over/under consumes they are directly liable to the LDC for any balancing obligation.  There is also the issue of the a new charge ""at"" the Bruce Delivery Point which does not uniformly affect the market price for all market participants, but I understand that is a commercial risk Paul has accepted.

Mark/Peter - Attached hereto is an Electricity Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Enron Canada Corp. would sell power to Domtar Inc.  The agreement is in the form that we have been using for deals back-to-backed with the British Energy position (similar to the Ivaco, Atlantic Packaging, TransCanada and Sunoco agreements). Please let me know if you have any questions with respect to the agreement.  We hope to be in a position to execute within a week.

Peter, we have discussed this agreement and the modifications required to take into account the revisions in the British Energy deal.  The only other changes that I have made are simple modifications to take into account Domtar's request for multiple delivery points (some of which are behind LDCs but still considered wholesale as they are registered with the IMO).

Dear Michelle, 

The Superintendencia General del SIRESE (Bolivia) just send me the background of the Transredes case in which they are requesting my advise. 

It is an administrative appeal before said agency of resolutions SSDH Nbr. 0257/2000 and 0014/2001 concerning the assesment of a fine of 710.000 bolivianos due to an oil spill and the rejection of the appeal filed before the Hidrocarbons Agency.  

As mentioned in our conference call, I informed the Superintendencia General about my assistance to Enron in different matters and they expressed no concern about the independence of my advise nor potential conflicts of interest. Please be kind enough to confirm me that Enron acknowledges that no conflict of interest arises of my eventual assistance to the Superintendencia General cocerning this matter and, therefore, that it has no objection in order for me to provide such assistance.

Best regards,

I have periodically received requests from Andy Kramer in the form of the attached.  How should I address this issue?  I would not want to provide a waiver that may otherwise raise an issue for Enron.  Thanks in advance for your guidance.  SHD. << File: McDermott Will Waiver.DOC >>

Our board meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, November 13, in New York. It is
our annual budget meeting so it is an important meeting. I am aware,
however, that some firms have instituted temporary bans or limitations on
travel. It would be helpful to know for planning purposes whether you will
be able to make it to New York for the meeting. George James is hosting the
meeting here at the Morgan Stanley offices.

Subject:	EWS Legal Specialists Lunch

Mark: a suggestion re email to specialists. my assistant has list and we can send for you or janette could do from there. let me know...

As you know, our group of attorneys within the Enron Wholesale Services legal department has recently grown substantially.  As a result, our space at the previously scheduled EWS legal conference at the Woodlands in October has become constrained and we have outgrown our budget. Instead of having legal specialists attend the conference this year, we have scheduled a lunch on October 26, 2001 at the Doubletree Hotel from 12 to 3. We are scheduling several outside speakers to talk about current topics at the lunch. You will be getting further information from Lisa Mellencamp about the details, but please mark your calendars and plan on attending!


Mark: the doubletree hotel has a room available and charges $500. there are 35 specialists (including ebs and ees). they will serve mexican style buffet lunch for about $24 a person, plus tax/service charge. thinking of 2 outside speakers (local--i liked the ve guy the other day on privacy and documents e.g.) and for you to speak as well. janette booked you for 12-1:30 so you can eat lunch and speak and duck out if you want. i will go and think will have a couple other attorneys to sprinkle around at tables (let me know if you have view or i will just do). my assistant will handle details and i will arrange speakers etc. total cost: about $1,800 (tho having pr people see if can get any cheaper...).

 i have revised budget for conference which i will send you within next day (waiting on one thing from woodlands re it) and the lunch will be on it as well in a second category so we can get turned in and approved. i want to send this email out on the same day as a reminder of date on the woodlands to applicable people. steve kean not available but rick shapiro/ jim steffas are. bruce lundstrum signed up with skadden lawyer. klauberg signed up with elizabeth.i  were you going to talk to evans? i have call into vicki re retail ideas.

DTI Holdings, Inc. could file for bankruptcy at any point in time.  The Company is solely dependent upon financing from it's parent, KLT Telecom Inc.  The board of KLT has been advised that they have no further obligation to fund the remaining $30.5MM of availability under the Credit Facility.  Even if DTI Holdings received the remainder of availability under the Credit Facility it would only last 1-2 quarters (through the end of the calendar year) due to a cash burn rate from operations of approximately $15MM and capex of approximately $12MM for the 2Q01.  The Company also has a demand loan to its parent of $94MM and interest payable of $4.7MM.

If you would like to discuss further please feel free to call.
