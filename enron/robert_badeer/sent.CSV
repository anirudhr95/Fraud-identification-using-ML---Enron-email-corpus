	Whats up with you? Great SuperBowl. I hate the Rams, so glad they lost. I'm going down to Houston to work for UBS on the gas trading desk. New commodity for me, should be fun. Looking to get back to NY at some point in the future. I know you'll still be there, stinking up the joint. Anyway, will let you know how things go. Talk to you soon.

	Traders speculate, pure and simple. At least that what I do. The new team in Houston is the Texans. I don't really care who they are. The knicks stink. Talk to you soon.

Good, you can go from one wet loser state, to a dry hot loser state.

Good luck trading gas. After eating Taco Bell, I usually make enough to
power all of Long Island for a month.

How does a trader earn their keep? you get a commission selling to another
firm or speculate on price movements and take a position?

Let me know when you are in NY, so I can ensure that I am away. 


Good luck in Houston, go Titans!!

When you get here on Monday morning, come to the 5th floor reception of the new building.  If your badge is not there, then I will come and pick you up when you get here and bring you up.  Your badge will be ready Monday for sure, whether it be morning or afternoon I am not sure of.

"Hello from a long lost friend","Paul,
	I hope this is the right address. I ran into Kristian and Monica the other day, got Kristian's card, and promptly lost it. I am going solely on my formidable memory of the address. Sounds like you guys had a bigger freak show there than we did here. What an incredible story. Hopefully neither of us will have to go through that again. I'm out of the office here and heading down to Houston to trade gas. It's west basis, so I should be able to draw on my power knowledge a little bit. Things got a little crazy here, will have to tell you more over several beers, I think that is the minimum it will take. Erica is excited for a change, although Houston is not her first choice, she's a trooper and will find fun things to do. How is Sarah doing? I hope she and the baby have made it through all the changes. There is a woman here who I think would be interested in coming to London. She is young (only 23) but has raw talent. She started here last summer working in the California book. Let me know if you could use a hand, as I said, she has raw talent and drive. Thats all from here. Stay in touch and say hello to Sarah. 

Bob
