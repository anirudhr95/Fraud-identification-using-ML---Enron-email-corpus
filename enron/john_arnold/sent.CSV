Subject:	(01-154) Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (Give-Up Trades) IMPORTANT MEMO



Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Subject:	The Syndicate Game

John -

I want to float an idea past you to see if you have any interest.  In the
past, I have not made a habit of participating in PaineWebber syndicate
offerings because, frankly, investment banking was not our strong suit.
Now, with the UBS merger, our deal flow is starting to look much better (see
press release below).  5.79% isn't a mind-blowing number, but it is
impressive in light of market conditions and the fact that ""UBS Warburg was
the only bank to have a positive return among the 17 banks listed including
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney.""

As the market rebounds, I think you may benefit from participation in IPOs
and other syndicate deals.  If you have an interest in this, let me know and
we'll discuss it further.  Thanks.

January 12, 2001
UBS Warburg has been ranked first in IPO performance for US offerings in
2000, according to Commscan's Equidesk. Achieving a 5.79% return, the result
is particularly significant considering the Bank was not involved in any of
the top 10 largest IPOs of the year.
Lead managing 12 IPOs, UBS Warburg was the only bank to have a positive
return among the 17 banks listed including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs and Salomon Smith Barney. UBS Warburg also tied first place
for IPO ""batting average"" (the % of IPOs that trade above issue price),
achieving the highest ""batting average"" overall. Three deals in 2000 which
helped achieve these impressive statistics include Intermune
Pharmaceuticals, Luminex, and Bruker Daltonics.

Subject: FW: NG deal in California



sorry not to send this earlier..

i checked out the dept water resources site.. (wwwowe.water.ca.gov).. nothing too illuminating except that their power costs have come down from over $300 in march to$45 this month but due to the nature the borrowing costs associated with the LT contracts, they will not be able to pass on much savings to consumers (gotta love that).

we were supposed to have received a copy of all their LT purchases in July. checking what happened there.  we know that there were 54 contracts signed .. half linked to gas which covered 1/3 of cali's total needs (looks like for 10 years).  some left open the possibility of the state procuring gas supplies for the plants.. dwr has signed 6 agreements w/ gas suppliers..pretty sure cali uses 25,000-45,000 MW per year which is about 70 contracts a day in gas terms.  If they locked in 1/3.. it would be about 25/day.. the deal they just did was about 16/day for just cal02..probably waiting for curve to flatten further to do more..

they purchased another 500 MW in Aug - the 17th (all 10-12 years)..and to date it looks like they have not purchased anything (have been selling into the grid daily) but not liquidating any previously negotiated LT deals (LT is anything beyond 3 months).

it sounds like they are planning on buying more of their gas requirements.. Sempra (who has LT power contracts with DWR and gives them the ability to buy 80% of their gas) said DWR had not purchased any gas yet.

 

 

Pls note story on page 5 & 6 of todays gas daily... 

mentions California Dept of Water looking to hedge gas purchases for long-term contracts. 

over the past few days we have seen Major Inv. Bk Buying  Cal 02 Nymex Calls and the same bank buying Cal 02 Socal basis calls - very good size

This, we believe, is a hedge for this DWR story. The article mentions that they were ""looking at ways to expand its gas purchases"".

The article does not mention, nor do we know, how far out they are looking to purchase. 

Socal basis has moved on the back of this deal.... 
Last week: 
Cal 02 = 9 cents    Cal 03 = 20 cents 

Today 
Cal 02 = 18.5 cents   Cal 03 = 22 cents....so the spread has moved from 11 cent  contango  to 3.5 cents. 

<<102401.pdf>> 

Other than the call buying we saw related to this deal, the rest of the flow we are seeing is : sellers of vol. 
Last night settles: 
Cal 02 vol  51.5% and Cal 03 vol 37.25% - and we are 1 % lower in Cal 02 since the open , and 0.5 % lower Cal 03.

It's a big blur in my mind.  I look at general levels and for anecdotal evidence.  have seen zero anecdotal evidence so far.  will also watch aga's for the indication,  but so will everybody else.

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get ""done"" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with ""Dutch"" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

Subject: Nymex Status



John, 

I met with Bo last Thurs and continued the discussion today with Bo, David Keller (Nymex CTO), David Salomon (Nymex), Brad Richter and Jay Webb.  Nymex indicated that they would like to move ahead very quickly on getting a price posting arrangement with them on Access where they will be showing prices all day including the OTC products.  Once this is complete they would also like to contemplate an arrangement on a Phase 2 technology sale with them.  They are currently scoping our the Phase II requirements.

Nymex does not have the resources to build the API (interface with EnronOnline) and would like us to do the development.  This type of arrangement requires the desk to make some decisions:

Are we willing to post numbers on Access electronically and have the transaction occur on Access?  This will give us the risk of being double hit. 
Are we willing to dedicate technology resources to this effort (and away from other EnronOnline priorities) and will the desk get enough benefits to justify the opportunity costs? 
What would it take for you to post numbers in this fashion (fees, preferential fills, etc).  You have the original specialist proposal we sent to them.


We indicated to Bo that we would get an answer on this and call in the next couple of days.  If we can answer these questions, Jay will have someone look at the Access code and determine the cost to us (development time).

We will also be meeting with Nymex next Wed to talk about Phase II.  We think that we can structure a transaction that would include an Access Price Posting in the short term, Specialist role and an obligation to look at our Phase II proposal.  If we do not get a firm commitment on Phase II within a specified period we can review our specialist role and ask them to pay for the API we built to access.

Please call me to discuss at 713 853-0397.

      The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we
      received
      today.

      Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
      position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02
   futures.

      If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and
   734
      May
      02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other of
      those
      expits are achieved.

Two Energy Auctions in End Jan-Beg Feb:
In the last week, it has been announced that the CDWR (California
Department of Water Resources) will not honor the Bids resulting from the
two auctions held this year.  Out of the 31 contracts, only 8 have been
signed.  The other 23 are expected to either remain unsigned/uncontracted
or their terms (their prices) are expected to change since power prices
have decreased so much since the beginning of the year.

John- have we seen any selling in the 10 year curve to support the

Subject: American Rice RFP Clarification


Based on questions I have received, I wanted to make sure everyone had the same information in preparing their bid on the American Rice natural gas RFP.
 
American Rice holds transportation on Dow moving gas from the various pipeline interconnects with Dow at Katy to their facility in Freeport. ARI will give you monthly nominations and be responsible for imbalances on Dow.  If you provide an index related price, we would like the option to convert it to a fixed price at our option.
 
I hope this helps you in your bid preparation.  Proposals are due September 20, 2001.  Thank you for your consideration.

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get ""done"" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?

We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with ""Dutch"" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

I am trying to talk via MSN messenger service and it will not accept jarnold@enron.com or any other reasonable email path.  What is your official email path?  I am assuming that you are using Outlook.  I am here at work trying to close a deal.

I will forward your message to Grass, but I want to visually see the layout of the floor.  I will end up having spots on five and six.  Also,  Nelson Ferries' and Linda Roberts' location are very important to the Wellhead/Ecommerce effort.  And yes, John will need room to grow.

I think the location i talked about before is actually better for you.  The area towards the edge of the building borders the northeast gas group, long-term originators, and mid-market orig group.  not exactly who you need to be around.  the location in the center is much closer to the east gulf group, specifically sandra, and the same distance to the central and texas trading groups.  most importantly, it provides room for both your group and the trading group to expand.  call me if you want to talk further....

John,
 
We have developed a ""morning briefing"" for Gary Hickerson that includes primarily views on the crude and products markets.  Recently, Gary has asked that we include a brief overview on Nat Gas in this packet.  We have worked with Chris Gaskill to get the morning briefing that he puts together for you and your traders and find it very helpful.
 
However, I am interested in going a step further and would like to talk with you or one of your traders on a regular basis in order to get a more trading-centric view on this morning packet.  Specifically, I want to ask the question, ""What do you view as most important in this information"" so we can develop our own ""value added"" information for Gary's group.
 
Is there one of your traders who I might be able to meet with (after market close, of course) to discuss?
 
Thanks, John.

"RE: HEY JOHNNY","i just cant get too enthused about the short side.  why did cash go out trading +5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand.  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week.  fine.  what's it going to trade next week.  the gas daily swap implies flat, but it's lagged the actual spread all month.  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen.  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space.  so either the market is wrong (maybe but a dangerous assumption to make) or I don't see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve.  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high, but those certainly don't seem to be going down very fast.  march is off 8 cents since jun 29.  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354, then why is sep too high at 298?

sorry sorry sorry:
things back to normal around here, which unfortunately is boring.  tired of
my apartment, tired of my girlfriends, a few more weeks like this and I'll
be tired of my job.  need something to juice up my life.  vacation was
good.  took a few days in belize to get certified for scuba.  very cool.
then a weeklong finance class at wharton.  good to learn something new for
a change.

very few views of the market here.  not sure that all the bearishness is
not already built into the market.  problem is the bearish sentiment is
still tremendously pervasive.  everybody, everybody, everybody, is short
but wants a rally to 315 to sell more.  just not sure what the downside
target is.  cash isnt behaving like we're gonna run out of injection space
in october.  if i owned a proprietary storage field and thought we'd
approach shut-ins in late oct and be at a much lower level, i either would
not inject now or better yet, i'd withdraw now to have room for all that $2
gas later.  but hell, the cash market is trading over prompt.  not just
because it's hot, it's been doing so for about 3 weeks now.  thus i could,
in fact the storage economics tell me i should, withdraw gas or definitely
not inject so i could have flexibility later.  something doesnt add up.
the spec market is convinced we're going to shut in but the phys market is
not telling the same story.  so let's assume we're not at shut-ins or have
trouble placing gas in october.  is the market overpriced?  don't think it
necessarily is considering the winter will have a risk premium associated
with it regardless of the fundamentals after last winter until we get the
first weather forecast of the winter.  i think we could stay at this price
level for a while and then have the next move down late oct early nov when
people try to withdraw gas and nobody wants it.  i think it was in 99 when
the first 3 weeks of nov were injection.  can you imagine going into dec
with 3.15?   but if there is injection capabililty through oct 31, and the
winter is going to stay relatively high due to risk premium, how far are
the storage spreads going to widen?


 biggest position right now is short jv and short a ton of u vol.
producers are waiting for any move up in cal 2 to give it a spanking.
falling back in love with longer term gas though.  think 2/3 and 2/4
spreads are golden.

thoughts?

   how it goes my man. its all good here. finally getting settled into my

   personal life-got the family moved ,in the new house etc. john paul was
   up

   this past weekend and he came over to my place to sy hi. good guy-has a
   cool

   chic.ive been meaning to email you but as always busy as hell. i had
   dinner

   with bo collins last nite and a few cocktails-funny to see him changing

   roles. i enjoy talking to him but hes being quite the diplomat now.
   seems

   the new role fits him actually and he seems to be enjoying it.still hard
   for

   me to believe hes not gonna miss trading.

       hows business/life and the vaca? what are your thos ont he mkt?

      demand has come back a great deal but im not sure its gonna
   help-maybe

   too little too late. ive been trading this a little mroe actively now
   that

   the mkts been leaning mosrtly one say but fortuntely sold early in the
   week

   on the rally before the aga-and after.biggest problem for muchlower
   prices

   in the short term is it seems now the whole mkt has the same supply and

   demand view. but if we can believe that production is up 3% which seems
   to

   be the implication we'll have no problm moving about 3.1 tcf(3.2 basis

   doe).economic growth will be at best flat to last year thru 2001 and i'd
   say

   that means the winter will struggle to get much bullishness--ie our
   biggest

   concievable draw would be in the order of 2.2 tcf-leaves us around 1 tcf
   end

   march, hard to get too excited about that. sprds? not much of clue-i
   tend to

   think inverses cont to errode like feb/apr-but maybe not until mkt gives
   up

   on winter. prepensity for us to stay contango maybe accelerates.that
   this

   year.

      you think we get to shut in levels? since so much prod growth appears
   to

   be from independents does that raise the avg shut in value from say 1.60
   to

   $2.00 or higher??

       anyway-be cool,hope all is well. enjoy the weekend. are you going to
   be

   in NYC anytime soon?

John,
Thank you very much for your time Wednesday afternoon ,we appreciate it. Your feedback is very important to us as we continue to define the end product. As discussed we too only see the value in the product  if we have mutiple ""customers"" participating and as I told you we have had many hedge funds and CTA's request a similar service. Over the next 2/3 weeks we will be presenting to a number of these interested parties and would be happy to keep you updated on progress. I anticipate more aggressive ""marketing"" of the product from September onwards as we are still stuck in the summer vacation schedule and it is making serious ""roadshowing"" difficult.
Again thank you for your time and please dont hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have or any further feedback you may want to provide (either to Deutsche or Campbell ).
Regards,
Kevin

The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we received
today.

Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02 futures.

If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and 734 May
02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other of those
expits are achieved.

expect that you're still gainfully employed, given your position within the
core energy trading business.  Let me know if you need anything from us.

John,

Hello and good Monday morning to you.  I briefly meet you while talking to Paul Racicot on Friday at Front Porch Pub.  With Matt working here in Freight you probably already know we are not well off these days.  Next on the chopping block is never a good place to be.  

This is a forward question but what the hell.  I was wondering if you knew of any positions available in your area.  If you can believe it I am not ready to leave Enron behind yet.  Thanks for your help.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

John,

Thanks for taking my call this morning and giving me the lay of the
land.  You mentioned the fact that there are a couple of HeadHunting
firms out there that are doing some business on the Trading side...do
you have any idea what firms those are so I can do some checking around
to see what they are all about etc....

Any other ideas you might have would be appreciated.

Thanks again for the time.  I do appreciate it....

Not so impressed with David goldman.  For a guy who has worked in derivatives for 10 years, couldnt answer some simple questions.  Very poor financial derivatives knowledge even though he worked at CRT for a long time and a Lyonnais for a while.  The only value I see in him is that he worked at BP for a while and might have some knowledge as to how they work.

Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred
you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was
planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.
I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in
addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an
offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate
recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via
phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good
opportunities here.

   Dear Mr. Arnold:

   I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student at
   Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring
   potential
   employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am interested
   in
   derivatives trading.

   I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
   professional experience has been in a variety of roles within financial
   institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk, before
   starting my MBA.

   I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of your
   colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston or
   NYC
   areas in the next few months.

   Thank you for your time and consideration.

If we are going on a family vacation this year, we need to start planning.

someplace.  Anyway, we need to do some planning or we will be out of luck.

I'm on Continental flight 1231, departing July 4 at 1:25 PM, seat 15D,
returning Sunday, July 8.  I hope you decide to take the later flight
out Saturday.

I talked to the hotel and they have rooms and a scuba instructor available
to dive with us.  Let me know your flights so that I can arrange the
air transfers between Belize City and Placencia and dive lessons through
the hotel.  I haven't booked it yet since they require a non-refundable
deposit.

Call me with any questions - or if you change your mind so that I can
make alternate plans.

John,

I heard from Wes Colwell that you had been appointed by Lavorato to layout the sixth floor for gas.  This morning I spoke to Wes regarding the placement of the Upstream/Ecommerce desk on six.  I have taken 6 spaces but I need two more.  The two I would like to use (e29 & e30) are currently being occupied by the Central Region.  I would like to move these individuals to two spots right across from their current location (e35 & e36).


For your information, the current six spots that I have are :  e17, e18, e21, e22, e23 and e24.

Please call when you can.  Good luck trading...

Hi Louise,

We are having a typical trading pace so far today.  It is too early to tell if any counterparty is really cutting back.  Like yesterday, however, Aquila is buying longer dated physical gas and selling spot gas; so once again they are a big net buyer.

GAS TRADING TEAM

Can you guys please prepare a coordinated list of no more than 35 people that can come in on Sunday between 2- 6:00 pm to test trading applications.  Due to the combination of the moves (over 900 people) the IT group wants to ensure that your applications are functioning properly before Monday morning.  

The list should be weighted heavier towards those folks who can identify system problems rather than unpacking boxes.  There will still be alot of the move team on the floor finishing installations etc.  

Please provide the list by end of business today (thursday).  

Thank you!
Tammy

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  (storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not convinced this rally in products is different.

wrong assumption--he intends to come out as a big bull at this year's october conference --sees production treadmill scenario again--expects tightness to rear its head in h2-02. they have reduced their dwgom numbers in 03-05. he is still bearish this year thats it--he thinks time to get long is at 2.00$-----

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

Please resend the forms needed although I may have sent the necessary docs with the courier that delivered the check.  Do not believe we've seen the worst yet.

Will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a while.  Even with the rally today I do not believe we've seen the worst yet.

John -

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

Thanks,
Mike

"RE: wheres the love?","Sorry,sorry, sorry. 
Havent had internet access at home for past 5 weeks.  Much easier to write these at home as when I'm done trading I don't want to look at my computer.  
For november, very neutral.  Cash is impressive.  Agree shutins, switching, and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium.  Think with cash/futures at 20 cents, x/z looks crazy.  As soon as z becomes prompt, the fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will come off.  Like your h/j trade.  Hard to see it really being worth 9 cents at settlement.  Been buying a lot of y/y cantango as I think next summer will be a piece but longer term gas story still very real and customers know it.  Wouldnt be surprised to see 2/3 go to 50+.  I think x has some room to go up, but not a lot.  Dont want to play the market from the long side as been burned before trying to get long a market that is still in a downtrend.  Seems like the curve will just keep rolling down with each expiry.  All the winter months might settle 2.25.  As such, the best thing to be short is jan.

Jeff,
My mom said that you would email me a few questions that are standard in an
interview.  I was wondering if you could do that for me please?  I am very
nervous and need all of the help I can get.  Thanks for telling mom that I
needed a suit.  I told her but she didn't believe me.  If you have any other
advice feel free to give it to me.  I have a project that I did in a problem
solving class that my teacher told me to take into my job interviews.
Should I take it to my internship interviews?  The project was looking at
statistics of accidents that occured in a certain hospital, evaluating the
correlations over a few years, making suggestions on how to improve and
explaining why certain things were happening.  I am not sure if that will
help in an internship.  What department in a company would that have to do
with?  I think I might be interested in that.
Thanks,
Sarah

$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's

"","Jeff:
To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:
John

The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we received
today.

Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02 futures.

If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and 734 May
02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other of those
expits are achieved.

Savita,

Attached is the latest Robotrader spreadsheet.

As you may recall, we tried several different approaches to minimizing the cost of the market running up and then down again.

The solution which gave the best solution was also the simplest one.

Principles as follows:

- Basically an advanced Offset to Last Trade
- Definitions
	- Intensity: Measures the length of time between transactions as a rolling average over the last x number of transactions (the Intensity Factor)
	- Intensity Factor: The number of transactions used in calculating the rolling average Intensity
	- Dead Interval: The period of time in which (if nothing occurs), an event or transaction is deemed to take place.
	- Offset Reversion Ratio: The percentage by which the Offset will be reduced if a Dead Interval passes
	- Spread Minimum: The minimum spread which can be used.
	- Offset Minimum: The minimum offset which may be used.
	- Spread-Offset Minimum: The minimum amount by which the spread must exceed the offset
	- Spread Reversion Rate: The amount in dollars by which the spread will decrease if a Dead Interval passes
	- Position Sensitivity: The position which, if exceeded, will cause the V Factor Adjustment to increase
	- V-Factor adjust: The amount by which the Momentum will be increased if the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- Momentum: The measure of the degree to which the market is either just buying or just selling
	- Adjusted Momentum: A Momentum number which may be boosted, causing a larger price reaction when the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- Offset: The amount by which a bid or offer will be increased/decreased when a transaction occurs.
	- Spread: The difference between the bid and the offer
- General Principles and Mechanics
	- As each Sell (Buy) occurs, the Momentum decreases (increases).
	- The Adjusted Momentum is the same as the Momentum, unless the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- If the Position Sensitivity is exceeded, then the Adjusted Momentum is boosted by the V-Factor Adjustment
	- The Offset is calculated by looking up the Offset value on a table for the specified Adjusted Momentum
	- The Spread is calculated by looking up the value to boost (decrease) the Spread on a table for the Specified Intensity
	- As the Intensity value drops, the Spread widens. As it increases, the Spread decreases.
	- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease
	- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large
	- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.
	- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen
	- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.

 

Dave

In the last week, it has been announced that the CDWR (California
Department of Water Resources) will not honor the Bids resulting from the
two auctions held this year.  Out of the 31 contracts, only 8 have been
signed.  The other 23 are expected to either remain unsigned/uncontracted
or their terms (their prices) are expected to change since power prices
have decreased so much since the beginning of the year.

John- have we seen any selling in the 10 year curve to support the

Hello Mr. Arnold,

Thank you for speaking with me today with Kenneth Parkhill.  Unfortunately,
none of my teammates are available to meet with you today.  Would you please
review our questionnaire and reply back to me with your comments about the
questionnaire and answers to any questions that apply to your work.

We will follow up with you later this week if we have questions.  Thank you

"RE: ICE","Hey:
1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state.  
2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive.  

Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary.

Subject:	ICE

Hi.. 
I hope you are all ok.. I am sorry for any losses that may have touched your friends and family..

I looked at the ICE/LCH announcements.

I have a few questions:
1. Will ICE be able to work as a deal entry system as well as mechanism to post markets?

My concern here is that under the Deutsche proposal we would be able to do a deal with you over the phone and then post it to their system.. and no other market participant would be able to see that transaction.. it would then go straight to the clearing.

Currently, I'd say that only 2% of the time ICE has a tighter market than EOL.. this because they do not have the liquidity (and likely will not).

There is not a high probability we would ever contribute to this liquidity over our own system (Enron online) so the ability to deal directly with you in still imperative. 

2. Can margin at LCH be netted across products?

Looking forward to speaking.
Thanks and Regards,
Caroline

Notice No. 01-365
October 30, 2001


TO:
All Exchange Members / Member Firms
All Clearing Members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING




EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last
night
approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through
clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap
(EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures
market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced
electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.

Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the
necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the
Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under
the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with
our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the
advantages
of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity
markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a
whole.

The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services
with
natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of
approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's
transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the
Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing
members.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.

The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify
the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the
price
at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the
parties involved.

The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of
250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at
the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted
during the closing range.

Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural
gas
swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most
popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this
move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS
mechanism.

Subject:	RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)


The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

The y/y spreads have come in decently over the past week and a half.  The 2/10 spread has moved from 104 to 94.  It may be a good time to move the 3-10 to a cal 2 trade.  Pira just gave their seasonal conference in NY and they are very bullish long term gas.
	Pira's
	forecast		Nymex 
Cal 2 	2.45		2.99
Cal 3	3.00		3.31	
Cal 4	3.70		3.40
Cal 5	4.00		3.48
Cal 6	4.10		3.57
Cal 7	4.20		3.66
Cal 8	4.30		3.75
Cal 9	3.60		3.84		(TransAlaska Highway Pipeline)
Cal 10	3.80		3.93
3-10	3.84		3.59

Regardless of what you think of Pira and long term price forecasts, the rest of the market does listen.  They have a tremendous amount of respect in the industry and affect how customers and producers hedge.  The flow, which has been buyers over for the way backs, I think will get more pronounced, especially if the front goes down.  

In the past week, I've sold Duke 40,000/d Cal 6-10 and 25,000/d Cal 7-10.  I've sold PGE maybe 30,000 day Cal 4-5.  The only seller has been El Paso whom I believe is hedging production.  He is trying to pressure the y/y spreads as a spec trade that I think was/is being done to front run the corp hedges.  I've used it as an opportunity to put a lot of spreads away for inventory down the road.  If you want to buy this strip back in the next 6 months, I think it's going to be much easier/cheaper to roll it closer.

Aren't you used to me popping in every few years by now??  And are you

calling me wacky??  =)

Basically, I just started working for a new-ish hedge fund in Boston with

Chuck Clough, the former Chief Investment Strategist for Merrill.  I got a

random phone call yesterday from a woman who is just starting a hedge fund

here in Boston.  She had heard I was in town and has been trying to get a

hold of me to help her start her hedge fund.  She finally got my number from

someone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck.  I'm not

sure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a

great opportunity it would be to work with her and her ""team.""

The only person on her ""team"" that she described was Jeff Gossett.  She said

that she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and

he had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently

sold) until Enron recruited him away.  The stories of the recruitment seemed

a bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe.  Anyway, she said

that he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund.

Having never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot,

I was wondering if it was true.  I would never leave this opportunity, even

if she offered me the world, but I have friends who really want to break

into hedge funds, so I was doing some due diligence on their behalf.

Does it sound like the same guy?

I'm trying to put together the proposal for the exchange.  Who should I work with to nail down the Specialist structure.  We can handle the technical structure.  Attached is the draft proposal that I put together to begin developing a term sheet.  The Specialist requirements and incentives were my initial thoughts.

Louise Kitchen/John Lavorato have requested that each of you prepare a brief one page summary highlighting your accomplishments for this review period by end of day Friday, June 29, 2001.  

You may use the PEP system and do a self-evaluation (let me know if you need assistance w/this) or send me an email bullet pointing your accomplishments.  If you have already done a self-eval, you do not need to respond to this email.  HR is compiling the information for OOTC and I appreciate your assistance/timely response.  I apologize for the quick turn around-just got the request myself.

Please call or email w/any questions.  Thanks.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.

I need a favor in return for interviewing your boys.  Remember Mark Findsen.  He's looking to get back into the business, possibly from the trading side.  I actually think he might make a better orig guy.  He has been in the crude and products markets for 10+ years.  Has no experiece in trading energy but has been day trading equities for past year.  He asked if he could get a round of interviews at Enron.  Could you set up a round for him?

John -

I realize you don't have ""fresh money"" now, but if you happen to come across
fresh money in the next month, I want you to be aware of a new crossover
fund.  The fund seeks to invest up to 50% (may exceed 50% under certain
circumstances) of the portfolio into late-stage venture capital companies
through relationships that Putnam and Thomas H. Lee Partners (great name in
private equity) have with various participants in the capital markets.  The
remainder of the fund will be in small- and mid-sized publicly traded
companies managed by Putnam's Specialty Growth team.

Let me know if you're interested, and I'll send a kit over.  So far, nice
trade on the ENE GJs.

That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.

John, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject system to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to automate some aspects of you daily activities.  I will try to send you a few power point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.

It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning systems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve building functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with your own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the necessary predictive power.

"RE: Credit from brokers","Understand.  Enron has been Man's biggest account for years and during that time we have paid them a lot in commissions.  They approached us on Wednesday to try to increase the margin required, even though we were below the credit threshold that had been established in the contracts written 5+ years ago.  I refused to agree to change the margin calculations.  It became clear that Man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given that Man is a relatively small shop.  I agreed to xpit some positions such that they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account.  At the same time I told them I was transacting business as usual and if they couldnt handle/didnt want the clearing business I would clear somebody else but that was a permanent decision for them to make.  Clear our business always, or clear it never.  Paribas has stuck with us throughout and I intend to clear the majority of future biz with Paribas.  I agreed during hours of phone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursday, which we did, but the rest of the position would stay there.  They agreed.  We specifically stated the rest of the positions and the options would stay and we would work out those positions over time.  &!@$ them if they are trying to go back on that.

ENE is in a severe liquidity crisis.  Even if EDF makes mistakes we have to be careful how we treat them because Enron's cash position is very precarious.  It's good to insist that EDF give us what's owed especially since they seem to be wrong in this case but as far as lines of credit go, ENE is in a much worse position than ever before.  

I am going to get a guarantee to Fimat today from Enron Corp with respect to ENA trades.  We have never had to do this before but if I do not get it Fimat will keep their trade line at $11 million.  Soc Gen (extends credit under Fimat line) is being a big pain but having spoken to our bank people we have no choice but to be grateful we are getting credit these days.  

Please keep this bad cash/credit situation confidential.

"RE: changes to curve?","maybe we just hold all the gas until next winter.  we'll worry about that problem next september.  
novy expiry can go anywhere.  Too early to say.   Probably around $2 though as I cant imagine who is a baseload buyer of gas in november when the US is a net injector the first 1-2 weeks barring cold spell and the pipelines are trying to start withdrawing.

i think cash gets much stronger over the coming weeks relative to nov.  first inclination when cash comes up is that futures go up.  however, there is an 80 cent spread between cash and december.  cash can easily go up without dec moving.

Think we're settled on Xmas week to go skiing. If this not good, reply via email (Dad, you can phone).

Therefore we're looking at 22nd to 29th (possibly 30th??) Dec. 

Location; Mart and I not got strong view other than not daft money, and would like nice scenery and maybe a few shops for Mart. i don't know enough about where we are likely to get good snow or not, Jim/Jenny might better advise.

In view of our restriction re. dates we might have limited choice anyway. I will have a look on internet, Jim/Jenny would you do same. Mum and Dad, might be better if you go to travel agents.

Suggest we touch base over weekend to review options.

Nick

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's

"RE: schedule C","Agree with the first paragraph.

Bets get tougher from here.  Not so obvious and require much larger size to get same juice.  Generally not a good position considering the current world order, or disorder.  Not much juice in gas basis either.  This is where we see whether we are good traders or just great fundamentalists.

Looks like all the schedule C activity, we will make quarterly earnings.  That being said, we've lost a lot of cushion and I predict that fourth quarter we will carry some large VAR going into year end.  Let me know if you think we should revisit limits, particularly if we need to offer up to Lavo and crew the best bet for Enron's risk capital.  

As an aside, I think the best bet may be gas.  Regarding gas, I'm thinking the ""basis"" bet is probably more likely than huge NYMEX bet given current NYMEX level may not have enough juice to provide required profit, this being said both price and basis horizon don't appear to have much trading topography?  In East power, we are dog piling length in the Pennsylvania area, an area without a significant gas fired stacks, shorting the Midwest, net net ending up long.   In the West, shorts are still driving risk and in the words of Chuck Berry -how low can it go? Limbo alone suggest we have to hit the dirt sometime, it is trading sub $40 handle

ICE Melts Resistance ToOil Swaps.
  
09/03/2001
PetroleumIntelligence Weekly 
P1 
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved 
The oil hedging business is poised to take another step up the evolutionary ladder, after the upstart IntercontinentalExchange(ICE) confirmed plans to offer clearing services for its over-the-counter contracts from the fourth quarter of this year. With similar moves also planned by the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), OTC contracts such as swaps are increasingly moving into the mainstream. Long regarded as the wild cousins of regulated futures, OTC oil contracts were distinguished by their fuzzy legal status, lack of standardization, and absence of clearing services. Changes in USlaw and the spread of electronic trade have pretty much eroded the first two differences, and the ICE initiative will deal with the third. The main differences now lie in regulation and settlement (40#02-06). ICE'sclearing services will be provided by the London Clearing House (LCH) - the clearinghouse for London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which was taken over by ICE last month. ICE will now be able to offer a one-stop hedging shop for cleared futures and derivative contracts, allowing traders to use a single location to conduct full hedging strategies and to pool their risk. One advantage is that it will allow net margining between IPE Brent futures and other ICE products, such as West Texas Intermediate swaps. Clearinghouses offer financial risk protection, acting as a central party to shield traders against counterparty default. Derivatives trade at ICE is currently conducted between companies on the basis of bilateral credit agreements. 
ICE'sinitiative in part reflects its increasingly fierce competition with Nymex. The New Yorkexchange will this week launch its new Brent crude futures and options contracts, as a direct challenge to the merged ICE-IPE (40#35-04). In return, ICE will first introduce clearing services for two actively traded USproducts, involving West Texas Intermediate crude oil swaps and Henry Hub natural gas swaps. These swaps are the planned centerpiece for Nymex'slong-delayed internet platform, eNymex(40#04-05). They also pose a potential challenge to Nymex'stwo core futures contracts, if trade migrates to swaps. Some traders view swaps as more effective hedging tools. Calendar-month WTI swaps, for example, are widely used to hedge against producer or refiner supply contracts, which use average prices during calendar rather than contract months. 
The evolution of swaps is also part of a deeper market trend, which has been actively encouraged by the USgovernment and some big energy companies. The UShas been working to give derivatives a stronger legal framework since the late 1990s, after Russiadefaulted on its debt and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund came to the brink of collapse. That effort culminated in legislation late last year giving derivatives a stronger legal footing, thus eliminating the chance that parties might renege on unfavorable contracts by claiming they were really unauthorized futures deals. The spread of electronic trade - particularly on ICE - has accelerated the change, by encouraging liquid trade in standardized products. This is no accident. In an interview with PIW a year ago, John Browne, chief executive of BP - one of ICE'sfounders - said that the platform had been set up in an attempt to create ""a real exchange market for swaps, rather than simply one-off, over-the-counter activity."" This would make hedging more transparent and efficient, while eroding the role of intermediaries, he said. Browne drew parallels with the earlier evolution of interest-rate swaps in financial markets, into ""a standardized business."" (39#27-08).Last week, ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprechersaid the exchange wants ""to try to change the way the market works.""

"RE: EDF request","Tell them that margin will be posted as normal, no excess nor any intraday calls.  Since ENE is flush with liquidity, he should be very comfortable that we can pay our bills.  The positions will roll off through time until the position gets very small and then we will x-pit everything out of Man and close the account.  Anything different and all dealings between Man and Enron in energy will be terminated in both OTC and futures.

Subject:	EDF request

John - I returned a call to Ira Polk and Kevin Davis today at Man.  Ira was not in so I spoke with Kevin.  

Kevin asked me if Enron would consider posting more margin than required by NYMEX on our option positions. He said that ""given ENE is now flush with liquidity"" he thinks it would make Enron ""look good"" in front of the EDF Board.  He asked for twice the margin required by NYMEX but stated that he would be ""ecstatic"" with 1.5x (about $5 million.)  He specifically asked me not to elevate this request to your level but I feel you have a right to know what EDF is asking of ENE.  He also told me that if we did not post the additional margin then EDF would have to give us intraday calls every time the market moved against our positions.  Kevin also state that EDF is too small compared to a bank and that he would prefer if EDF odes only execution of ENE deals and we clear all ENE transactions through a bank.  

I have been out of town so may be missing on part of the story but I think it's ridiculous that EDF wants us to do them a favour when they ditched us when Enron was in a  severe liquidity crisis.  I told Kevin that I did not think we would meet his request but that would check on it internally.

Subject: EQUITY COMMENTS


Hi- thought you'd want to know some of the recent equity comments from a few of the funds.  Bad comments first.. ENE: Ospraie, one of the Tudor funds has actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our ""credit situation"".  At one point they probably had a 12,000 contract short gas position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now.  They have studied our financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not determine how to value us.. I think the bigger concern though is our credit line situation.  Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is linked to stock price.. obviously the street does not know the real details but the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the contrary are causing some to panic.  I've heard the same come out of SAC which is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short-ENE.  SAC has just started trading with us.
 
I am not sure what to do about this.. luckily Ospraie is the only group commenting on our credit.  I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB- and thats not new.. I have not been able to trade with them for the last year.  I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim.
 
I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest.. and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies (8-10) plus some growth component (5) for developing businesses.  And at $20, they reckon we get taken out anyway.. the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value.
 
Good news- Ospraie covered their short at $30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $4.
 
Other comments from Catequil.. they generally think a lot of the energy sector (E+Ps) are close to bottom.  They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 10.5 PE soon (even though ours is currently 12.5 and they believe in us) because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better.  (Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there).  They were never short us.
 
On other names:
EOG- could see it down to $22 but see $35 based on NAV more realistic.  Like EOG and Chesapeake- well hedged.
 
Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid-east exposure.
 
Like Talisman- only has exposure in Sydan, Nexus- Yemen

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  (storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not convinced this rally in products is different.

Hi Eric,


Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
talking about during our phone conversation this morning.


Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to Enron. The
monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
physical product.


Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.


Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
settlement.



Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes given
month by month in MMBTU.

(See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-Enron.xls)

Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please check
if you have credit with SG for this period.
If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
credit.
In terms of credit, SG is good with Enron for this period.

Thank you,

Alexander Werner

He wanted to know how to increase business with Enron.  I referred him to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you please address this with him?

I'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gas
market wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contracts
is not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the short
term, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out and
transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they
are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the
futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some
point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall
market interventions have been extremely ineffective.

The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we received
today.

Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02 futures.

If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and 734 May
02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other of those
expits are achieved.

"","The y/y spreads have come in decently over the past week and a half.  The 2/10 spread has moved from 104 to 94.  It may be a good time to move the 3-10 to a cal 2 trade.  Pira just gave their seasonal conference in NY and they are very bullish long term gas.
	Pira's
	forecast		Nymex 
Cal 2 	2.45		2.99
Cal 3	3.00		3.31	
Cal 4	3.70		3.40

Cal 10	3.80		3.93
3-10	3.84		3.59

Regardless of what you think of Pira and long term price forecasts, the rest of the market does listen.  They have a tremendous amount of respect in the industry and affect how customers and producers hedge.  The flow, which has been buyers over for the way backs, I think will get more pronounced, especially if the front goes down.  

In the past week, I've sold Duke 40,000/d Cal 6-10 and 25,000/d Cal 7-10.  I've sold PGE maybe 30,000 day Cal 4-5.  The only seller has been El Paso whom I believe is hedging production.  He is trying to pressure the y/y spreads as a spec trade that I think was/is being done to front run the corp hedges.  I've used it as an opportunity to put a lot of spreads away for inventory down the road.  If you want to buy this strip back in the next 6 months, I think it's going to be much easier/cheaper to roll it closer.

CHICAGO (Tuesday, June 19, 2001) - Philips Electronics and the United States Soccer Federation today announced a nationwide contest to create the first official fan chant for the U.S. National Men's and Women's Teams.  Designed to propel U.S. players to victory, the contest kicks off a long-term sponsorship deal between the electronics giant and U.S. Soccer.  In conjunction with its sponsorship deal, Philips' has announced a goal to increase the U.S. fan base significantly over the next five years. 
Fans can enter their original chant by visiting the U.S. Soccer website from now until August 15th, 2001.  Visitors to www.us-soccer.com will find entry forms, rule and complete contest details. 
The grand prize winner's chant will be selected by a panel of Philips and U.S. Soccer representatives and will debut at the October 7th World Cup Qualifier in Boston.  The winner will also be able to root for the U.S. Men's and Women's National Teams on his/her new Philips Home Theater system.  Two runners up will be awarded Philips DVD players.

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

        May 28, 2001  TIME Magazine Topping Out In Houston Again  BY CATHY BOOTH THOMAS/DALLAS  Send the architects south. Silicon Valley may be powerless and profitless, but Houston, the nation's energy capital and home to the oil-baron excesses of the 1980s, is back in ""bidness."" The energy giants in Texas have big fat wallets these days--and even bigger construction plans. Not since the boom days of 1982, when trophy architects like Philip Johnson and I.M. Pei reconfigured the skyline, has Houston seen so much construction activity by the energy sector.  Leading the parade, ironically, is Enron, an old energy behemoth that has reinvented itself as a high-tech trading firm dealing in everything from natural gas to Internet bandwidth. In fact, its new 40-story headquarters, designed by Cesar Pelli, will be fronted by a seven-story ""podium""--or shorter building--to house what Enron is calling the largest commodities-trading environment in the world.  This environment, spread over four floors, each the size of a city block, will become home this August to 2,000 employees trading commodities that range from Old World (crude oil, petrochemicals, steel and lumber) to New World (emission credits and derivatives). Chairman Kenneth Lay and CEO Jeff Skilling are even moving from their skyboxes to work in seventh-floor offices so they can peer down into the pit.  When the bigger 40-story structure is finished in December, Enron's will be the first new skyscraper in downtown Houston since 1987--to be followed by three more by 2003. Besides Enron, Calpine Corp., the nation's leading independent-power company, based in California, will move into a new 32-story high-rise. And Reliant Resources, the IPO spun off this month from its Houston parent to deal with Texas' new deregulated electricity market, has signed on for offices in a 36-story skyscraper.  What's fueling the high-rise fever is simple: excess cash. Enron's first-quarter revenues were up 281%, while Calpine's revenues and net income were each up more than 400%--even with California's deadbeat utility PG&E owing the company more than $300 million.  After a decade of contraction in the business, with companies having shut offices from New Orleans to Oklahoma, deregulation and new marketing strategies are sparking Houston's renaissance. ""Enron is a leading example of the new energy industry. Ten years ago, there were no trading floors,"" points out Stephen Brown, senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. Both Calpine and Reliant will also have trading operations in their new offices.  Though Houston no longer relies so heavily on the energy business (down to 48% of the local economy from 82% in 1982) the turnaround sure feels good after the city lost more than 15,000 energy-sector jobs two years ago, says Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It has gained those jobs back, plus some. Says Smith: ""The current boom is what's keeping Houston afloat while the rest of the country is suffering.""  None of this matters to real Houston lovers, of course. They're just interested in bragging rights. After a bad decade, they're beginning to sound like the biggest and the best in Texas again. ""Boomlet?"" says Laura Schwartz, spokeswoman at Enron. ""It's more than a mini-boom. It's a boom.""         	







Enron to meet government for talks on power dispute

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

BOMBAY, India (AP) - The Indian subsidiary of American power concern Enron Corp. said Tuesday it would meet government officials for talks on a power supply dispute. 
""We look forward to hearing the proposed solutions ... particularly relating to creditworthy purchases for the power,"" said a statement from Dabhol Power Co., Enron's Indian unit.
The statement comes two days after the company issued a preliminary notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, a state-run utility, that it would stop supplying electricity if the government company continued to default on payments. 
Representatives from Houston-based Enron will meet Wednesday with officials from the utility, the federal government and Maharashtra, the western Indian state where the project is located. 
The MSEB has denied it defaulted on paying electricity bills to the power company that is setting up a $3 billion project in Maharashtra state. MSEB officials said overdue December and January bills of $48 million should be offset against a fine of $85.31 million it imposed on Enron for not supplying power during the period. Enron disputes the fine. 
Politicians in Maharashtra say the cost of Dabhol power is too high and have called for renegotiating the tariff. Others have suggested selling power to nearby power-hungry states. 
Politicians complain Dabhol's costs have averaged more than 4 rupees (11 cents) as against 1.8 rupees (four cents) per unit agreed in 1995 for the naphtha-generated electricity from the 740-megawatt plant. 
The controversy erupted last year when prices shot up to 7 rupees (15 cents) per unit because of worldwide fluctuations of oil prices and depreciation of the Indian rupee.

INDIA: WRAPUP 1-Indian state questions power deals, cites Enron.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

05/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 22 (Reuters) - India's ambitious plans to throw open its cash-strapped power sector to the private sector, already wracked by controversy involving Enron , received a further setback after Karnataka state said it would reopen sealed deals with 11 power firms. 
The technology-friendly southern state of Karnataka said late on Monday that it was re-opening power deals with 11 private sector firms which together were due to meet half the state's demand over the next 10 years.
""Enron is a lesson for all of us. Now, it (electricity) cannot be at any cost,"" V.P. Baligar, chairman and managing director, Karnataka State Power Transmission Corp (KPTCL), the state's monopoly power distributor, told Reuters in an interview late on Monday. 
The 11 power projects are based on the Enron model and involve a total of 2,000 megawatts (MW). None of the 11 projects have started generation. 
Analysts fear that Karnataka's move, coming amidst the raging controversy over Enron's giant power project, will scare away badly needed private investment from the country's inefficient power sector. 
India needs to add 100,000 MW of power over the next 10-15 years to meet growing demand and is hoping to get this through investment from private and foreign companies. 
But investment has been hampered by a slow-moving bureaucracy, legal hassles and loss-making utilities who are frequently unable to pay for the power purchased. 
ENRON IMBROGLIO 
Last week, Enron's Dabhol Power Company moved to break a contract to sell power to Maharashtra state, peeved over payment defaults by the state utility Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). This is widely seen as leading to a pull out. 
MSEB and Dabhol have been at loggerheads for over six months over payments due to DPC by the state utility. The project has been marred by controversy since its inception in 1991, with critics charging that it was charging too much for the power it produced. 
MSEB, which DPC says owes it $48 million, is planning to retaliate by slapping a penalty of 4.0 billion rupees ($85.2 million) on DPC for failing to ramp up capacity. 
""We will issue the penalty as soon as the bill for May is received,"" the official, who did not want to be quoted, told Reuters on Tuesday. 
MSEB had imposed a similar penalty on DPC - which DPC has not paid - saying its plant could not be ramped upto full capacity within three hours from a cold start. DPC officials refused to comment on the issue. 
The Enron project was first billed as a showcase of India's decade-old reform programme but now is regarded by critics as a symbol of policy bungling. 
The project involves the setting up of a 2,184 MW power project costing $2.9 billion in two phases. The first, of 740 MW, is up and running while the second, of 1,444 MW, is due to be commissioned next month. 
( $1 = 46.9 rupees).

Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's waters

05/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Executives of Enron Corp. say they are withdrawing from a large natural gas project off Qatar, partly because the venture doesn't fit with the energy company's focus. 
Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to work with Elf, a subsidiary of France's Total Fina, and the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qatar North Field.
But the company pulled out, believing there are better places to invest its money, said Alex Parsons, a company spokesman in London. 
He said the project doesn't fit with Enron's current focus of emphasizing businesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale markets such as those for natural gas and electricity and broadband. 
Those involved with the project said last year it could end up requiring investments of up to dlrs 10 billion over six or seven years. 
Enron said Monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group, which said in a news release it had started negotiating with other international players to become stakeholders. 
With the transfer, United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will own 75.5 percent of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released. 
Enron said it would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group that were ""in line with our core business activities."" 
M. Carol Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, said Enron's move is consistent with its exit strategy from international assets that generate low returns.

GERMANY: Enron says Lampertheim hub attracting interest.

05/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DUESSELDORF, May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. trader Enron said on tuesday there was growing support for the south west German Lampterheim gas hub it had been actively promoting since early April. 
""Liquidity is growing slowly, it is not (Belgian hub) Zeebrugge, but customers are posting orders and are coming forward with surplus amounts,"" sales chief Helge-Juergen Beil of the company's German division in Frankfurt told Reuters during a Euroforum industry conference.
""Our main strength is that we both sell and buy for various periods."" 
Beil said a number of deals had been done, but would not quantify them. 
Enron on its trading platform enrononline.com currently quotes Lampertheim gas sales and purchases in parcels of 20 megawatt hours in euros for the spot market and the year ahead. 
The town, near Heidelberg on the border of the Hesse and Baden-Wuerttemberg states, complements border hubs such as Bunde-Oude, Aachen, Baumgarten, Waidhaus and Oberkappel. 
Beil also said Enron was supplying eight local and regional utilities and industrial gas customers in central and southern Germany with a total four terawatt hours of annual demand. 
Enron's share of total requirements in each case varied between 20 and 94 percent of their annual purchases. 
He said non-discriminatory access to the German pipeline grid had not been achieved by newcomers to the market. 
In order to help create fair rules for access and their montoring, Enron, like other newcomers, was demanding a state-installed arbiter to supervise the liberalisation process. 
Other speakers at the conference said the success of newcomers was still hampered by the long distribution chain and an enforced need for hourly, rather than longer term, balancing, which could cause exorbitant penalties payable to incumbents. 
But some gas grid owners had turned out to be co-operative, customers were queueing up, and there were prospects that existing surplus gas volumes from international take-or-pay contracts could be freed up and eventually traded.

John, here is a power point slide that provides a draft outline of the problem at hand.  It is very draft in nature but I wanted to get the working version over to you ASAP.  I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc....

I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product.

I will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document. 

I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc.

My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto.  I may have an opportunity to build the southeast market by supporting John.

I am very grateful that I met you and other key Enron traders during this job search.

not necessarily looking for predictive power.  that's a 3 year project.  just for market making skillset.  The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias.

John, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject system to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to automate some aspects of you daily activities.  I will try to send you a few power point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.

It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning systems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve building functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with your own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the necessary predictive power.

I like it. But I am the minority. relative to nat gas I think HO has greter propensity to spike. right now I am working on just such analysis -will have details late rthis week.  I will probably spread TZ6 or NYMEX vs HO (going long the ho portion). Remember that unlike NG, about 90-92% of HO is made on demand -so stocks are not as important. also I think relative to NG HO sotcks are lower in that we are not headed to all time highs lin ho like we are in ng.also EUrope had ver vey warm winter last year. Reversion to norm especially in early (nov-mar) could keep things tighter if arb opens to EC.
We are beginning to see run cuts. I think OPEC is serious.
what si your view on ng t this week and next?

Subject:	Refco Update

Gentlemen

We met last week with their management and CTO. We have determined the hardware and software requirements for the deal.  We are in the process of drawing up a term sheet and proposing a financial structure.  We have set a meeting for Nov 12 in NYC to get into the details of financial terms and structure.

The deal is going well and we are working with the following hi-level parameters:
Initially 8 Nymex look-a-like-products: Natural Gas (prompt, prompt+1, prompt+2), WTI (prompt), Gasoline (prompt, prompt+1), Heating Oil (prompt, prompt+1)
2 customer buckets with different spreads and volumes: Institutional and Retail
Volumes for Institutional will be 1 contract moving towards 0.5 contract and 0.2 contract possibly to match Nymex mini concept, Volumes for retail will be 0.5 contracts moving to 0.2 contract to match Nymex mini concept
Data feed with price and volumes sent from EnronOnline to Refco system customized and powered by EnronOnline software
Initially target scope is designed for a capacity of 5000 customers, 500 simultaneous
Refco will take credit risk for their customers and post daily collateral with Enron
Refco will pay Enron a one-time license fee for a 3 year contract with an additional annual maintenance & support fee
Enron will keep all additional margin generated by the transactions and Refco will keep the commissions generated and float from additional margin held.

Obviously, the above parameters are the preliminary thoughts and subject to change and negotiation.  We are just beginning to model the potential revenue and cost streams and there will likely be some adjustments that will come out of this exercise.  There are also a number of alternative technology scenarios to pursue if we have more or less money to work with.

Please feel free to call me x36413 if you have any questions or comments.

Regards

John Cummings

In place of the original transfer of options that we sent you yesterday, I
propose the following transfer instead. You will note that it includes no
options at all.

Joe Murphy, CEO of Refco Global Futures and Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC will be here Thursday afternoon through dinner to further our discussions for providing a hosted marketplace where Enron would stream products with wider bid/offer and smaller volume to their ""retail"" customer base.  

The purpose of their visit is to firm up our discussion so that we can start drafting a term sheet for the deal

I have carved out 1 hour this Thursday Oct 4 from 4:30 to 5:30pm in EB 27C2 to discuss the products that we currently make markets in and the volumes Refco currently handles for their customers.

Would you or someone in your group be interested in attending?  Several of the guys from the Oil & Refined products group will be there and I would like to have at least a representative for gas that could speak for you.  I have sent a note to Kevin Presto as well.

Regards

John Cummings

Subject: Back office issues



Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

""I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out"" 
""It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade"" 
""We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for"" 
""We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type"" 
""I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here"" 


From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said ""they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

""we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude"" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the ""backoffice""?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

I think all of us, including myself, underutilize this tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one message every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what counterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well.

John,

We finally heard from Bo.  Looks like we may be getting together soon to discuss our proposal.  I would like to get back together with you concerning the specialist requirements and incentives when you can.  I've attached my draft for you to look at.

I also received a call from Mark B. Fisher.  Apparently Mark caught wind that Bo talked to us.  Mark is excited about the opportunity of the locals getting access to EnronOnline numbers.  Mark wants to clear the local trades on EnronOnline and enymex.

Let me know how you want to proceed. Thanks

The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.  
 
Are the FedEx's getting to everybody Monday or are you sending them Monday?

Bush Adviser Rove Owns Stock in Major U.S. Firms
By Jim VandeHei
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- President Bush's chief political strategist owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the president's top legislative priorities, newly released federal records show. 
Karl Rove, one of the president's most trusted advisers on almost every major legislative initiative, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron Corp., Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Johnson & Johnson, among other holdings. (Federal law requires public officials to report their assets, income and debts in broad ranges only). All of these companies could be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on which the president consults Mr. Rove: tax cuts, increased defense spending, an industry-oriented energy policy and health-care reform.
Mr. Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to pay capital-gains taxes, as permitted by federal law. In the meantime, ""I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings,"" Mr. Rove said. 
Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture, which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts, according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year. 
Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside groups, including corporations. 
""He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here,"" says a White House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House. 
President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms. 
The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock, according to a White House aide. 
The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting work he did for the company, the documents show. 
Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies, including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is unclear when the transaction went through. 
Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between $100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP. And National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice had $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Chevron Corp. stock and was paid $60,000 last year for her work as a director at the company. Mr. Rove disclosed smaller holdings in BP PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.

Saudi Arabia Sets Pacts With 9 Oil Firms

06/04/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil companies yesterday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s. 
The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects.
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2 project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core Venture 3 project. 
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export. 
The other companies selected were BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon Oil Canada Inc. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine international oil companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its energy sector since nationalizing the industry in 1975. 
The deals, worth a total of $25 billion or more, involve the development of three natural gas fields in the kingdom and a number of related power plants, transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects.
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil for export. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $12-billion-to-$16-billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead a second core project. Royal Dutch/Shell was chosen to lead a third project. The last two projects have a value of $7 billion to $10 billion each, Prince Saud al Faisal told reporters. 
The other companies selected were BP of Britain, TotalFinaElf of France, Conoco Inc. of Houston, Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, Enron Corp. of Houston and Marathon Oil Co. of Houston. 
Harry Longwell, director and senior vice president at Exxon Mobil, said the financial terms of the deal are still being discussed. But he said his company is ready to begin the work when the final contracts are signed. 
""The Saudis' expectations are extremely aggressive,"" Longwell said. ""It's a very tight schedule and in recognition of that, the ability to get this done is one of the key reasons we were chosen to lead two of these ventures. We already have a senior management team in place and are ready to go to work immediately."" 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said the companies are expected to profit on returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with more than 15% of the investment cost. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity owner in the projects. 
Saud said if the companies discover oil, they will be compensated and the fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 and closed its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country and is the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

Enron is my spiritual teacher

FINAL
E.10
(Copyright 2001)

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create ""shortages"" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for ""maintenance""? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.

A.19

WHAT GOES UP usually comes down. And few industries are more prone to boom and bust than energy. 
Imagine the news stories a few years from now: ""Crisis hangover -- energy stocks sink as prices plunge; But California consumers still stuck with high bills.""
""The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the 1990s, as dozens of big new power plants come on line, and the just-completed Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years. 
""The one bright spot for Texas generators is California, where consumers are locked into long-term contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of 2001. 
""Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook, arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap. 
""But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis, a former governor of California, warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed."" 
Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it. But the one thing no one - - even environmentalists -- suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies. 
""To economists, letting the price rise is the solution,"" said Paul Portney, president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. ""To elected representatives, having the price go up is the problem."" 
Political memories tend to be selective and short. But it was the energy glut of the 1990s that contributed to California's blackouts, $3 gasoline and $400-a-month heating bills. Likewise, high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction. 
As a story in the New York Times noted, an energy investment boom ""promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months, many industry executives and private analysts say."" 
Through much of the 1990s, there was a glut of energy. Fuel of all kinds was really cheap. 
How cheap? Adjusted for inflation, as cheap as in 1949, economists calculate. 
Energy is the oxygen of the economy, and rock-bottom prices contributed to the long economic boom. But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar. 
People ditched their economy cars for SUVs. Houses got bigger, ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum. Stores, offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators. 
Low prices discouraged energy development. 
""Oil was so cheap for so long, that people were selling their refineries,"" Portney said. ""You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at $2 a BTU."" 
As demand soared and supply fell, prices rose. Profits have grown so robust that green fuels, such as biomass and wind, are becoming economically viable. The oil industry is booming. Refineries are expanding. The long-delayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely. So many power plants are under construction that the market may be flooded with as much as 200,000 new megawatts by 2004. 
Investments in energy efficiency -- from new-age superconducting transmission wires to better light bulbs -- are suddenly looking attractive for the first time in decades. 
""High prices will dampen demand, high prices will encourage supply, and will encourage people to make better use of what they've got,"" said Robert Ebel, director of energy for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""So we're starting on the down slope. We're not very far down. When prices start to decline, I can't say how far they will go. But they will decline, because that's just the law of supply and demand. Prices decline, demand starts to creep up again, there's less incentive to add to supply, and here we go again.""

INDIA: Rating firms may be judging India harshly-analysts.
By Vidya Ranganathan

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Analysts have reacted with surprise to last week's decision of ratings agency Fitch to cut India's sovereign ratings outlook to negative from stable, and say there are no grounds to downgrade the country. 
Fitch, which rates India's foreign currency obligations at BB-plus, a notch above Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, cited concerns about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate.
However, economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies, or a fallout of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's threat to exit an Indian power venture over payments problems. 
Moody's and S&P said on Friday they have not revised ratings or outlook but are disappointed with fiscal reform efforts. 
Local currency and stock markets reacted nervously to the announcement, but economists said most concerns were exaggerated. 
""When the direction of reforms is positive and government flows are improving, the outlook should not change,"" said Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at local rating agency CARE Ltd. 
Even if the provocation for the rating review was the Enron episode, analysts said the problems were specific to the power sector and will not affect the robust foreign investment the country has been receiving. 
""Enron was a bad deal, made on unreasonable terms in the first place and does not reflect the ability of the government to pay its dues,"" said an economist with a U.S.-based fund. 
Some of the confusion arises from the various ratings assigned to India. 
Moody's has retained a positive outlook on its Ba2 rating since late 1999, while S&P has a stable outlook and a BB rating. 
CONCERNS OVERSTATED 
Analysts said none of the factors Fitch cited had deteriorated in the past year, since it first rated India. 
Fitch said India's fiscal-monetary mix was unfavorable, real interest rates were high and there was the risk of a debt trap. 
India marginally overshot its budgeted fiscal deficit in 2000/01 (April-March) to 5.2 percent of GDP, down from the previous year's 5.6 percent. 
But laws to control government spending are awaiting parliament's approval, there are incentives for disciplined state governments and a determined effort at privatising state-run firms has begun. 
Burgeoning fiscal deficits have persisted for a decade and public debt at 60 percent of GDP is high, but at six percent annual growth, India is one of the fastest expanding economies in Asia. 
""In terms of external liquidity, India is much stronger than its BB+ rating while even its public debt to GDP ratio is lower than that of some Asian nations,"" said P.K. Basu, chief economist for South East Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston, Singapore. 
Foreign investment has been pouring in - portfolio flows at $2.2 billion so far in 2001 are at record levels and compare with $1.56 billion for the whole of 2000 - and foreign exchange reserves are strong at $42.8 billion. 
Interest rates and yields have also dropped, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) adopting an aggressive easing stance this year to prop the slowing economy, and inflation is benign. 
""The hardest initial steps are being taken and there is still a lot of inertia, but soon there will be a willing audience and reforms can progress faster,"" CARE's Nagarajan said. 
But critics said the changes were still very superficial and structural reforms that would spur long-term growth and demand were lacking. 
""What the rating agencies have emphasised is fiscal consolidation, which means better revenue streams, efficient expenses, user charges for public utilities...we promised these three years back and haven't moved very far on those,"" said Saumitra Chaudhari, economist with local rating agency ICRA Ltd. 
""We still do not have a securities bill, mature debt market and our banks have not cleaned up,"".

INDIA: India rupee ends off lows, fwds close higher.

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - The rupee ended unchanged on Monday, recovering from the day's low after a large European bank sold dollars, dealers said. 
It had slipped to a low of 47.04 per dollar in early deals on dollar purchases by a jewellery importer.
The rupee ended at steady at d47.01/02 per dollar. 
Dealers said there was no impact of Friday's comments from international rating agencies which had raised concerns over continuity of foreign investment and dragged shares lower. 
The currency recovered from lows around 47.085 on Friday, reacting to international rating agency Fitch's revision in the outlook for India's ratings on sovereign debt to negative from stable, citing worries about fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. 
Later, rating firms Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) said they were disappointed over the government's reform effort. 
Moody's also raised a concern about India's Maharashtra state utility's ongoing tussle with Houston-based Enron Corp and said: ""the dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations"". 
It added this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country. 
The comments weighed on bond prices, which extended losses on Monday, and in turn led to paying in dollar forwards. 
""After a long gap, there was corporate paying interest in forwards today,"" a dealer with a state-run bank said. 
The six-month forward ended at an annualised 5.10 percent compared with Friday's 4.95.

UK: Spectron trades UK's first post-NETA spark spread.

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Energy brokerage Spectron said late on Friday it had traded the first brokered gas-electricity arbitrage, or ""spark spread"", deal in the UK since the launch in March this year of new electricity trading arrangements (NETA). 
""Now that liquidity has returned to the electricity market post NETA, such transactions are expected to become more common..."", said Spectron in a statement.
The deal was concluded between UK utility Powergen and U.S. energy group Enron . 
Spectron said the trade, covering winter 2002, was for 60 megawatts of electricity at 21.42 pounds a megawatt hour and for 100,000 therms of gas at 24.85 pence a therm. 
The winter period specified in the deal ran from October 1 to March 31. 
For the electricity, one day was defined as 2300 hours to 2300 hours. 
For the gas, one day was 0600 hours to 0600 hours. 
The deal comes as the industry moves to create standard terms and conditions for spark spreads. 
Powergen is due to meet in mid-June with other traders, including Aquila Energy , for talks aimed at agreeing standard terms. 
""It is hoped that the market will soon establish standardised documentation leading to a standardised product that will help promote liquidity in one or more levels of efficiency,"" said Spectron.

INDIA: Enron India lenders meet in Singapore on Tuesday.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Lenders to Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a two-day meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial $2.9 billion power project in India. 
Representatives of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank , ABN AMRO , and Bank of America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India , State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate.
Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slated to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase. 
But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which is the sole buyer of Dabhol's electricity. 
Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to continue supporting the project. 
But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans. Loans of around $638 million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions. 
The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug, plan to oppose any such move. 
But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output. 
The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million. 
Last month, Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power. It has also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings. 
The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors. 
Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors. 
""The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country,"" Moody's said. 
India's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday. 
""India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected,"" he said. ""There is no need for concern."" ($1 = 47 Indian rupees).

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase.
By Clarence Fernandez

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - India's reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase, with plans afoot to free up private supply, overhaul debt-ridden state utilities and recraft tariffs, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters. 
With investors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts.
""Sanctity of contracts has to be kept,"" Prabhu said. 
The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent owned by Enron. The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign investment, at $2.9 billion. 
Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction. 
""Absolutely,"" he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have entered a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation needs. 
""In India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in favour of generation,"" he said. ""We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process."" 
Prabhu added, ""We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made."" 
CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT 
A chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's western coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the country's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics. 
An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the Indian politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government, and whom local media call ""technocrats"". 
Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers, lifting curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform effort. 
He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a stumbling-block for foreign investment. 
""They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs, and that's a major change we are trying to make,"" Prabhu said, referring to the states. 
SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments, and supply power to most of India. 
India estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment. 
But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves. 
RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE 
Last week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. Competing agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard & Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit. 
Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent, and tackling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector. 
The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment. 
Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances - looking at technical, commercial and tariff issues - is expected to report within a few weeks. 
""For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states,"" he said. 
The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally, he said. 
Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years. 
""In the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 percent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable,"" he added. 
Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently. 
Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, or even free, as many did in the past. ($1=47 Indian rupees).

Nigerian president slams US energy firm Enron for ""poor performance""

06/04/2001
BBC Monitoring
Source: The Guardian web site, Lagos, in English 4 Jun 01/BBC Monitoring/(c) BBC

Text of article by Francis Obinor entitled: ""Obasanjo chides Enron on Lagos power project""; published by Nigerian newspaper The Guardian web site on 4 June 
For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project (IPP) initiated by the Lagos State government two years ago, Enron, the American firm got a hard knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend [2-3 June].
In his conclusion, Obasanjo accused Enron, a major player in the electricity project, of poor performance and bad faith. Ostensibly angry at the delay in the project's full take-off and the 30 MW recently connected to the national grid from the scheme, the president on the American Cable News Network (CNN) declared: ""Enron has played a dirty game on us. Dirty game in two ways."" 
Beside putting up an exorbitant price, the company according to the president, also failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Continuing, Obasanjo said: ""The price at which they (Enron) have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant. Two, what they told us they would do, they have not done."" 
While refusing to disclose the firm's charges, Enron Vice-President of Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream. ""We have a project that is very close to coming on line,"" he said, stressing that the company's desire is to see the project work effectively in Nigeria, especially in Lagos. He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact. 
The state government brought forward the June 2001 deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first 30 MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago. 
At the Government House on 23 May, Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another 30 MW would be added soon. He noted that, contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go, it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption. ""The concentration for now is not as private homes, we would soon get there,"" Tinubu assured. 
The controversial IPP programme, which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating, has suffered several setbacks, including Enron's initial plan to sell its shares to AES, another American company. Last April was originally fixed for the project's take-off but the failure of Trevi, a construction company in charge of transmitters, caused a shift in the date.

India: India and Bush Administration: Beyond assumptions

06/04/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence Wire

SOON after Mr George W. Bush Jr. won the US elections, Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India. A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir, not force it to sign the CTBT, and get tougher with China. 
Mr George Bush's decision to ""drop by"" the External Affairs Minister, Mr Jaswant Singh's meeting with the American National Security Advisor, Ms Condoleezza Rice, seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria. This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology. The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions.
Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir. It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who, probably, do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them, and is not happening in their backyard. But there is another powerful force in Republican politics - the religious wing. This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The Attorney-General, Mr John Ashcroft, who are Christian fundamentalists. 
Mr Bush himself claims to be a 'born again Christian'. 
The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy; it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy. But the few times it does intervene, it is when it feels a country is ""persecuting Christians"". And when it does intervene, no Republican administration dares cross it. 
For instance, China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians. Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion. Because of this issue, Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China, routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations - including trade relations - with that country. 
India, as an emerging power, is more carefully watched, and frequently mentioned in the American press. Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to ""elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party"". In its latest human rights report, the US State Department noted these acts with concern. 
The Pope's mention of these issues to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was also noted in the American press. India is, perhaps, half a step away from being branded as a country that ""persecutes Christians"". 
A self-professed born-again Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian right's cause, trumping all other bilateral issues. Human rights may not matter to the isolationists, but Christian, and to a lesser extent Jewish, religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration. 
The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either. But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT. The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security. They frankly care little about Indian security. They would love to be able to restrict India's ability to test and use its weapons. To them, nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world. Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise, the Republican administration is likely to tighten the anti-proliferation screws on India. 
The third fallacy relates to a tough, long-term strategic re-alignment the Bush Administration will demand of India. Mr Bush's foreign policy-makers are unreconstructed 'Cold Warriors'. In the post-Cold War era, they are desperately ""searching for an enemy"". They appear to have settled on China as ""the next enemy"". Their next step is to search for ""allies"" 
who rarely challenge their views. Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are ""natural allies"". But such a decision has an enormous range of long-term consequences for India. 
To discuss just a few: Most of the Indian military's equipment comes from Russia and the former Soviet Union. Allying with the US will be seen by the Russians as abandoning them, and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment. Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest India is also eager about Mr George Bush's proposed missile defence programme. But this technology is far from proven, and during the decade over which it may be developed (if it gets past Congress), China will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons. These may, primarily, be a deterrent against the US, but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely afford. 
The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their ""closest allies"". India today is neither fish nor fowl - not quite a threat, but not quite an ally either. It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system. 
Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India, it could never afford the sticker price. So, before it rejoices at the notion of anti-China hawks in the White House, let India ponder over the unexamined consequences. 
The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term. 
Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose, and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller. Mr George Bush's background is as a Texas oilman - and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry. 
In fact, they were among the biggest ""contributors to his campaign"". 
The Enron Chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, is a friend of Mr Bush's, and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet. He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry. In the near term, Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to ""make sure that Enron's interests are not neglected"". If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction, his opinion of India, and consequently, his administration's dealings with the country, are likely to be coloured far more than we think.

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project
2001-06-04 08:41 (New York)

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project

     Mumbai, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Indian banks that loaned money
to Dabhol Power Corp., the local unit of Enron Corp., will try and
persuade their international counterparts to keep alive the $3
billion project at a meeting of lenders in Singapore tomorrow.
    The two-day meeting will be the first between the two groups
of bankers since they met in London on April 24-25 to discuss an
escalating dispute on power prices that has pitted Enron against
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only customer.
     ``We will discuss how we can go about resolving the
problem,'' R.S. Agarwal, executive director at Industrial
Development Bank of India, or IDBI, said. IDBI is the biggest
lender to the Dabhol project.
     The outcome of the Singapore meeting, to be held in the
offices of ABN Amro Holding NV, one of the biggest international
lenders to the project, will be crucial to the banks, which have
loaned as much as $2 billion to Dabhol.
     Indian banks fear the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's
decision to stop buying power from Dabhol may strengthen
international lenders' resolve to terminate the project and invoke
government guarantees to recover their loans.
     ``Foreign lenders want to close the (Dabhol) chapter,'' said
Pradyumna Kaul, an activist with Enron Virodhi Andolan, a non-
government organization opposed to the project. ``They are eager
to call in their loans, even if it means taking a 10 to 15 percent
cut, rather than spend more on supervision and legal expenses
while watching the saga linger.''
     Local banks such as IDBI are most at risk as the Maharashtra
and federal governments have guaranteed only foreign banks' loans
of about $600 million to the venture.
     IDBI alone has exposure totaling 21.58 billion rupees ($460
million) to the project, including 15.28 billion rupees in
guarantees.
     Foreign lenders such as ABN Amro, Citibank N.A., a unit of
Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston in
April approved Dabhol's decision to begin termination of its power
supply contract with the board. They are in favor of canceling the
project.
     India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in
fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and
loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.

                             The Fight

     Maharashtra State Electricity Board Wednesday stopped buying
power from Dabhol as the dispute escalated. The board on May 24
told Dabhol Power Co. it was canceling its power purchase
contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board notice it was set
to pull out of the project because of the six-month dispute over
bills owed by the board.
     ``The MSEB's move has complicated the matter. We did not
expect MSEB to do this,'' Agarwal at IDBI said last week.
     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the board are in
dispute over 3 billion rupees in unpaid bills for December and
January. Others bills through March have been paid.
     The board has refused to pay the December and January bills,
saying they should be lowered to reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty
the board imposed on Dabhol for not supplying power at full
capacity on Jan. 28.
     The dispute Thursday prompted debt-rating company Fitch to
change its outlook on India to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' Fitch
said the climate for foreign investors has deteriorated.
     ``The dispute indicates that India's government may not be
willing to live up to its contractual obligation,'' the Economic
Times quoted Kristin Lindow, India analyst at Moody's Investors
Service, as saying. ``As a consequence, this would further deter
foreign director investment from coming into the country.''
     Moody's and Standard & Poor's have stable outlooks on the
country's sovereign rating. S&P has an investment grade rating of
``BBB'' on the country's sovereign debt. Moody's, like Fitch,
rates India's debt as junk at ``BB2.''



Enron Japan's Hirl on Power Deregulation: Commodity Comment
2001-06-04 06:29 (New York)


     Sydney, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Joseph Hirl, chief executive of
Enron Corp.'s Japanese unit, Enron Japan Corp., comments on the
outlook for deregulation of Japan's electricity industry. He spoke
at the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney.

On Japanese government policy:
     ``The government does have a strong commitment to
deregulation, but there are some significant policy concerns''
including a ``greater than 80 percent reliance on imports'' of
energy.
     ``The market has been open a bit over a year, however not
much has happened. No genuine competition exists under the current
system. The companies there recognize that it will happen. It's
inevitable.
     ``The level of competition in Japan now is similar to the
U.S. in 1994-95, or Europe in 1996-97. Prices are about 400
percent higher than the U.S.
     ``To put it in perspective, I won't give the name of this
large chemical company, but it consumes about 600 megawatts. If
you compare that business with a company that's just like it in
Houston, Texas, the difference would be about $250 million a year
in the cost of electricity.
     ``For such an export-led economy, that's a difficult
situation to be in, and it's contributing to the overall malaise
in the economy.''

On the likelihood of a California-style electricity crisis in
Japan:
     ``Despite exploitation of California by the utilities, METI
(Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and others recognize it
was a problem of design, not competition'' in California.

"RE:","sorry,sorry,sorry 
Yesterday was just a little crazy.  Crude had it's biggest fall in 10 years so that translated into a very busy day.  Plus my best employee was just offered a job across the street for a big chunk of money.  At least I made money. 
I should be getting my phone line at home today (of course they've been saying that for 5 days now) at which point they can install dsl.  Thatll make it much easier.  
Went to the bb game again last night.  Love them stros.  
How'd you're presentation go last night? Did the doc talk good about your drug?
Have a good one,
Jonh

Subject:	Enron EFS issues

Thanks for taking the time to put this PowerPoint presentation together to
better outline the flow. It helps us discuss it internally.

Recently our internal compliance folks have discussed the ""give-up risk"".
Specifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will
accept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients?
There is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to
issues such as credit and the high volatility of NG.

They have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between
Campbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s).  Is this
the SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS?  We are at the point where the
specific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward.  If
we buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance
of the trade for further give-up?  Your legal feedback is welcome.

Thanks,
CDY

good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?

John, here is a power point slide that provides a draft outline of the problem at hand.  It is very draft in nature but I wanted to get the working version over to you ASAP.  I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc....

I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product.

I will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document. 

I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc.

My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto.  I may have an opportunity to build the southeast market by supporting John.

I am very grateful that I met you and other key Enron traders during this job search.

not necessarily looking for predictive power.  that's a 3 year project.  just for market making skillset.  The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias.

John, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject system to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to automate some aspects of you daily activities.  I will try to send you a few power point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.

It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning systems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve building functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with your own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the necessary predictive power.

We got keep the spreads real tight

Nationwide delivieries.

We got to move these molecules

We got to move these electricities.



I shoulda learned to get out on the web

I shoulda learned, they have it hyped in the press

Look at that volume, they are the market share leader

I can't understand why the stock's under distress

And he's 50000 up there, what's that, no nymex noises

Every one wants one, even Dynegy.

Oh, that ain't workin' that's the way you do it

Buyin' for nothin' get your commissions forf ree



I want my, I want my EOL

I want my, I want my EOL

I want my, I want my EOL

"Re: its never gonna break","your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this level though.

John has asked that you place your people only in the desks allotted to you.  Assistants should be colored in white where applicable.  Some teams are still in the same area and changes may not be necessary.  

If all of your commercial organization does not fit, please send me back a list of those people who will need to be assigned a desk on the fifth floor. 

John would like to have a final revision of this by end of day tomorrow (Thursday).

John:
Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in Enron's opinion of:

1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades
2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer?
3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market?

If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you.

From: 	Fraser, Jennifer

To:	Arnold, John
Subject:	FW: Enron Europe Organization Announcement- VOLUNTARY LAYOFFS



Enron has had a very good year to date and we at Enron Europe have played our part in this.   However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.

We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the ""back burner""and reduce the scope of others.

This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.

Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.

We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

Remember that unlike NG, about 90-92% of HO is made on demand -so stocks are not as important. also I think relative to NG HO sotcks are lower in that we are not headed to all time highs lin ho like we are in ng.also EUrope had ver vey warm winter last year.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?

Thanks.
Surprised your shorts are still so confident.  Trade shorts are quickly losing confidence based upon cash, shape of curve, and momentum.  I think curve flattens a little more and then comes down in parallel shift down.
1.  jan and feb are highest storage adjusted prices on curve.  For market area sales, add on basis and dec and march are next.  Question is whether there is enough non-discretionary stg to meet load at other times and in the producing region.  A lot of stg has to come out either for tariff or engineering reasons.  Million dollar question.  
2.  Think Nov bidweek will be weak.  Don't know who baseload buyers are unless trade gets bullish.  Nov is a relatively flat month as far as injections.  stg operators dont have room to buy baseload gas and I think utilities will be planning to meet load using stg.  At current prices, producers apply more pressure to wells, lng doesnt get diverted again, lose some load to resid, lose any momentum of industrial load coming back.  Dont think gas market can handle that.  
3.  No clue.

awesome call on cash.. it does not get any better than that.. you picked the bottom-  i am getting it slowly.. lots of calls today from people i do not speak to every day.. not too much panic from guys who are short.. most looking to put more on.. selling dec01 outright or buying gas daily puts on dec and jan... except pulaski  who pared down dec01 short with us from 4000 to 1000.. do not think he's got on alot elsewhere.  no one has anything on longer dated.. no one can figure out economy...
 
questions:
1. why would any of the discretionary storage operators withdraw gas in the winter based on the current curve?
2. where do you think index gets set this month? i am thinking that utilities will overestimate loads for Nov01 and buy more during bidweek.. index gets set high and depending on Nov weather.. it could come back onto the market weakening cash again..
3. do you have a view on eastern power for the winter? i do not understand the market drivers in the winter.
 
thanks very much,
c

"RE: okay here's what i got on the euro...","I'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gas market wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the short term, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective.

Here is a bio on my Business, Gov't & Int'l Economy prof.  He gave a
presentation on the stuff he did for the European Central Bank the other
day.  He reviewed why historically everyone looks to germany (i.e. Bubba) as
a proxy for determining monetary policy in Europe.  Moreover, he explained
why exchange rates were the focal point in determining monetary policy in
Germany.  With the new ECB, the bank heads are explicitly trying to remove
public focus on exchange rates.  However, this effort may have led to the
belief by the financial community that the ECB does not care about/ will not
defend the euro.  He then stated that this is not true.  So, I'm thinking
that downside is limited.  The performance of the euro has not gone
unnoticed, especially given the critical EU goal of 2% inflation p.a.

Bio:
Huw Pill is an Assistant Professor of Business Administration at the
Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, where he
teaches the first year required MBA course Business, Government and the
International Economy.
Having attended University College, he received an undergraduate degree in
Politics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of Oxford in 1989. He
received his doctorate from the Department of Economics at Stanford
University in June 1995.
From July 1998 until January 2001, Professor Pill was on leave from Harvard
working at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, where he was Head of the
Strategic Policy Issues in the Bank's Directorate Monetary Policy. Prior to
his appointment to the Harvard faculty in July 1995, Professor Pill worked
in London as an economist in the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Group of
the Bank of England's Economics Division (1990-92). He has also worked at
the International Monetary Fund in Washington, DC (1994, 1995).

Professor Pill's current research has two dimensions. On the one hand, he is
investigating the formulation and conduct of monetary policy in advanced
economies, with a focus on the implementation of the single monetary policy
in the euro area. On the other hand, he is studying the role of financial
liberalization and innovation on macroeconomic fluctuations. The latter
project focuses on the interaction between international capital flows,
exchange rate management, structural economic reforms (especially in the
financial sector) and macroeconomic performance in a variety of countries,
including the United Kingdom, Indonesia and Mexico. The results of this
research have been published in various professional journals and edited
volumes.

Colon said he wasn't trying to hit Servais.

"RE:","John:
Here is my analysis of my guys:
Mike Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he has run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the year and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you get killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sold 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july have been really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first half of the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations.  runs low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money in market making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift.  Would like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Required to spend all time in front of computer.  needs to develop John Griffith to allow him to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often has opposite position of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' elses positions.  Vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now.  Cannot function without one of us on the desk.  
Computer causing problems.  will email with other guys later.

I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its

But the most important thing has been my decision to join
Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,

Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if
you know some people in these areas who might be looking

Today. Definitely in the top 10 as far as crappy days go. Started out great.
Breakfast with Dad was nice (LePeep by my house). He was very happy I broke
up with the energy guy. Wasn't too keen on him being Jewish. Dad's pretty
religious in his elder years. Gave me a book of prayers and money....That's
what I'm talkin' about!! (I'm going to he@@). Anyway, my boss calls me as we
are finishing up and asks me if I knew anything about a meeting I was
supposed to be working for NP's (nurse practitioners) at the Westin and I'm
like ""Uh, No...never got the message"". Well, never got the message because
she never sent it. Bottom line, I had to blow off all my plans(I was
actually planning on calling on doctors today and getting ready for my
monday program) and go work this meeting which isn't that big of deal. We
just stand around at display tables and answer questions from the
doctors/NP's. I was there for and hour and then went to lunch. I came back
for an hour and have to do some things here. The good thing about my boss is
she's very ""hand's off"". She stays out of your business unless you call her
for something. She has a life outside of this job which is rare for
managers. The bad thing is she can be ""flighty"" sometimes and forgets to
send things on or lets them pile up and we get the messages a week late
(which is probably what happened in this case)

Anyway, sorry about all the griping but I was on a roll!!

Hope your day has been good. You workin' out or goin' out after work?
Decisions. Decisions. Your gym sounds cool. Laughed at the physique comment.
So something I would have said.

Details are sketchy, once I know I'll pass it on

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative
2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to ""buy- speculative,"" from ""buy-high risk"", to reflect his concerns that ""lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations."" 
""This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,"" he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual."" 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 


Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
""It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,"" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
""We're always willing to sit down with a customer,"" Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
""To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,"" he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
""That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,"" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
""We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,"" Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. 
In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. 
The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. 
Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. 
Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. 
In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 
Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. 
Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. 
States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. 
In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. 
In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. 
Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. 
In major U.S. market action Wednesday: 
Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. 
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E
2001-10-25 12:07 (New York)

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron
Corp. Common Stock

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox
(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and
certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is
brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common
stock of Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,
2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants
engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates
and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial
position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from
the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve
Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an
artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held
positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of
interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these
transactions.

The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants
made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's
Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share
price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never
post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to
make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to
maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.
Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband
business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in
financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing
arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,
its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's
finances from its investors and the market, further artificially
inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially
inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482
million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of
the above practices.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is
represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.  Our firm, with offices
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years of
experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions
involving financial fraud. For more information about Kaplan Fox &
Kilsheimer LLP, you may visit our website at www.kaplanfox.com

order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal
requirements.

              Joe Kernen, what's going on?

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

money flow. i agree that there has been good money flow into us from Japan,
Japan (through Europe), and Europe.  usd is a good safe haven, because if we
have troubles US should outperform, and the EU is untested.  this is why i am
uninterested in shorting the dollar.

the euro has also suffered from a japanese overhang.  when the euro was first
released, japanese bot up the euro with the expectation that other countries
would convert some of their reserves into the euro.  this has not been the case
and japan has been puking out their position.  however, there is a belief that
the selling is over.  (though, i'm not sure when this played out, or how to
check this story.  haven't found measure for money flow.  oh, bloomberg, how i

so, i guess i still like it.  but who knows, i'm probably the mullet retail

"Re: Understanding the natural view","1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor.
2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity.  
3. the obvious
4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall.
5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this winter?


Thanks

John,
 
We have developed a ""morning briefing"" for Gary Hickerson that includes primarily views on the crude and products markets.  Recently, Gary has asked that we include a brief overview on Nat Gas in this packet.  We have worked with Chris Gaskill to get the morning briefing that he puts together for you and your traders and find it very helpful.
 
However, I am interested in going a step further and would like to talk with you or one of your traders on a regular basis in order to get a more trading-centric view on this morning packet.  Specifically, I want to ask the question, ""What do you view as most important in this information"" so we can develop our own ""value added"" information for Gary's group.
 
Is there one of your traders who I might be able to meet with (after market close, of course) to discuss?
 
Thanks, John.
 
Jeff

"Re: Extra credit","rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you $1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?  what you charge me play against you?)

week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

it's going to take complete rejection of phys molecules to get solidly under $3.  i expect some really good chop for 2 weeks.  have enough people waiting for sub $3 to buy back all their shorts...don't think it's that easy from here,.

Subject: EQUITY COMMENTS


Hi- thought you'd want to know some of the recent equity comments from a few of the funds.  Bad comments first.. ENE: Ospraie, one of the Tudor funds has actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our ""credit situation"".  At one point they probably had a 12,000 contract short gas position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now.  They have studied our financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not determine how to value us.. I think the bigger concern though is our credit line situation.  Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is linked to stock price.. obviously the street does not know the real details but the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the contrary are causing some to panic.  I've heard the same come out of SAC which is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short-ENE.  SAC has just started trading with us.
 
I am not sure what to do about this.. luckily Ospraie is the only group commenting on our credit.  I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB- and thats not new.. I have not been able to trade with them for the last year.  I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim.
 
I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest.. and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies (8-10) plus some growth component (5) for developing businesses.  And at $20, they reckon we get taken out anyway.. the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value.
 
Good news- Ospraie covered their short at $30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $4.
 
Other comments from Catequil.. they generally think a lot of the energy sector (E+Ps) are close to bottom.  They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 10.5 PE soon (even though ours is currently 12.5 and they believe in us) because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better.  (Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there).  They were never short us.
 
On other names:
EOG- could see it down to $22 but see $35 based on NAV more realistic.  Like EOG and Chesapeake- well hedged.
 
Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid-east exposure.
 
Like Talisman- only has exposure in Sydan, Nexus- Yemen

"RE: this mkt still sucks","Agree.  Still not at supply/demand equilibrium.  Unfortunately, market lacks a catalyst for sharp move down from here until bid week.  i think continue to see slow erosion.  think we are slowly running out of places to put gas.  discretionary storage guys have their belly full.  can see cash/futures just keep widening from here.  q/v spread, even though it widens every day, still has a long way to go.  think you get to V and there is nowhere to put the gas.  could see v/x going to 30+.  i buy every cantango spread i can.  when market moves up the winter goes 1 for 1, when the market goes down you make money.  strongest product in the gas market are nymex futures.  everything else is a bloodbath.  socal basis has gone from $10 to $4 in the past month.  canadian storage balances are ridiculous.  imports are going to blow away last year.   new lng coming in late novy.  rig count is like open interest, a straight line up.  gas is behaving very price inelastic, just like it did on the move from $3 to $5 last year.  see little hope.  
h/j is the craziest spread on the board.  it is not a fundamentally priced spread though.  for several reasons, the industry uses that spread primarily to link the front of the board to the back.  think the front will keep drifting lower and the back will find some customer buy support as we get cal 2 down to 3.75 ish.  thus, h/j has to come in...i think.  plus i have the fundamentals on my side.

not much change for me john-i dont see much hope from the bull side. a hot
summer at this pt only delays my bearishness further. its 3.1 tcf most
bullish end oct or 3.4 if we're not hot for the rest of summer. either way
says its all too high priced.
   now what the hell is up w/bo buying those H/J?? to me this one is looking
a little like the aug/oct(remember how stupid that was at +5 cts. h/j maybe
not that redicuous but almost. at what pt will the mkt/world give up on the
winter strip and h/j gets back to a more reasonalbe 15 cts like jan/feb and
feb/mar?
   mkt seems to be treating you well. still pluggin along here. so far so
good. but im pretty much unwavering in my bearish conviction-think its still
down and maybe below 3 bucks and much more-always the problem of how much
wip you have to take in the short term.
    our cust stuff on the buy side has finally cooled off as all those guys
hedged over 5.00. industrial sectors still suffering from bad bad margins as
the chemical biz sucks due to imports,ammonia  and metals biz sucks.resid
prices will help a little but if we have 2 bcf/day more supply y on y then
there is no hope.
be cool-regards,

Elizabet Soto
Errol McLaughlin
Frnak Hayden
George Huan
Greg Couch
Joey Taylor
Kori Loibl

I am going to let all of these people know that beginning 7/1/01 the daily lunches will go back to being for the traders only due to cost and time.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's

custy interest from sell side?  or buy? 
 
sounds like the producers are pretty hedged?
 
what do you think of the fact that production is disappointing?
 
that fact is keeping some from selling more (my guys).. but i argue that its already priced into the curve.. and economic outlook overwhelms..

there are a few things going on.. the client is long cy02/short cy03 socal.. and the deal last week impacts that position.. thats their interest.
 
our interest is whether or not there are more of these deals coming.. which i was trying to figure out.

Subject: FW: NG deal in California



sorry not to send this earlier..

i checked out the dept water resources site.. (wwwowe.water.ca.gov).. nothing too illuminating except that their power costs have come down from over $300 in march to$45 this month but due to the nature the borrowing costs associated with the LT contracts, they will not be able to pass on much savings to consumers (gotta love that).

we were supposed to have received a copy of all their LT purchases in July. checking what happened there.  we know that there were 54 contracts signed .. half linked to gas which covered 1/3 of cali's total needs (looks like for 10 years).  some left open the possibility of the state procuring gas supplies for the plants.. dwr has signed 6 agreements w/ gas suppliers..pretty sure cali uses 25,000-45,000 MW per year which is about 70 contracts a day in gas terms.  If they locked in 1/3.. it would be about 25/day.. the deal they just did was about 16/day for just cal02..probably waiting for curve to flatten further to do more..

they purchased another 500 MW in Aug - the 17th (all 10-12 years)..and to date it looks like they have not purchased anything (have been selling into the grid daily) but not liquidating any previously negotiated LT deals (LT is anything beyond 3 months).

it sounds like they are planning on buying more of their gas requirements.. Sempra (who has LT power contracts with DWR and gives them the ability to buy 80% of their gas) said DWR had not purchased any gas yet.

 

 

Pls note story on page 5 & 6 of todays gas daily... 

mentions California Dept of Water looking to hedge gas purchases for long-term contracts. 

over the past few days we have seen Major Inv. Bk Buying  Cal 02 Nymex Calls and the same bank buying Cal 02 Socal basis calls - very good size

This, we believe, is a hedge for this DWR story. The article mentions that they were ""looking at ways to expand its gas purchases"".

The article does not mention, nor do we know, how far out they are looking to purchase. 

Socal basis has moved on the back of this deal.... 
Last week: 
Cal 02 = 9 cents    Cal 03 = 20 cents 

Today 
Cal 02 = 18.5 cents   Cal 03 = 22 cents....so the spread has moved from 11 cent  contango  to 3.5 cents. 

<<102401.pdf>> 

Other than the call buying we saw related to this deal, the rest of the flow we are seeing is : sellers of vol. 
Last night settles: 
Cal 02 vol  51.5% and Cal 03 vol 37.25% - and we are 1 % lower in Cal 02 since the open , and 0.5 % lower Cal 03.

Thanks for taking the time to put this PowerPoint presentation together to
better outline the flow. It helps us discuss it internally.

Recently our internal compliance folks have discussed the ""give-up risk"".
Specifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will
accept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients?
There is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to
issues such as credit and the high volatility of NG.

They have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between
Campbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s).  Is this
the SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS?  We are at the point where the
specific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward.  If
we buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance
of the trade for further give-up?  Your legal feedback is welcome.

Thanks,
CDY

replace it with a third party Enron may have offsetting transactions with.

our position would allow us to accommodate the following transactions:

last day swaps from Enron and selling to a third party
Buying sixteen and a half (16.5) contracts a day January 2002 through
December 2002 (F02-Z02) natural gas last day swaps from Enron and selling to
a third party
Buying four (4) contracts a day April 2003 through October 2003 (J03-V03)
natural gas last day swaps from Enron and selling to a third party
Buying two (2) contracts a day January 2004 through December 2008 (F04-Z08)

no, the opposite.  saying price drop hasnt brought us closer to equilibrium.  we absolutley cant continue this loss of demand, otherwise we end up at 3.2 and the industry doesnt want to /cant end up there.   thus you must pick up at least some demand.  price must keep dropping .   price dropped $1.5 and haven't gained any demand.  that's the scary thing.  how much does it have to drop before we do find it?

        cost about 200,000-300,000 

        our internal estimates were in the 102-106 range, so no.  i think pira overestimating the gas gen burn for the week.  problem is there is no real good burn for at least two weeks going forward.  we've dropped $1.5 in a couple months and havent picked up an mmbtu of demand.  that's a big problem

flat price me thinks we go nowhere for a while. think the next push down doesnt come again until late october.  im buying z 300/250 put spread for 11.  still looking for 3.1 by end of season.  probably 2.95-3.0 for nov 31.  who wants baseload gas for dec in that scenario?
aga's... think high 70's is neutral the market.  if it comes out 70-85 you can shit on vol.  that'd be good for me.

dont blame you-but my long straddle position worked great(30 vols in one
day-sorry im sure it was a tuff day for you hedged my merc short well). im
gonna try again this time altho at higher vol levels(bot some from magee). i
think if we get a aga less than 70 or more than 80 well see a big move.more
a gamma play this time.flat price im pretty neutral till i see the aga.
number shud come in around 81-82 ish but after last week who the hell knows.
im not bullish by eany means but the s&d has titened a bit on a relative
basis. if i dont see 80 ish injections ill be neutral and be trading more
short term and opportunistic than previous.
  man the enron stx getting smoked-they better pay you more cash this year

John,

Thanks for getting back with me...and according to the article in the
Houston Chronicle you are the #1 guy there, so I can see why there would
not be a need to look...how does the merger with Dynegy affect you
guys...is there going to be a shakeout ?  Also if you could take a guess
are there allot of companies in Houston aggressively hiring experienced
traders now or has it slowed...?

Thanks again and continued success....

John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within Enron North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Julie

Hi Julie. I noticed the contracts have been received.  However, ""North America""
has been crossed off the contract. That is the name it was signed under and
still the current trading name for Emissions and Natural gas. Not sure if it
was a mistake or not. Anyway - please get back to me when you can. I am going
to try to set up a meeting with the gas guys for tomorrow 4/17. Thanks

Subject:	Enron EFS issues

Thanks for taking the time to put this PowerPoint presentation together to
better outline the flow. It helps us discuss it internally.

Recently our internal compliance folks have discussed the ""give-up risk"".
Specifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will
accept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients?
There is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to
issues such as credit and the high volatility of NG.

They have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between
Campbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s).  Is this
the SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS?  We are at the point where the
specific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward.  If
we buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance
of the trade for further give-up?  Your legal feedback is welcome.

Thanks,
CDY

         The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we
         received
         today.

         Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August
   03
         position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02
      futures.

         If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and
      734
         May
         02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other
   of

Don
How are you today? I hope all is well. Due to the job commitments of the SME's, they can not attend a 4 hour kick off meeting. Therefore, we need to cut it down to 1.5 to 2 hours. Send me the agenda with some detail regarding the purpose of the different sections on the agenda. I know as a minimum I want the following to occur at this meeting

1. Demo simulation
2. Duties & responsibilities of SME/The processes associated with these tasks (i.e. questions, interviews meetings)
3. Give out the first set of questions to SME's and get the show started
4. Go over time lines and milestones associated with SME's duties and responsibilities.

Now I know the content review sessions have been estimated to last approximately 4 hours, but we should be able to give the SME's advance notice and schedule them individually. Together with them we can address this issue and obtain a win win solution (i.e. cut down the time with a great process and commitments to Excellence).

We need to get started on this deal. I need to get 100% attendance by the SME's.


Give me a call on my cell phone 713 303 4292 or leave me a detail message on my work phone (My cell is off while I am at the Hospital w/ my mother).

Cheers
KIrk

	In this case, the answer is yes to all three, so I don't care.  If the answer is no to one or more of the above, a judgment call has to be made.

John--

      I am a summer analyst working with Laura Luce in the central gas desk.
      We are trying to assemble a client-based website which will be used to provide assorted information material to the natrual gas industry to specifically targeted Enron clients.  In so doing, we are trying to gather as much information as possible without crossing lines of propriety.  One of the issues which has come up recently is whether we would be allowed to post next month and/or year-out volatility data.  The data would be posted to a password protected site, but it would be on the extranet.  Chris Gaskill, who is generally our local authority on issues of propriety has suggested that this would ultimately be your decision.  Any comments on the propriety of exposing these volatility curves would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

	In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,
and so on.

	The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

	Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

	As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

	$______ per/share

hi.. just so you know exactly what happened here..

ospraie sold us a 4.70 swaption.. exercisable into a swap.. expiry 3/27/01.. 5/month cal02 
on 3/27/01.. market close is 4.78.. 
we called Mike Maggi.. asked if he was exercising swap.. yes, he was 
we asked if we had to do anything in the system.... no was the reply. 
we call ospraie.. tell them we exercised the swap. 
reconciling position report with ospraie for the hundreth time this month.. notice we are out 5/month on swaps... we had not previously been pulling deals from the system... just going by deal tickets. 
we go through system for a week.. can not find deal.. that is where we are now. 
deal needs to be found or recreated.

 
if you have some time (or if you like slow torture).. read my other note.. 
better news coming.. promise.

Errol- A swap between Enron and Tudor for Cal02 at 4.70 must be booked as soon as we figure out that there is no possibility it is in the system.
 
Derek/Michelle- this deal not being included in the system should be throwing off Ospraie's MTM.  This swap is at 4.70.. they are short 60 contracts..currently Cal02 is around $3.. which should result in $1M more positive P&L for Ospraie and $1M less for us.  
 
This must be settled first thing Monday.

John,
 
We have developed a ""morning briefing"" for Gary Hickerson that includes primarily views on the crude and products markets.  Recently, Gary has asked that we include a brief overview on Nat Gas in this packet.  We have worked with Chris Gaskill to get the morning briefing that he puts together for you and your traders and find it very helpful.
 
However, I am interested in going a step further and would like to talk with you or one of your traders on a regular basis in order to get a more trading-centric view on this morning packet.  Specifically, I want to ask the question, ""What do you view as most important in this information"" so we can develop our own ""value added"" information for Gary's group.
 
Is there one of your traders who I might be able to meet with (after market close, of course) to discuss?
 
Thanks, John.

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  (storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not convinced this rally in products is different.

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last [Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. Normally ""False""


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

		       INPUTS		         OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula #	Intensity			Spread	Offset  Suspension
S1		>220			-0.01	n/a	F
S2		<30			+0.01	n/a	F
S3		<10			+0.02	n/a	F

Transaction Formula
Formula #	# Transactions		Spread	Offset  Suspension
V1		<4			n/a	-0.01	F
V2		>3			n/a	+0.01	F
V3		>5			+0.01	+0.02	F
V4		>10			+0.02	+0.04	F
V5		>15			+0.04	+0.15	F
V6		>20			n/a	n/a	T
				
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction, please see the attached:

 


Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

John -- 

I appreciate your allowing us to use your enclosed office for Ken Lay video applications.  In testing the equipment today, I realized for the first time that our fiber feed involved that big black box that you've undoubtedly noticed.  I was unaware that that would be necessary.  We really view this as temporary because we are planning to move all video activity to the new building before the end of the year.  However, if you would prefer, I can request to have the box moved out and a fixture put in your wall. 

Thanks again, John.

We CAN help America TODAY

No doubt you have heard dire predictions about the financial devastation
that will occur when the US stock market re-opens. This will be a second
devastating attack on America if we allow it to happen.

We DON'T have to allow it to happen. Here's what YOU can do to help
prevent
it...

When the markets re-open, in a show of support and solidarity, BUY at
least one share of stock in a U.S. company.

Open your minds to imagine what a SLAP in the face of terrorism it would
be if the American  markets actually RISE instead of PLUNGE when they
re-open!

Can you think of a STRONGER message we could send to those who would
seek to destroy our way of life?

This e-mail is sponsored by noone, so if you also have a
suggestion for people without stock accounts, please add that information
before you forward this e-mail.

If we all participate in a massive stock selloff, then we are BOWING
to terrorism. We do NOT have to do that. We have a choice.

People by the hundreds of thousands are lining up to donate one pint
of blood. Think of the effect  we can have if we line up in the same way
to contribute to the American economy!

For very little money you can DO something to show would-be terrorists
that they will NOT win.

                         YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

Take part in this revolution and forward this e-mail to everyone on your
mailing list. We can reverse the tide of the finanical carnage throughout
the world just by doing that.

Do you want to show support for America? Then show support for American
companies.

WHEN THE US MARKETS RE-OPEN, BUY AT LEAST ONE SHARE OF STOCK IN A U.S
COMPANY.

Imagine the headlines we will read when we all make this happen...

""US Financial Victory -- Of the People, By the People, and For the
People.""

   today.

   Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
   position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02 futures.

   If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and 734

   those

Subject: FW: NG deal in California



sorry not to send this earlier..

i checked out the dept water resources site.. (wwwowe.water.ca.gov).. nothing too illuminating except that their power costs have come down from over $300 in march to$45 this month but due to the nature the borrowing costs associated with the LT contracts, they will not be able to pass on much savings to consumers (gotta love that).

we were supposed to have received a copy of all their LT purchases in July. checking what happened there.  we know that there were 54 contracts signed .. half linked to gas which covered 1/3 of cali's total needs (looks like for 10 years).  some left open the possibility of the state procuring gas supplies for the plants.. dwr has signed 6 agreements w/ gas suppliers..pretty sure cali uses 25,000-45,000 MW per year which is about 70 contracts a day in gas terms.  If they locked in 1/3.. it would be about 25/day.. the deal they just did was about 16/day for just cal02..probably waiting for curve to flatten further to do more..

they purchased another 500 MW in Aug - the 17th (all 10-12 years)..and to date it looks like they have not purchased anything (have been selling into the grid daily) but not liquidating any previously negotiated LT deals (LT is anything beyond 3 months).

it sounds like they are planning on buying more of their gas requirements.. Sempra (who has LT power contracts with DWR and gives them the ability to buy 80% of their gas) said DWR had not purchased any gas yet.

 

 

Pls note story on page 5 & 6 of todays gas daily... 

mentions California Dept of Water looking to hedge gas purchases for long-term contracts. 

over the past few days we have seen Major Inv. Bk Buying  Cal 02 Nymex Calls and the same bank buying Cal 02 Socal basis calls - very good size

This, we believe, is a hedge for this DWR story. The article mentions that they were ""looking at ways to expand its gas purchases"".

The article does not mention, nor do we know, how far out they are looking to purchase. 

Socal basis has moved on the back of this deal.... 
Last week: 
Cal 02 = 9 cents    Cal 03 = 20 cents 

Today 
Cal 02 = 18.5 cents   Cal 03 = 22 cents....so the spread has moved from 11 cent  contango  to 3.5 cents. 

<<102401.pdf>> 

Other than the call buying we saw related to this deal, the rest of the flow we are seeing is : sellers of vol. 
Last night settles: 
Cal 02 vol  51.5% and Cal 03 vol 37.25% - and we are 1 % lower in Cal 02 since the open , and 0.5 % lower Cal 03.

You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you

Furthermore, the EOL log I get says that the order was valid until 10:57:13

Just a followup to our phone call earlier this morning.   Have begun to see short-term intraday topping patterns.   Natural has reached its mid-range of price objectives.  See no rationale  for holding significant length here.  Winter months seem especially high  and most vulnerable to correction.  The first hour's negative close  produced a sell signal against today's high.  Still too early to ascertain  if this is the end of entire up move.  Have targets into early next week,  but mkt. has reached where it needed to.

Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.

Dear Mr. Arnold:

I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student at
Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring potential
employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am interested in
derivatives trading.

I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
professional experience has been in a variety of roles within financial
institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk, before
starting my MBA.

I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of your
colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston or NYC
areas in the next few months.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

I assumed you knew the details but just realized from talking to Jay that you probably were not aware that Greg Whalley wanted us to put this on hold for North America until some FERC and CFTC issues were resolved. John Lavorato however wanted to go ahead and have an internal only version and we needed an extra week to program the internal only restricted version. Given that we have an intenal only version we don't need to conduct the test we had spoken about before. Let me know if you need further information. Thanks.

   The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we

   today.

   Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
   position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02 futures.

   If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and 734

   02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other of
   those

Do you remember Jim Paul from Carr?  He kept calling me about setting up a margin line for you to trade on and eventually we decided that it was not a good idea for Enron.  He visited me in Houston with a large team of people on the subject.  I called Credit Agricole (owner of Carr) in Houston and sadly it is feared that he did not make it out from the World Trade Center.

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

S&P Lowers Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust Ratings; On Watch Neg

11/07/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

NEW YORK, Nov. 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard & Poor's today lowered its ratings on Enron Credit Linked Notes Trusts' credit linked notes and placed them on CreditWatch with negative implications (see list). 
The lowered ratings reflect the Nov. 1, 2001 rating action taken on Enron Corp., which was based on Standard & Poor's belief that Enron's plan to employ asset sales and other means to repair its damaged balance sheet will be insufficient to restore its long-term credit quality to the historical triple-'B'-plus level. The CreditWatch placements recognize the uncertainties that surround the company and its credit quality in the short run due to the possibility of further unanticipated developments in the capital markets.
These synthetic issues utilize a credit default swap that references Enron's senior unsecured debt and therefore the rating on the credit-linked notes will reflect the current senior unsecured rating of Enron. OUTSTANDING RATINGS LOWERED AND PLACED ON CREDITWATCH NEGATIVE

DJ CNBC's FABER REPORT: Enron/Dynegy Deal Talk
2001-11-07 14:56 (New York)


  The following is a transcript of a report aired Wednesday by CNBC reporter
David Faber: 
 
  Enron is in discussions with Dynegy about a range of options that include a
merger of the two companies. 

  While such an outcome is only one of a number of options being discussed,
sources close to the talks tell me such an outcome is being considered. 
  Enron is trying to raise equity capital and restore confidence amid the
complete collapse of its stock price. 

  Today, the Houston-based energy trading concern's shares have fallen another
25%, while its bonds, perhaps a better barometer of the market's concerns about
credit quality, have shed roughly ten points. 

  Enron will not comment. But sources close to the situation tell me the
company continues to speak with a handful of private equity firms about an
investment. Those talks are still in the early stages. 
  Talks with Dynegy, a cross-town rival of Enron's that also markets and trades
energy, have progressed at a faster pace. 

  Dynegy is unlike Enron in that it owns more hard assets, many of which came
along with the acquisition of Illnova, completed in 2000. 
  While many potential acquirers have shied away from Enron due to continued
concern about unknown liabilities the company may have, Dynegy is very familiar
with its energy trading business. 

  Dynegy is the number two player in the U.S. energy trading market and would
clearly become the dominant player were it to merge with or acquire Enron. A
Dynegy spokesman declined comment. 

  While Dynegy has off-balance sheet financings that are similar to Enron's,
those financings are not guaranteed by the parent. 
  It is such guarantees that have concerned Enron investors along with a series
of questionable investments. 

  Given the massive decline in Enron's stock price, Dynegy now has a market
value that is twice that of Enron. 

  That decline in Enron's stock price would make any equity infusion heavily
dilutive, if private equity firms were to choose to invest in Enron they would
likely do so in the form of a security that converted to equity and paid a
dividend. 

  Still, because Enron now has a market value of only $5.3 billion, the roughly
$2 billion it may want represents an enormous percentage of its overall equity
value. 

  Hence, discussion with Dynegy may have taken on the form of a merger, rather
than a strategic investment. 
 


Enron in Talks With Dynegy That May Include Merger, CNBC Says
2001-11-07 13:39 (New York)


     Houston, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is talking with
rival energy company Dynegy Inc. about a number of options,
including merger, to help it raise equity capital and restore
confidence, financial news network CNBC reported.
     Spokesmen for Dynegy and Enron declined to comment.



WSJ: Dynegy In Talks To Put About $2B Into Enron Now
By Robin Sidel

Of The Wall Street Journal 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) is in advanced discussions to infuse about $2 billion into Enron Corp. (ENE) in a transaction that may lead to a full-blown merger between the two companies, sources familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.
A formal transaction could be unveiled as early as Thursday, these people said. The situation is very fluid and is subject to change, these people noted. 
(This report and related background will be available at the Journals' Web site, WSJ.com.) 
Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral. 
Enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected. Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up. 
Enron shares recently traded down $1.57, or 16%, at $8.10. -Robin Sidel; The Wall Street Journal; 212-274-7991

Enron Shares Fall on Concern About Finding Investors (Update2)

Enron Shares Fall on Concern About Finding Investors (Update2)

     (Adds CNBC report on talks with Dynegy in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell as
much as 28 percent, to their lowest level in more than a decade,
amid reports that the No. 1 energy trader is struggling to find
investors to help it out of a cash crunch.

     Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 12 percent, to $8.50 in
midafternoon trading. The shares dropped to $7 earlier. At
yesterday's close, they had fallen 88 percent this year.

     Enron will have a hard time raising a large amount of cash in
a short time, said Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones
Rating Co.

     ``It takes time to sell assets, and many shrewd investors
like Goldman Sachs might find it more profitable to just pluck off
key employees rather than invest in Enron,'' Egan said.

     The shares pared some of today's losses after CNBC reported
that Enron is talking with rival Dynegy Inc. about options,
including a merger. Both companies are based in Houston.

     ``We don't comment on market rumors,'' Dynegy spokesman Steve
Stengel said.

     ``Enron does not comment on speculation on mergers and
acquisitions,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffett decided
against investing in Enron because he wasn't willing to sign a
confidentiality agreement that would keep him from trading Enron's
debt, the New York Times reported today, citing an unidentified
person close to the talks.

     Other companies approached by Enron, including Clayton
Dubilier & Rice, the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
& Co. have also shown little interest, the newspaper said.

     The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
Enron partnerships run by the company's former chief financial
officer. The entities bought and sold Enron shares and assets,
with trades costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost
shareholder equity. Enron ousted CFO Andrew Fastow last month.

                         Rating Downgraded

     Standard & Poor's today reduced its rating on Enron's credit-
linked notes, just six days after the ratings company downgraded
Enron's senior unsecured bonds. S&P cut four Enron credit-linked
issues valued at about $1.36 billion combined to ``BBB'' from
``BBB+'' and indicated it may lower the grades again.

     Fearing that an Enron collapse might cripple the natural gas-
derivatives market, oil and gas producer Apache Corp. said it
backed out of most of its gas hedges, realizing a $70 million gain
so far.

     ``We have been unwinding our hedge positions because of
uncertainty created by Enron's credit problems,'' Apache spokesman
Bill Mintz said. The company now has only one position with Enron
that it's trying to unwind.

     The Apache news was reported earlier by the Times.

                        `Fragile Business'

     ``Their trading business is a very fragile business,'' Egan
said. ``If partners on either side get concerned, trading volumes
decline, which is what is happening now.''

     Other companies mentioned in reports as possible buyers of
all or part of Enron have denied an interest in the idea. General
Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt told CNN today
that ``Enron's really not on our list right now.'' BP Plc Chief
Executive John Browne said ``no'' at a press conference in London
yesterday when asked whether the London-based company would be
interested in buying Enron or a stake in the company.

     Among shares of other energy traders, Dynegy fell $1.70 to
$34.30. Mirant Corp. fell 15 cents to $25.40. Williams Cos. fell 4
cents to $28.97.

Enron Credit-Linked Note Ratings Reduced 6 Days Late (Update2)

     (Adds background and stock price in fourth through sixth
paragraphs.)

     New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Standard & Poor's Corp.
downgraded notes linked to Enron Corp.'s credit quality to match
the No. 1 energy trader's credit rating six days after the ratings
company reduced its corporate debt ratings.

     S&P said it cut four Enron credit-linked notes, valued at
$1.36 billion, to ``BBB'' from ``BBB+'', and indicated it may
lower the grades again.

     ``This isn't an additional downgrade and should have happened
last week,'' said Todd Shipman, a director at the ratings company
that follows the company. Last week Shipman downgraded Enron's
long-term ratings to ``BBB'' from ``BBB+,'' and left them on watch
for a further downgrade.

     Enron shares today fell as much as 28 percent, to their
lowest level in more than a decade, amid reports that the No. 1
energy trader is struggling to find investors to help it out of a
cash crunch.

     Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 12 percent, to $8.50 in mid-
afternoon trading. The shares dropped to $7 earlier. At
yesterday's close, they had fallen 88 percent this year.

     The federal Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating Enron partnerships run by the company's former chief
financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was ousted last month. The
entities bought and sold Enron shares and assets,
with trades costing Enron $35 million and $1.2 billion in lost
shareholder equity.

                               Notes

     Holders of the credit-linked notes, sold by Enron Euro CLN
Trust, Enron Sterling CLN Trust, and Enron CLN Trust and Trust II,
may have received a higher coupon than an Enron corporate
obligation offers. The notes, which are obligations of the special
purpose entities, are tied to specific credit events, such as a
bankruptcy or Enron's failure to pay on obligations.

     Proceeds from the notes were to be used to acquire the
Trusts' initial investments, and buyers are to be paid interest
from the proceeds of those certain assets, according to an
offering memorandum. The Trusts can invest in securities with
short-term ratings of at least ``A1'' from S&P and ``P1'' from
Moody's Investors Service, as long as they mature before the
maturity dates of the notes.

     There are four notes, each divided into two offerings, some
offered publicly and some privately sold. All the notes are
scheduled to mature in August 2005 or May 2006 and were sold by a
group of banks led by Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.

     In the event of an Enron credit event, Citibank, which acted
as a swap counter-party to the trusts, can take the trusts'
investments in return for Enron debt obligations. The Enron debt
is then liquidated by the trust, with the proceeds paid to the
investors.

     Neither Enron nor Citibank have direct obligations to the
holders of the notes, according to an offering memorandum.

     Enron's credit-linked notes utilize a credit-default swap
that the trusts have with Citibank that references Enron's senior
unsecured debt, so the rating on the credit-linked notes will
reflect the senior unsecured rating, S&P said in a report.

Former SEC Chairman Levitt (Transcript of Interview)
2001-11-07 12:52 (New York)


     ****THE FOLLOWING IS AN UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT.****
BLOOMBERG L.P. DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THIS
TRANSCRIPT.

     New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a
transcript of a Bloomberg interview with Former Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt.  The
reporter is Dylan Ratigan.

     RATIGAN:  As you've probably heard, Enron under
investigation by the SEC, the SEC looking into partnerships
run by their former CFO.  If you come into the Bloomberg
with me, I want to show you what it's done to the stock
price here over the course of the past month, month and a
half.  You're talking about a move from a price in the mid
40s, which was not that long ago, mind you, early mid-
October, to a price that is now $9.67 a share.  This has
absolutely decimated the company's stock price.  Arthur
Levitt, the former chairman of the SEC, with us, looking,
first of all, at what's going on with this company.

     But, before I do that, let me say good morning to you.

     LEVITT:  Good morning, Dylan.

     RATIGAN:  Talk to me.

     LEVITT:  You know, there are certain warning signs here
that investors have to be careful of:  related party
transactions.  Anytime you see a related party transaction,
an investor should be very careful.  What they were doing,
was they were simply setting up these partnerships to move
off the balance sheet acquisitions and borrowings that would
really have hurt the balance sheet and I think given
investors a very different picture.

     RATIGAN:  Well, let's just make it real clear to
people, because they can easily get confused.  I'm a
company.

     LEVITT:  Yes.

     RATIGAN:  .and I create - and I'm an executive of that
company, and I create a partnership that has nothing to do
with that company, legally, on paper.

     LEVITT:  But all the risks and rewards still belong to
the parent company.  The affect of this is the subsidiary
borrows the money to make the acquisition from another
partnership set up by the parent. This stays totally off the
balance sheet of the parent company.  Why does this happen?

     RATIGAN:  So, in other words, Company ABC exists, they
set up Subsidiary 123.

     LEVITT:  Yes.

     RATIGAN:  Subsidiary company 123 borrows money from.

     LEVITT:  To make an acquisition.

     RATIGAN:  A bank?

     LEVITT:  No.

     RATIGAN:  They borrow money from who?

     LEVITT:  They issue bonds.

     RATIGAN:  OK.  They borrow money from the world.

     LEVITT:  Yes.

     RATIGAN:  . whoever wants to lend them money.

     LEVITT:  Yes.

     RATIGAN:  . they borrow money, they make an
acquisition.  Now Subsidiary 123 down here has big debts
that don't reflect upstairs on Company ABC?

     LEVITT:  Precisely.

     RATIGAN:  But ABC still gets to use the asset that was
bought by 123?

     LEVITT:  Yes.

     RATIGAN:  OK.

     LEVITT:  Exactly.  Now, how does it happen?  The
accounting firm that handled this transaction, Arthur
Andersen, received $25 million for an audit of the company -
that's a huge amount - and $27 million for consulting
services - another danger sign.  A lot of dough.  Those
consulting services were to validate these transactions; $52
million dollars went to the accountants.  The problem here
is an audit committee was not doing its work.  If you look
at Enron's statements - and how many times have we heard
they were confusing?  It's the job of the auditing firm to
see to it that it is not confusing.  That's the real
problem.  Now, what can you do about it?

     RATIGAN:  Tell me.

     LEVITT:  I think, actually, the FASB, the independent
standards setter, could put through a rule, which says.

     RATIGAN:  And FASB is the Federal Accounting Standards
Board.  They set the rules.

     LEVITT:  Yes.  Located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  They
could say, if a company sets up another legal entity, and
the company retains all the risks and rewards of that
entity, then the public company, that public company that
set up these entities, must consolidate in the P&L, in the
balance sheet, all of these transactions.

     Now, how does that come about?  I think the SEC could
urge the FASB to do this.  In 1990, the present chief
accountant of the SEC called for that action to be taken
place, but at that point, the then-chief accountant didn't
support the move.

     RATIGAN:  And this creates, in your mind, a rallying
call to reiterate that request with more venom and more
passion than before?

     LEVITT:  I don't know about venom, but I.

     RATIGAN:  But with passion.

     LEVITT:  I certainly think that passion - I think this
is clearly a call for better disclosure.

     RATIGAN:  Fair enough.  I will see you next week, OK?

     LEVITT:  Good.  Nice to see you.

     RATIGAN:  You, too.

USA: U.S. FERC watching Enron's impact on energy markets.

11/07/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is watching what effect Enron Corp.'s financial problems may have on interstate electricity and natural gas markets, FERC chairman Pat Wood said on Wednesday. 
However, Wood said FERC does not have a direct role in the ongoing federal investigation of the company.
""We're watching the impact that Enron or any other firm would have on the overall workings of the market, but we're not intervening where other agencies have jurisdiction,"" Wood told reporters during a briefing after the agency's regular meeting. 
Enron, the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, is under attack for failing to explain off-balance sheet transactions that led to a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity. 
The deals, conducted with partnerships run by ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Apache Unwinds Most Gas Hedges; Cites Enron Uncertainty
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Over the last few days, Apache Corp. (APA) has unwound nearly all of its hedges on natural-gas prices due to concerns about what would happen to the marketplace for energy derivatives if Enron Corp. (ENE) collapsed. 
According to Tony Lentini, a spokesman for the Houston natural-gas producer, many of the hedges were established to lock in the value of acquisitions the company made.
Apache unwound all but one hedge, a transaction that involved Enron and other parties, Lentini said. 
Apache has a gain of about $70 million from the various transactions, but the company hasn't determined yet how the gain will be accounted for in its financial results, the spokesman said. 
Apache has been an outspoken critic of the merchant energy trading because of the company's perception that the system is underregulated and creates excessive energy price volatility.

USA: Enron shares fall below $8 - set new nine-year low.

11/07/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. fell in a new round of selling on Wednesday that set new nine-year lows, amid concerns about the energy trading giant's ability to raise cash. 
The company's stock slid $1.77, or 18.3 percent, to $7.90 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, diving below $8 for the first time since February 1992. The shares are down almost 77 percent since the company released its earnings results on Oct. 16, which set off the recent tumble.
The issues that have plagued the Houston-based company over the past three weeks continue to weigh on it, according to Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons and Co. 
""It's a bit of a vicious cycle,"" he said. ""The stock price declines, credit concerns go up, counterparties attempt to reduce their exposure and the earnings power of the company deteriorates."" 
He added that Enron needs to ""get all its ducks in a row"" so that it can meet with the holders of its stocks and bonds to discuss issues such as the company's capitalization and plans for strengthening its balance sheet. 
Enron, the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, is under attack for failing to explain off-balance sheet transactions that led to a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity. 
The deals, conducted with partnerships run by ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron's stock drops 25 percent

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s stock price continued its free fall Wednesday as shares fell 25 percent to a new 10-year low amid reports the company was having trouble attracting a large investor to allay worries about its financial health and restore confidence. 
Shares of the largest U.S. natural gas and power marketer dropped dlrs 2.41 to dlrs 7.26 in midday trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Enron has been rebuffed by more than a dozen buyout firms as well as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing a person close to the talks. 
Houston-based Enron's stock is off more than 79 percent since Oct. 16, when the company said shareholder equity had been reduced by dlrs 1.2 billion, in part due to partnerships managed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
At the same time, reported a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss last month, dragged down by a one-time charge of dlrs 1.01 billion attributed to various losses. Fastow was ousted a week later. 
The company's financial stability was further weakened after the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry, which was upgraded to a formal investigation, of the partnerships and possible conflicts of interest resulting from them. 
On Tuesday, Jeff Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, testified before the SEC in Washington D.C. 
Enron's woes have prompted speculation about a possible takeover of the company. Some of the potential buyers that have been mentioned include General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch Shell. 
GE Capital has not ruled out an investment, the Times said, citing a source close to the talks. 
Enron has cashed in about dlrs 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence. 
Last week, Enron secured dlrs 1 billion in new financing, using some of its natural gas and pipeline assets as collateral. 
Enron officials said Tuesday seeking additional financing is one of the many options the company is exploring to firm up investor and market confidence. 
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's Corp. on Wednesday lowered its ratings on some of Enron's credit linked notes and placed them on CreditWatch. S-and-P said Enron's plan to repair its damaged balance sheet through asset sales and other means will be insufficient. 
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Inc. have also downgraded the company's credit ratings. 
Last week, Enron announced it created a special committee headed by University of Texas law school dean William Powers to respond to the SEC investigation. Powers also was elected to Enron's board of directors.

Rabin & Peckel LLP Commences Class Action Against Enron Corporation and Certain of Its Officers and Directors, Alleging Violations of Federal Securities Laws

11/07/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 7, 2001--A class action complaint has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Enron Corporation (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE) common stock between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The complaint was brought against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The case is numbered H-01-3736. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge presiding over the case. 
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.
On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. When this news hit the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. 
Plaintiff is represented by the law firm of Rabin & Peckel LLP. Rabin & Peckel LLP and its predecessor firms have devoted its practice to shareholder class actions and complex commercial litigation for more than thirty years and have recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for shareholders in class actions throughout the United States.

Enron's power company in India calls off Singapore meeting after Indian lenders file lawsuit
By SATISH NANDGAONKAR

BOMBAY, India (AP) - Enron Corp.'s Indian power unit canceled a meeting with four Indian creditors after they filed a lawsuit against the company and three other parties on Wednesday to demand that the energy project resume operations. 
The two-day meeting was scheduled to begin in Singapore on Thursday to discuss bids by two Indian companies to acquire a stake in the troubled $2.9 billion Dabhol Power Co.
The lenders - Industrial Bank of India, Industrial Finance Corporation of India, State Bank of India and ICICI - approached the Bombay court to demand that work on the power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra resume to ensure adequate cash flows to the project and help its promoters pay dues to the four financial institutions. 
Dabhol Power Co., the state utility Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the Government of India and the Maharashtra government were the four parties named in the lawsuit. 
Indian banks and financial institutions, which have invested more than $1.3 billion in the project, want Dabhol to continue work on the project and the MSEB to buy the power produced. 
The two-day meeting in Singapore was scheduled to discuss the bids made by the two Indian companies, Tatas and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply, to acquire a stake in DPC. Enron had offered to sell the stake in DPC for $850 million, at a 30 percent discount, while Tatas wanted a 50 percent discount. 
On Monday, Enron began its pullout from the Dabhol power project by issuing a notice that it will sell its stake in the project to its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. 
The asset transfer notice issued by the Dabhol Power Project to the MSEB comes after a prolonged payment dispute with the electricity board. 
The dispute forced the Houston-based company to shut down the Dabhol plant in May. 
Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co. and Bechtel Group Inc. of the United States each hold 10 percent stakes each in the company. 
Enron has moved a London court for international arbitration, but says it would prefer a negotiated settlement with the federal government and the Maharashtra state government. 
The company still prefers a negotiated purchase of the project by the Indian government and Indian term lending bodies that have funded the equity of foreign sponsors.

USA: El Paso says it does not expect Enron bankruptcy.

11/07/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Energy company El Paso Corp. said on Wednesday it does not expect beleaguered competitor Enron Corp. to file for bankruptcy. 
Ralph Eads, who heads El Paso's merchant energy business, which includes electricity and natural gas marketing and trading, told analysts at a meeting in Houston that the prospect of an Enron bankruptcy was ""remote"".
El Paso has gained some market share from Enron in recent weeks as a result of some companies' reluctance to do business with Enron, Eads said, but he added that El Paso has not scaled back its own business dealings with Enron. 
Eads said El Paso does not expect Enron's problems to result in a ""domino effect"" that could lead to reduced liquidity in U.S. electricity and natural gas markets, a scenario that has been troubling some analysts and investors recently. 
El Paso Chief Executive Bill Wise told the meeting, which was broadcast over the Internet, that El Paso might be interested in acquiring some energy assets from Enron but was not interested in acquiring an equity stake in the rival company, which is reported to be seeking an injection of new capital.

Energy traders are icing out Enron
Shares trade at 9-year lows for 2nd straight day 
By Lisa Sanders, 
CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:47 PM ET Nov. 7, 2001 
 
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Amid mounting questions about Enron's liquidity and creditworthiness, players in the energy-trading business have already begun to limit their exposure to the embattled power merchant.

The revelations came Wednesday as Enron's stock (ENE: news, chart, profile) plunged 24 percent following news that Standard & Poor's cut its ratings for the company's credit-linked notes to two notches above junk status.

""Everybody's trying to balance out their exposure to Enron as best they can,"" said an energy trader who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""That means not doing business or minimizing their business with Enron.""

1 of 4 energy trades

Traders' attempts to isolate the company underscore concerns about the stability of the overall energy-trading market, in which Enron is involved in 1 out of every 4 trades. 

However, some industry watchers are confident that the energy market can survive if Houston-based Enron were to disappear.

""Even though they quote-unquote make the market, the market exists whether Enron is there or not,"" said Phil Flynn, senior markets analyst at Alaron.com. ""Those that think this is the end of energy trading have another thing coming.""

Enron, its shares trading at levels not seen since 1992, saw the stock fall $2.27 to $7.40 on in afternoon volume of 58 million.

On Wednesday, Standard & Poor's, which just last week downgraded Enron's corporate credit rating, cut the rating on the credit-linked notes of Enron Credit Linked Notes Trusts to BBB from BBB-plus. S&P also added a ""Watch negative"" designation, meaning the rating agency is poised to issue further downgrades if warranted. 

""The CreditWatch placements recognize the uncertainties that surround the company and its credit quality in the short run due to the possibility of further anticipated developments in the capital markets,"" the rating agency wrote.

Wednesday's downgrade affects $500 million worth of notes, which are derivatives linked to Enron's senior unsecured debt, now rated BBB.

""The investors are taking the risk of Enron credit"" by purchasing the securities from the trusts even though these are not issued by Enron,"" said Tom Fritz, a Standard & Poor's managing director.

In addition, Standard & Poor's cut to BBB Yosemite Securities Co. Series 2000-A. The obligations use Enron's corporate rating as a backstop. 

The counterparty to Yosemite and the credit-linked notes is Citibank, Fritz said. Last week, J.P. Morgan joined with Salomon Smith Barney, which along with Citibank is a unit of Citigroup (C: news, chart, profile), to extend $1 billion in new credit to Enron to help the company's liquidity.

'Not business as usual'

""With these downgrades, it's not business as usual,"" the energy trader said. ""We're already in the process of losing a counterparty that contributed a good deal of liquidity to the energy-trading market.""

The trader cited Calpine (CPN: news, chart, profile), Dynegy (DYN: news, chart, profile), and El Paso Energy (EPG: news, chart, profile) as energy traders that have a chance to gain market share, but he conceded that Enron won't be replaced overnight, should it cease to exist.

""Energy trading won't be destroyed at all,"" the trader said. ""It will certainly be diminished but not gone.""

What Enron's absence would do is make it more difficult for lesser creditworthy companies to participate in the market. Exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange may gain a higher profile. 

Both of them are trying to establish a clearinghouse for the unregulated market for derivative-energy transactions, as the NYMEX already does with futures. 

In other news, Enron is preparing to close most of its Asian broadband telecommunications business, part of a global restructuring that comes as the company is seeking a capital infusion of as much as $2 billion to help it through a financial crisis. See previous story.

""Poor demand for broadband is being exacerbated by falling prices, requiring Enron to consider the best options for managing its global broadband business,"" according to a recent company memo obtained by CBS.MarketWatch.com.

Legal Group Plans Suit to Void California Power Contracts

Legal Group Plans Suit to Void California Power Contracts

     Escondido, California, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- A conservative
legal foundation said it will file a lawsuit tomorrow to void long-
term contracts California signed with power generators, claiming
they put an unfair burden on taxpayers.

     The United States Justice Foundation intends to sue in
Sacramento County Superior Court, said Richard D. Ackerman, lead
counsel on the case for the group. The USJF wants a court to
terminate the long-term power contracts and require money already
paid to the generators to be returned to the state.

     The USJF proposes a class action to represent California
taxpayers and alleges violations of the state's business and open-
meeting laws. Ackerman said his group may need to forge new law to
succeed in the case.

     ``You're gonna have some serious legal battles that may go to
the appeals level in this case,'' Ackerman said.

     California officials last spring signed about $43 billion in
long-term power contracts after two investor-owned utilities
became insolvent. Governor Gray Davis has said the contracts were
needed to bring stability to California's energy market. Since
then, the cost of power has dropped, leaving California with
contracts to buy electricity above spot-market prices.

     Enron Corp., Southern California Edison Company, Pacific Gas
& Electric Company, Green Mountain Energy, San Diego Gas &
Electric Company, Reliant Energy Company, PacifiCorp Power
Marketing, Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, and Calpine Energy Company
have electricity contracts with the state, according to a USJF
press release.

     The USJF said it sent a letter to California officials giving
them notice of its intent to sue. The group, which calls itself
``Your conservative voice in the courts'' on its Web site, is
supported by individual donations, Ackerman said.

As you may know, the only person more arrogant than an investment banker is
someone in private equity.  Investment bankers pride themselves on making
vast amounts of money, but a successful private equity professional takes
devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while
making even more money than his (rarely her) investment banking brethren.
Unfortunately, some members of the private equity community mistakenly
believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and
charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of
capital, as Karl Marx so astutely described.

Consider the plight of Peter Chung (see attached email), a recent hire at
the Carlyle Group.  After completing his two-year stint as an Analyst at
Merrill Lynch, Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea
working as part of Carlyle's vast Asian investment team.  Working at a
private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs (which
would be legally classified as brothels in the United States) 3-4 times a
week, though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to ""learn a
little bit of the buyside business"" so he can begin nightly visits.  Already
a self-described ""stud"" on the New York City dating scene, Chung looked to
the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign
men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents (roughly
$12,600 per person).  By making in excess of ten times the average national
wage, Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals
were attracted to his fat wallet and U.S. citizenship.  Thus bolstered by an
initial rendezvous or two, Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out
on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea.

As of May 15, 2001, Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five
""hot chicks.""  According to Chung's own calculations, there are roughly one
billion ""hot chicks"" remaining in Korea.  Clearly there is a break in
Chung's sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the
global female population of 3 billion comprised of 1/3 hot Korean chicks,
but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls
off or he dies of exhaustion.  Sadly, Chung cannot complete his mission
alone.  The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to U.S.
standards (Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small) and he
needs your help to continue his quest for infamy.  If you would like to
contribute to this valiant mission, please direct your gift of a
FDA-approved ""domes"" to the address below:

Peter Chung
The Carlyle Group
Suite 1009, CCMM Bldg.
12, Yoido-dong, Youngdeungpo-ku
Seoul 150-010, Korea

Chung asks that you consider using FedEx or another international overnight
courier since he may be on the verge of running out of protection.
Alternatively, if you would like to pursue a job working for The Carlyle
Group in Korea, write to the following address:

The Honorable James A. Baker
1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Suite 220 South
Washington, DC 20004-2505

Please note that Mr. Baker, the lead spokesperson for The Carlyle Group, a
the former Secretary of State from the George Herbert Walker Bush
Administration.  Since leaving the White House, Jim Baker has continued his
international mission to spread goodwill and STDs throughout the world by
supporting young Romeos such as Mr. Chung.

For a first-hand account of life in private equity, please read Peter
Chung's travelogue (attached).  Please keep in mind that Chung's experience
is partially a function of his prior status as a ""stud"" and may not be
reflective of private equity experiences in general.  Not all of us can hope
to be as smart, debonair and modest as Mr. Chung.

Regards,

Justin

So I've been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say,
LIFE IS GOOD....

I've got a spanking brand new 2000 sq. foot 3 bedroom apt. with a 200 sq.
foot terrace running the entire length of my apartment with a view
overlooking Korea's main river and nightline......Why do I need 3 bedrooms?
Good question,.... the main bedroom is for my queen size bed,...where CHUNG
is going to fuck every hot chick in Korea over the next 2 years (5 down,
1,000,000,000 left to go).... the second bedroom is for my harem of
chickies, and the third bedroom is for all of you fuckers when you come out
to visit my ass in Korea.  I go out to Korea's finest clubs, bars and
lounges pretty much every other night on the weekdays and everyday on the
weekends to (I think in about 2 months, after I learn a little bit of the
buyside business I'll probably go out every night on the weekdays).  I know
I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about, on average, 5-8 phone
numbers a night and at least 3 hot chicks that say that they want to go
home with me every night I go out.  I love the buyside,.... I have bankers
calling me everyday with opportunties and they pretty much cater to my
every whim - you know (golfing events, lavish dinners, a night out
clubbing). The guys I work with are also all chilll - I live in the same
apt building as my VP and he drives me around in his Porsche (1 of 3 in all
of Korea) to work and when we go out.  What can I say,.... live is good,...
CHUNG is KING of his domain here in Seoul.....

So,.... all of you fuckers better keep in touch and start making plans to
come out and visit my ass ASAP, I'll show you guys an unbelievable
time....My contact info is below....
Oh, by the way,... someone's gotta start fedexing me boxes of domes,...I
brought out about 40 but I think I'll run out of them by Saturday.....

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

BPA and Kaiser Reach Agreement on Power (IB)
Kaiser Aluminum and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) reached an agreement on a five-year power delivery deal that has been the source of conflict between the two parties for almost a year. Kaiser Aluminum closed its smelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000, choosing to resell contracted power from the BPA on the spot market. According to the Spokesman Review, ""Kaiser netted more than $460 million from the sales."" Other aluminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring 2001 with Bonneville. Under these agreements, the companies agreed to keep smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region, and BPA agreed, in return, to give the smelters, when they restarted operations, a $20 per megawatt-hour (MWh) credit for obtaining power from sources other than BPA. Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA that negates a ""take-or-pay"" clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the federal power whether used or not. BPA said, ""Under the agreement signed today, Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take all the power under the contract...And if [BPA] can't resell it, we are not going to hold [Kaiser] liable for the difference,"" Clearing Up reported. As a concession for the elimination of the ""take-or-pay"" clause, Kaiser will receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load. Kaiser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was using the money it had gained reselling power ""to pay down long-term debt, rebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuses,"" rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off, the BPA, and building generation, AP reported.

United States-Energy: 
CA Power Authority Names CEO (IB)
The California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority named Laura Doll its new chief executive officer on 5 October. Texan Doll ""had previously worked for several communications and consulting firms,"" and will be receiving a salary of $200,000 as the power authority's CEO, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. S. David Freeman, the authority's chair, will retain his post. Freeman said he will ""handle fewer administrative duties,"" and will ""be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups such as the Legislature and consumer groups,"" The Chronicle reported. According to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register, consumer groups, businesses, and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the power authority, which has vowed to secure nearly 3,000 megawatts (MW) of power by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages. The power authority, which was created by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001, can issue up to $5 billion in bonds to bolster the state's power supply through financing new renewable generation or peaker projects. The Register said that businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates could be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1,000 MW of green power and 2,000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002. The state's Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority's planned purchases, according to the committee chair, Assembly member Fred Keeley. Keeley said ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law,"" the Register reported.

United States-Energy: 
FERC Refunds Ordered (IB)
On 5 October, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordered four power marketers to provide refunds for July sales that exceeded a federally mandated price limit. Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos., and Reliant Energy were the companies specifically mentioned. Under a 19 June FERC order, price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the volatile electricity spot market. The June order stated that companies charging in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the month in question to file justifications for their overcharges. The 5 October order said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications, but all were rejected, and that other companies that overcharged during July, but did not file justifications, would also be subject to ordered refunds. Although FERC did not release specific figures, the California Independent System Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to $260,000, The Los Angeles Times reported. The commission's order explained the rejection of cost justifications for the four companies. The explanations by Mirant and Dynegy, filed more than seven days after July ended, were ""untimely and...neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transactions,"" according to the document. Reliant's filing was ""not consistent with the requirements of the June 19 Order,"" and Willams ""did not provide any cost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the commission's pricing methodology,"" the commissioners wrote. A Mirant spokesman told Reuters that ""his company was ordered to refund $33,800,"" while a Williams spokesman told the LA Times ""$30,000 worth of electricity sales are subject to the FERC rebate for both June and July.""

Thanks for understanding my special little e-mail pal. That's cute. Yeah,
it's funny when I re-read the e-mail about the not being funny as me
comment. I feel like such a loser for being mean especially with all the
things going on right now. I actually have one really good friend that I
broke down and told about our little ""internet encounter"" and I was telling
her about the ""not as funny as me"" comment and she was cracking up saying
that I have told her that many times in not so many words. My life is a
Seinfeld episode. She reminded me of an incident when energy guy met some of
my friends from work and every time he started to control the conversation,
I would talk over him because I was embarrassed of what he might say. I'm
seriously going to he@@. How mean am I? Anyway, we share the same viewpoint
on relationships. I KNOW I get pickier as I get older. Not only do you know
more about what you want, you know a hell of a lot more about what you don't
want and what you are and are not able to tolerate. I'm so different than I
was at 20. It's hilarious how much you put up with when your really young.
Relationships should be easy. ESPECIALLY in the first year. That's why I
know I need to do something about my situation soon. We have way too many
issues for 3 and a half months. Are you kidding me?!

Family. One brother (26) and goes to U of H. Not graduate school. He's still
working on a bachelor degree. He's a whole conversation in itself. I love
him to death but he still has so much growing up to do. He acts like he's 16
instead of 26. Mom and Dad still live down in Lake Jackson. Dad's remarried
and Mom just got her second divorce. Ask me why I'm scared of being in bad
relationships? Ha. The grandparents of whom I'm incredible close to live in
LJ as well. I usually make it down there every other Sunday as there health
is fading and it breaks my heart. They are touch old birds though. Cute as
hell and have been married 65 years. I know!! Amazing.

Well, let's see. Oh, no way you are funnier than me. :) We'll see. I will
write your cell down. I'm kind of panicking because I cant find my cell
phone this morning. Not good considering I have every number imaginable
programed in there. Not too smart. I think I may have left it at the nail
shop yesterday. I call it. It rings but not in my place or car. Not good.

Hey, have a good day and I'll talk with you soon. I'll send you some more
pictures. Some are pretty old. I had really short hair last year but I was
still cute. Kidding. A little.

Later,
