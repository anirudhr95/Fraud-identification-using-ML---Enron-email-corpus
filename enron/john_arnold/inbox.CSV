Regarding: energy trading positions 
 
To Kevin Presto, Harry Arora, and John Arnold:
 
I am writing to you to express my desire to be apart of the Wholesale Power and Gas Trading operation that will potentially be created with an entity that has a high credit rating.  I have been working for Rogers Herndon in Enron Wholesale Services on the Options Desk.  In this role I have modeled the power options that are embedded in the various deals done through Enron Energy Services with large industrial and commercial clients.  In addition, I profitably managed the positions and priced deals for structurers and originators.  I realize that now is a difficult time but am confident that I would make an excellent addition to your team for several key reasons:
 
?         Proven experience in the financial markets and direct trading experience in various markets, including electricity and natural gas, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign exchange, EuroCurrency and EuroDollar deposits
?         Team player and high work ethic, successfully balancing trading opportunities with managing risk
?         Solid portfolio management and risk management experience in electricity and mortgage banking 
?         Five years direct experience in trading, risk management, structured products and marketing of electricity for the United States
?         Actively involved in the physical markets and strong understanding of the western grid
?         Experience trading OTC forwards and options at major hubs in other NERC regions such as Cinergy, Entergy, ERCOT, NEPOOL and PJM
?         Worked for both unregulated power marketers and regulated utility
?         Extensive experience in derivatives and structured products
?         Ability to effectively work with marketers pricing and structuring deals for industrial and commercial end users of energy
?         Strength in mentoring junior traders
 
Thank you,

Subject:	Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

"Fimat/Soc Gen","John - you may have already heard this but on Friday, NYMEX increased margins for clearing brokers posting for Enron by 50%.  Also Soc Gen cancelled their margin line on Friday (Warren wants to make it very clear that it was Soc Gen and not Fimat.)  So far, Fimat is not reducing its trading limit with us but is passing through the NYMEX requirement.  All of our brokers will have the right to do this and I expect them to do so.  Sarah

Also, are you looking at the position for your own purposes or is someone asking about them?

"EOL Code Update","John,

I am performing code updates to the stand-alone EOL workstation WNAEOL-48101 this evening and wanted to check with you to see at which point it would be convenient for you.  I assume after the business day would be acceptable and my intent is to start near 6:00 p.m. or, at any time you decide is convenient for you.
I called a short while ago and will do so again before proceeding, but if you receive this email and need to contact me, you may reach me at extension 5-7004.  Thanks.

John,

I am performing code updates to the stand-alone EOL workstation WNAEOL-48101 this evening and wanted to check with you to see at which point it would be convenient for you.  I assume after the business day would be acceptable and my intent is to start near 6:00 p.m. or, at any time you decide is convenient for you.
I called a short while ago and will do so again before proceeding, but if you receive this email and need to contact me, you may reach me at extension 5-7004.  Thanks.

"Small world!","Hey John!

How are you??  I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've
thought of you a lot recently.  I hope things are going well, despite the
uncertainty.

I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny
story.  Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled
instead?  John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known
since childhood and is a mentor of sorts.  When he got off the phone, Chuck
told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar.
I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.  So
I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to
ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.  Poor thing says ""yeah,
that was me, but not one of my finer moments...""  I could tell he was
embarrassed.  I guess there are some things in life you just never live
down.

I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.  We shared a
cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the
same time.  I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how
young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and
is now doing really well.  They immediately said ""John Arnold!""  Shocked the
hell out of me, honestly.  They were very funny in saying that I had made a
""bad trade"" by marrying my husband instead of you.  I told them I would keep
that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember
off the top of my head.  They both work for a weather trading firm in the
Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons.

Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today.
I really do hope you're doing well.  Please drop me a line when you aren't
trading up a storm...

Warm regards,
Heather

WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Federal futures regulators on Monday accused two former Coastal Corp. <CGP.N> vice presidents with fraud in an illegal trading scheme in 1996.
A complaint filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused Clay Krhovjakand Paul Cochran with defrauding Coastal, which merged with El Paso Corp. <EPG.N> earlier this year.
Over a five-month period in 1996, the two allegedly shifted $89,228 from profitable Coastal trades to accounts controlled by other, unnamed participants,the CFTC said in a complaint filed as an internal administrative complaint.
The scheme ""ensured Cochran, Krhovjakand other participants risk-free personal profits,"" the CFTC said.

"RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)","
The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
			          I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""	
		               She replies:	""No."" 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

"Broker Quotes - PLEASE READ","John and Dutch -

This email is sent to discuss what is needed with respect to NYMEX quotes from the broker market.  Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.  It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:

1.  Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)

2.  Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)


In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.  I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.  We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.  We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.

Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.  However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.  Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.  Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.  

Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.

If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the ""war room"" next to Louise's office.  If I'm not there, please call me at (713) 927-3003 or at ext 53923.


Thanks,

Jay

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity --- Firm Will Pay Debt, Keep Cash Cushion
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R. Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith and Jathon Sapsford

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity. 
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But, ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor's, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down six cents at $16.35. 
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes more than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999. 
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by underperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, particularly in today's slower economy. 
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealings with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents related to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclosed its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee-related entity known as Chewco. 
Chewco was established in 1997 ""with approximately $400 million in capital commitments"" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the partnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a managing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the document. 
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco. 
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In response to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that ""Michael Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron."" Mr. Fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partnerships in July. 
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regarding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves ""any director or executive officer."" By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumably wouldn't have. 
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a ""material"" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents in charge of major business units and ""other persons who perform similar policy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of management.""

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year. 
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 million through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paired with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. 
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. Lay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, he sold shares for a total of $26 million. 
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales ""a personal decision."" Many sales by Enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises. 
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research director of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on investment ideas. 
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares. 
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment. 
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they sold 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3.4 million shares for $123.1 million. 
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company shares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the company and Mr. Fastow. 
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics says. 
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment. 
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The suit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 million of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Credit-Rating Concerns
By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse. 
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% drop during the past two weeks. 
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resulting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower. 
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yesterday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in bonds, a small percentage of a typical trade. 
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating concerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer. 
""Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest,"" said Harold Rivkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N.J. 
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a ""default swap"" -- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit being insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lucent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology company's troubles earlier during the year. 
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment-grade level. 
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last week. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of putting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its long-term ratings outlook to ""negative,"" citing concerns about the company's financial flexibility.) 
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst. ""These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels,"" said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an independent fixed-income research firm in New York. ""They aren't distressed yet, but they are headed in that direction."" 
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the company's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments. 
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacity and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets. 
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without that credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derived from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or commodity. 
""Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses,"" said Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. ""Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron's counterparties"" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with Enron -- ""is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credit analysts said. ""I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
""So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them,"" said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's utility energy project finance group. ""No one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have publicly stated that it's business as usual."" 
Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Treasurys 
Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week's flood of Treasury, corporate and agency debt issues. 
At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4.588% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. 
The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield 5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday. 
Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6. Also providing support for longer maturities, the Treasury Department made another repurchase of issues outstanding. It received offers for $5.04 billion in callable 30-year bonds, of which it accepted $1 billion. The offer-to-cover ratio, an indication of demand, was 5.04.

Corporate Bonds 
Motorola Inc.'s offering of three-year mandatory convertible securities, expected late yesterday was boosted from a planned $875 million and could total as much as $1.15 billion (proceeds) if investors exercise their overallotment option. 
The securities were expected to have a dividend of between 6.75% and 7% and a conversion premium of 20% to 22%. Earlier indications were a dividend of 7% to 7.5% and a conversion premium of 18% to 22%. The deal was to come through Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney. 
Separately, LSI Logic Corp. repriced an offering of $450 million of five-year convertible subordinated notes, lowering the price to 99 from par, people familiar with the Rule 144a private placement said. 
The notes have a 4% coupon and a 41% conversion premium and now offer a yield-to-maturity of 4.22%. They were quoted lower at 98 1/2 early yesterday, a sign that the deal wasn't well-received after being brought overnight by Lehman Brothers.

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about. 
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critics would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't figure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company. The company's ""lack of disclosure and transparency,"" he says, is ""a longstanding Enron hallmark."" 
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its ""U.S. Select List,"" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's larger but prestigious ""Recommended List"" of 200 or so favored stocks, where it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993. 
""Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze it' or `I can't figure it out,' "" says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclosed number of Enron shares. ""If that were the case, there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn't follow."" 
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week. 
""Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box,"" says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall -- throughout this year. ""It was really a trust-me story, when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust."" 
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had. 
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practices are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable? 
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company's various partnership transactions. 
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings. 
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darling, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the stock, 10 had a ""strong buy"" or equivalent rating on the stock, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a ""buy,"" though not strongly. 
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a ""sell"" rating on Enron. 
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile examples of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warranted. 
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general collapse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- particularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the companies they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees and other revenue. 
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, for one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Boston, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. 
""Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that hasn't been involved,"" says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer, who still rates the stock a ""strong buy"" with a $40 price target. ""They pay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."" 
He adds, ""We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Are we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to provide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation on the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed."" 
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron, calls his holding ""a meaningful investment"" that is ""not small."" But he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer says his clients ""are happy to know"" he has a stake in Enron, because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is. 
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosures of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, he wrote that he and many other investors historically ""have given Enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings"" and position as an industry leader. 
""There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make their money, but every quarter they do,"" he says. ""It's hard to get inside to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."" 
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains ""confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] and an ultimate recovery in the share price."" 
""I know I'm wrong on the stock,"" Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stock doesn't have much further to fall. 
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. ""Even in relative terms, analysts remain very bullish on this stock,"" says Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock on Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a ""buy"" rating. Enron scores a 1.6. ""This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out,"" Mr. Hill says. 
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped it to ""sell"" from ""buy,"" with a brief stop at ""hold."" While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her recent downgrades come ""too little, too late."" 
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the company's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said ""no,"" she says. 
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC ""inquiry,"" she asked Enron about the previous denial. ""They told me it is an inquiry, not an investigation,"" she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Action by Enron halts stock's fall 
But credit ratings are being reviewed 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The recent freefall of Enron Corp.'s stock price stabilized Thursday, a day after the world's largest energy trader replaced its chief financial officer. 
Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, also made two announcements Thursday night aimed at reassuring the financial community. 
In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOnline on Thursday was above average levels. 
Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokeswoman said. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" Jeff McMahon, who took over Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement. 
Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on Thursday. 
Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: ""Enron continues to be the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our customers continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are strong and performing well."" 
Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as ""just more negative sentiment."" 
At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. 
Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enron, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a possible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative. 
Moody's Investors Service put all of Enron's long-term debt on review for potential downgrade last week. 
Enron, which noted that losing its investment-grade rating would take downgrades of three notches, said Thursday it will do everything in its power to defend its current rating. 
In the SEC inquiry, federal securities regulators are reviewing transactions between Enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, who was removed as Enron's chief financial officer Wednesday. Enron removed Fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility. 
Wall Street is also questioning certain of Enron's financing vehicles and is wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the months ahead. 
S&P said it was concerned that the sizable drop in Enron's market capitalization has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the company's plans to rebuild its balance sheet. 
But it also noted that the ""fundamental strength"" of Enron's energy marketing and trading business has remained steady. 
Unless Enron's rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners, Fitch said, it could ""impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets,"" which would hurt its ability to conduct business. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, said the actions by S&P and Fitch might make some of Enron's energy customers skittish.

DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 18bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. 
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three years, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amendment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour corporate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt ""new deal"", prefer to see increased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects. 
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying little or no tax. 
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be made retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded. 
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calculate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone, while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Dollars 671m. 
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's third largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced to sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m. 
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dislike other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capital investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They say these amount to a ""giant corporate giveaway"". 
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would help companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely to start in the new year. 
""Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of working families,"" the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of California, said. 
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Dollars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of states. 
* A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world economy after the terrorist attacks on the US, trade secretary Patricia Hewitt said yesterday, writes Charlotte Denny 
As a new report predicted that global trade growth will collapse this year, Ms Hewitt warned that the world must not retreat into protectionism or isolationism in the wake of the attacks. WTO trade ministers are gathering in Doha, Qatar, in two weeks' time to discuss launching a new round of talks, the first since the collapse of their meeting in Seattle, nearly two years ago.

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy? 
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor. 
From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing way.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff member, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer. 
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is going to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.'' 
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client to restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements.'' 
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which would certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting. 
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence. 
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess at Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. It will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accounting was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explain -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer. 
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

Enron draws down at least 1 bln usd from credit lines to boost mkt confidence

10/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of 1 bln usd as part of moves to restore market confidence in the company. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" said newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon.
""This is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in Enron. Additionally, we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long-term credit rating."" 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Enron drew down about 3 bln usd and will use part of the money to offer to redeem about 1.85 bln usd of outstanding commercial paper, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. The newspaper cited a person familiar with the matter. 
It quoted observers as saying the move may be is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. 
The source also said Enron is talking to its banks about a new, multi-billion-dollar credit line.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse. 
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief James Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company ""will perish"" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have worsened since the terrorist attacks. ""Today, we are literally hemorrhaging money,"" he wrote. 
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL (UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,000 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expected to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings. 
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeling that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulties to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one union have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked. 
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but sometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise. 
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War 
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our annihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy some DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car? 
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that Congress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism efforts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the economy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. ""The economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists,"" says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. ""War bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."" 
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just superfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savings bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by the federal government. 
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bonds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books. 
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the company on what's delicately termed a ""leave of absence."" 
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence. 
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disinclination to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure ""unsettling,"" noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase, Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And there could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions. 
4. Gold Diggers 
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. According to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty precious-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, with net inflows of $101 million. 
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, during the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion. But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long. 
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an embarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same period, they were up 7.13%. 
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Sept. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again. 
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma operating profit. 
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in long-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningless aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn an economic profit. 
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren Jenson added the humble qualifier, ""There are no guarantees."" Amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago. 
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made progress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20% over the past year. 
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget and SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from previous buy ratings. ""We thought there might be upside to our estimates,"" noted Blodget. ""There wasn't.""

Stocks Post Gains After A Rough Morning

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pair of grim economic reports. 
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in third-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversing an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29, to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99. 
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in recent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good news regarding individual companies. 
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raised its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarded the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several other parts of the energy sector along with it. 
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69. 
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 44 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-storage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54. 
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measure also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a $100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrorist attacks on the economy. 
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily on the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American International Group and WorldCom. 
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 percent dip many analysts had forecast. 
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, the second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally associated with recessions. 
Other Indicators 
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the American Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2,000 small stocks rose 8.31, to 435.96. 
* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and volume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion. 
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday. 
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York trading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents. 
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
* Gold for current delivery rose to $277.80 a troy ounce, from $275.90 on Wednesday, on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Commodity Exchange.

Sudhakar will head Enron probe panel

MUMBAI: Retired supreme court judge Sudhakar Kurdukar will head the judicial panel set up by the Maharashtra government to investigate into the controversial Enron deal. 
An announcement in this regard was made by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh at a press conference held at Mantralaya on Wednesday.
The ruling Democratic Front (DF) coalition had differences over the appointment of the judge, with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) demanding that a retired judge of the Bombay high court head the judicial panel. The Congress and the Left Front partners in the DF, however, insisted on a supreme court judge. 
The issue was hotly debated in the coordination committee of the DF. The NCP members in the DF finally left the decision to Mr Deshmukh.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 billion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the moves were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down six cents at $16.35.

Enron chief executive resigns from board of i2 Technologies

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

DALLAS (AP) - Kenneth Lay, the chairman and chief executive of embattled Enron Corp., has resigned from the board of software company i2 Technologies. 
""This is a very painful decision,"" Lay said in a statement issued Thursday by Dallas-based i2 Technologies. ""But now that I am again taking on the CEO responsibilities at Enron, I must reduce my outside activities.""
Lay resumed the chief executive's job at Enron in August after Jeff Skilling surprised investors by leaving the Houston-based energy company. 
Enron officials did not immediately return calls from The Associated Press. 
In the past week, Enron has been rocked by questions surrounding partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by the company's chief financial officer. The official was replaced on Tuesday. 
Enron's stock price has fallen nearly 50 percent since interest in the partnerships intensified, and the company acknowledged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the arrangements 
I2 makes software to help companies manage their supply chains, and its clients include Texas Instruments, Ford Motor Co. and Dell Computer Corp. 
I2 stock plunged nearly 25 percent on Oct. 17 after the company reported a $5.53 billion third-quarter loss and said it would cut 1,000 jobs, about one-fifth of the work force. 
Lay joined the board in October 2000. No replacement was announced. 
In trading Thursday, i2 shares rose 24 cents to $4.95, and Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35.

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its problems are isolated
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector. 
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, executives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and free-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector. They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
""The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday, a week ago or a month ago,"" said Jim Donnell, president of Duke Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and trades power. 
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy Inc., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday, when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals. 
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 percent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon. 
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earnings, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse. 
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnerships managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence. 
""They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn't come through with flying colors,"" said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York. 
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits. 
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices. 
""Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear,"" Ellinghaus said. 
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment. 
""The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is overdone,"" Barone said. 
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income of $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million in profits. 
""It's business as usual,"" said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. 
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earned $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sept. 30. 
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesday because of ""dire"" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy. 
""All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality,"" Ellinghaus said. 
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday. 
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying close attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid. 
""They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit,"" he said. ""They've never missed a deadline.""

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

Enron Broadband Begins Closing London, Singapore Offices
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will close down its trading offices in London and Singapore over the next six months. 
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asian and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headquarters.
""It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out there in the market now,"" Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie James said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires. 
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Singapore office has 15 or fewer employees. 
Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizens. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employees. 
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices. 
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that international bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market. 
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to bandwidth trading, making the markets in those regions ripe for growth.

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to trading partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conference call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California about renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the company signed with the state earlier this year. 
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's consistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conference call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, like Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure to Enron. 
""We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net exposure to Enron,"" said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management, Paul Pasoli. ""We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit threshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."" 
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be halted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a little money. 
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the state of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now than when California bought this past winter and spring. 
""Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif contracts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties to do so as well,"" said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. ""If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."" 
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its program to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is about three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capacity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the difference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said that difference, or ""spark spread,"" has grown the past few months. Furthermore, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all projects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment. 
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually through 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and won't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corporation

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, against defendants Enron Corporation (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). 
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume that the class member(s) with the ""largest financial interest"" in the outcome of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discretion in determining which class member(s) have the ""largest financial interest,"" and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both absolute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please contact Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. at classaction@srk-law.com for a more thorough explanation of the Lead Plaintiff selection process. If you have relatively small losses, your ability to participate in any recovery will be protected by the Lead Plaintiff(s), and you need take no affirmative steps at this time. 
If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel Robert M. Roseman toll-free at 888-844-5862 or via E-mail at classaction@srk-law.com. For more detailed information about the firm please visit its website at http://www.spectorandroseman.com.

TGS Q3 net profit up 22 pct yr-on-yr on higher NGL sales, transport revenues

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Perez Companc SA and Enron Corp pipeline joint venture, Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA, said its net profit in the three months to September rose 22 pct year-on-year to 37 mln pesos on the back of strong growth in sales of natural gas liquids (NGL) and increased revenue from transport. 
Total revenue grew 24 pct year-on-year to 147 mln pesos, as ""TGS continues to grow its revenues in all of its business segments,"" CEO Eduardo Ojea Quintana said.
NGL sales surged 86 pct year-on-year to 31.1 mln pesos, after a partial takeover of the Cerri complex's production at Bahia Blanca, although volumes declined as a result of the start-up of the Mega project at the beginning of 2001, Ojea Quintana said. 
Gas transport revenue rose 11 pct year-on-year to 109.6 mln pesos as average gas transportation contracted capacity rose 6 pct to 62.5 mln cubic metres daily, following a capacity expansion completed in June. 
However, he also noted ""important challenges, mostly associated with the relevant regulatory issues that remain unresolved, as well as the deep economic crisis that Argentina is currently undergoing."" 
""These negative factors have adversely affected our investment plans for the current year and for 2002,"" Ojea Quintana added.

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion. 
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has ""more than adequate"" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain its long-term credit rating. 
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook for Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair plans to rebuild the balance sheet. 
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative news from the company. 
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Average daily volume is 7,832,606 shares. 
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediately. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe Enron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock. 
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks, much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of the $1.01 billion charges. 
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said. 
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this week. 
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have concerns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in policy concerning the company. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they haven't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets. 
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

"RE:","I completely understand and thanks for letting me know.  Maybe when I become a famous rock star and leave Enron you will reconsider.  I don't know if I can make it on Friday.  I am singing in a good friends wedding this weekend and the rehearsal dinner is Friday night.  If you are going to be out any other time this week let me know and if not I can get it next week.  How was your weekend with your friend?  
 
Talk to you soon.

Ok, so I'm an asshole.  Sorry for not responding earlier.  There really were some things I needed to think about. 
As I spend the majority of my life at or around Enron, the majority of the people I know professionally, socially, and romantically have been from Enron.  The further I get professionally, the harder it seems to continue the other two: socially to keep my sanity, and romantically for so many other reasons.  Although I do really like you and am very attracted to you, it is just really tough for me to ask you out right now.  Your only fault in my eyes is your place of employment.  As such, I would prefer to try to be friends for a while.  
I still do have your necklace.  I'll promise to have it Friday at the front porch if you're there.

Subject: Hello!



It's Friday, and I'm here settling Nymex.  I got a phone call from Evelyn Wednesday before Thanksgiving to come in today.  It's o.k.  I don't mind.  I get Monday off.  Just a few notes to let you know what's going on.  EDF Mann, Paribas and Carr Futures London pulled a fast one.  They set the margin at 150% more of what it would have been.  Here are the numbers incoming and outgoing.

        OUTGOING                

                Smith Barney Financial                  $232,499.00 
                Paribas                                 $46,026,588.00 
                EDF Mann                                $760,515.00 
                Carr Futures                            $12,331,010.66

                Saul Stone                              $19,800.00 
                HSBC                                    $291,325.00 
                HSBC Canada                             No Margin Call 
                R. J. Obrien                            $12,320.00 
                J.P. Morgan                             $292,827.00 
                Credit Suisse                           $200,261.00 
                

Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday, so we did not settle.  

FIMAT was not in, and the numbers came out like this.  They were supposed to have paid down on the loan by $2,931,087.24.  I don't know how you handle this.  Hopefully they will do this on Monday.

I know this is a terrible welcome back, but it was something that had to be done.

"Willow Lane","Tracy called me at work.  A water pipe broke under the street between her house and the old Hamilton house.  She said water was shooting everywhere and that they were to turn off the water for at least 5 hours.  Well, they worked fast because when I got home at 6:00, I had water.  So I made some turkey soup.  But Willow Lane will be torn up for a while as it just buckled the cement.  The hole was about 7 feet down according to Tracy.  Good thing this didn't happen on Thanksgiving!  I have a foundation man coming out next week to check the foundation.  Tracy seems to have a similar problem.  Maybe we can get a two for one deal.    John, I need your book list at Amazon.com this week.  No excuses!  Oh, tell Jeannie that I finished her soup this evening for dinner.  She's a good cook!  Have a good week guys.  Love, Mom

Subject:	ENA Q4 Settlement

Dutch,

I am working on pulling together due diligence information for Global Finance in regards to ENA trading activity.  One number that stood out to us on the ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500MM.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting group, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for further insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about that settlement?

Thanks,
Ben

"RE: wheres the love?","hey man no problem.i know youre a busy man.its getting ahrder to say how to
play this thing. sprds are massive contango-minimal inverses in the winter.
indeed there shudnt be any problems to supply gas this winter but suply
growth hasnt been stellar and prob wont rise from here now.im not a raging
bull but the past couple of aga and the cashs trength. and the mkt
structure(no sellers in the forward), leads me to beleive there cud be more
upside. mkt is prob a range mkt for a time. but overall i think this is a
weather bet. if we have a winter it will suport the whole curve if its warm
i will be awful-stay in that 2.00-2.50 rnage for spot prices.
   i think the prompt is out of the woods-if so long as we have normal
weather nov cash will be ok -wont trade lower than oct cash as long as we
have big incentive to roll storage mar/apr? i bailed. basically washed. in
the long term its prob ok but they arent gonna let me make any serious money
on it in the next few weeks prob longer so why have it on esp when this
winter is such a big discount to next-i guess theres some risk h/j moves
higher if they y on y sprds come in much?? not sure so i bailed. i dont
disagree with you on the calender sprds but i just dont think the entry pt
is attractive. about the only thing im running is nov long agaisnt dec and
jan shorts. pretty netrual no big bets on for now-first time in a awhile.
nothing is that obvious to me. if mktstays sort of balanced until end dec i
mite take a shot on the long side late dec early jan. i struggle paying
sucha  big premium for the forward curve

Sorry,sorry, sorry.
Havent had internet access at home for past 5 weeks.  Much easier to write
these at home as when I'm done trading I don't want to look at my computer.
For november, very neutral.  Cash is impressive.  Agree shutins, switching,
and some weather are making market look more like equilibrium.  Think with
cash/futures at 20 cents, x/z looks crazy.  As soon as z becomes prompt,
the fear factor/risk premium of it will decrease and the whole winter will
come off.  Like your h/j trade.  Hard to see it really being worth 9 cents
at settlement.  Been buying a lot of y/y cantango as I think next summer
will be a piece but longer term gas story still very real and customers
know it.  Wouldnt be surprised to see 2/3 go to 50+.  I think x has some
room to go up, but not a lot.  Dont want to play the market from the long
side as been burned before trying to get long a market that is still in a
downtrend.  Seems like the curve will just keep rolling down with each
expiry.  All the winter months might settle 2.25.  As such, the best thing
to be short is jan.

"Greetings","Hi John,

The events surrounding the Enron demise are quite disturbing not only to
me but to many of us over here.  Our hearts go out to all the employees
who will not only loose their employment but also most, if not all, of
their savings.  As you know, I've always thought a lot of you; not only
for your trading skills, but also as a person.  You are one of the
largest and most influential traders in the market, yet do not have the
annoying ego so often found in traders of your stature.   I'm absolutely
sure that you'll do well no matter where your career takes you.  I just
wanted you to know that if there is ever anything I can do for you,
please don't hesitate to call.  This is not a solicitation for
employment.  This is from a person who always felt you treated me
honestly and fairly and if the occasion arises, would like to
reciprocate.

"NETCO","The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"RE:","Dear Mr. Arnold:

Thank you for your email.
Yes, recruiting season is now in full swing.  I am now waiting to hear from
Ms. Chenee Franklin, hoping to secure an interview.  Eva was very helpful
and informative; through her I learned a good deal about Enron's trading
businesses.
Once scheduled for an interview, I would appreciate it if we could talk over
the phone at your convenience.

Again, thank you, and I will keep you updated.

Sincerely,

   Gad:
   Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva
   referred
   you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I
   was
   planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't
   know.
   I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program
   in
   addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an
   offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate
   recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk
   via
   phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good
   opportunities here.

      Dear Mr. Arnold:

      I was referred to you by Ms. Eva Pao.  I am a second year MBA student
   at
      Harvard Business School, writing to express interest in exploring
      potential
      employment opportunities with Enron.  In particularly, I am
   interested
      in
      derivatives trading.

      I have attached my resume for your convenience. As you can see, my
      professional experience has been in a variety of roles within
   financial
      institutions and specifically, managing a currency trading-desk,
   before
      starting my MBA.

      I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you or with one of
   your
      colleagues, on a formal or informal basis, who might be in the Boston
   or
      NYC
      areas in the next few months.

      Thank you for your time and consideration.

      Sincerely,

      Gad Caspy

The Enron deal at Elba Island amounts to a sendoout capacity of 160mmcf/d for 17 years. This will be tough to fill as the majority of existing supply exceeds the max heat rate-I would look for Enron to get out of this in some way.  Enron is currently having discussions with El Paso as to whether this contract goes into effect Oct 1st 2001 or Jan 1st 2002. Elba Island has recently said that they will be running in Q4 although many still doubt it.

Attached is a file that lists the terminals, their capacity owners, facility owners, expansion plans, and supply situation.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
""It's not getting any better,"" said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
""They've been cut off from so many people,"" said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
""We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,"" Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating ""evolving."" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal,"" Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a ""due diligence"" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. 
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. 
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. 
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. 
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. 
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. 
""The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. 
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN 
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. 
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. 
""This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business,"" said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. 
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""There's nothing like accounting to scare people,"" said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
""Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is,"" said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
""The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars,"" said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
""We're trying to figure out a good play,"" said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
""People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it,"" a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, ""We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides."" 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. ""Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds,"" said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
""A lot of the guys are still very skeptical,"" said a bond trader at a New York bank. ""But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds."" 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
""We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive,"" the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal,"" said John Sousa. ""I can't elaborate any further at this time.""
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. 

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron ""locked down"" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from ""pending""' or ""threatened"" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving ""the perceived liquidity crisis,"" the source said.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.





ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.


Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.



Getting it done

_______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a ""crapshoot"" as to whether the deal gets done.

""I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term,"" he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. ""Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle.""

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

""Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it,"" Hilton said. ""If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache.""

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with ""the
parties involved in the transaction"" related to the structure of the
deal.



Top Of The News 
Enron In Free Fall 
Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET 

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush <http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/12/gwbush.html> and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. 

Dynegy's (nyse: DYN <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=DYN> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=DYN>) buyout of Enron (nyse: ENE <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ENE> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ENE>) was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. 

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. 

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for ""personal reasons."" 

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. 

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. 

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. 

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. 

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CVX> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CVX> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CVX>), may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. 

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it ""markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world."" While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. 

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. 

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. 

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means ""intestines;"" they decided to drop the ""te"" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.

"RE: Neural Networks","John, here is a power point slide that provides a draft outline of the problem at hand.  It is very draft in nature but I wanted to get the working version over to you ASAP.  I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc....

I think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product.

I will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document. 

I will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc.

My Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto.  I may have an opportunity to build the southeast market by supporting John.

I am very grateful that I met you and other key Enron traders during this job search.

not necessarily looking for predictive power.  that's a 3 year project.  just for market making skillset.  The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias.

John, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject system to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to automate some aspects of you daily activities.  I will try to send you a few power point slides showing my initial thoughts on the system.

It appears that neutral network (AI is a subset of this class of learning systems) type of model that takes input from all available sources (including actual market feedback, weather and other fundamentals) and uses curve building functions and other existing tools as transfer functions, along with your own thinking (your processing functions that your neurons are wired up to do), could help the neural network to learn and eventually provide the necessary predictive power.

John,

I appreciate your candor.  While I acknowledge my lack
of industry experience, I would have no problem
putting in needed time to gain a full knowledge of the
underlying products.  I'm not too proud or too old to
do my homework.

I would welcome the opportunity to talk with one of
your associates in more depth and am available at your
convenience.  I plan to be in Houston September 25-27
and have a pretty flexible schedule.  I can be reached
by phone at 415.776.3035 or 312.286.8977.

Thanks again for your feedback.

"RE: Refco Update","Our initial proposal will be for them to keep all their commission and incremental float, and for Enron to keep our spread.  We have talked about it quite a bit and I expect that they will ask for more than this, but we would hesitate giving them the ability to widen our spreads as this could work against the venture if they got too greedy.  Do you have a preference to work into the negotiation?

Gentlemen

We met last week with their management and CTO. We have determined the hardware and software requirements for the deal.  We are in the process of drawing up a term sheet and proposing a financial structure.  We have set a meeting for Nov 12 in NYC to get into the details of financial terms and structure.

The deal is going well and we are working with the following hi-level parameters:
Initially 8 Nymex look-a-like-products: Natural Gas (prompt, prompt+1, prompt+2), WTI (prompt), Gasoline (prompt, prompt+1), Heating Oil (prompt, prompt+1)
2 customer buckets with different spreads and volumes: Institutional and Retail
Volumes for Institutional will be 1 contract moving towards 0.5 contract and 0.2 contract possibly to match Nymex mini concept, Volumes for retail will be 0.5 contracts moving to 0.2 contract to match Nymex mini concept
Data feed with price and volumes sent from EnronOnline to Refco system customized and powered by EnronOnline software
Initially target scope is designed for a capacity of 5000 customers, 500 simultaneous
Refco will take credit risk for their customers and post daily collateral with Enron
Refco will pay Enron a one-time license fee for a 3 year contract with an additional annual maintenance & support fee
Enron will keep all additional margin generated by the transactions and Refco will keep the commissions generated and float from additional margin held.

Obviously, the above parameters are the preliminary thoughts and subject to change and negotiation.  We are just beginning to model the potential revenue and cost streams and there will likely be some adjustments that will come out of this exercise.  There are also a number of alternative technology scenarios to pursue if we have more or less money to work with.

Please feel free to call me x36413 if you have any questions or comments.

Regards

John Cummings

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on a new credit line.
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above ""junk"".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1,"" and said it may cut Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper,"" Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
""I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow,"" said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" he said. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
""We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader),"" said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
""Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem,"" said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow ""purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market,"" according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
""I think if is too early to tell,"" Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. ""As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron."" 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. ""At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions."" 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
""Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine,"" he said. ""This is a big case, by any means.""

Savita,

Attached is the latest Robotrader spreadsheet.

As you may recall, we tried several different approaches to minimizing the cost of the market running up and then down again.

The solution which gave the best solution was also the simplest one.

Principles as follows:

- Basically an advanced Offset to Last Trade
- Definitions
	- Intensity: Measures the length of time between transactions as a rolling average over the last x number of transactions (the Intensity Factor)
	- Intensity Factor: The number of transactions used in calculating the rolling average Intensity
	- Dead Interval: The period of time in which (if nothing occurs), an event or transaction is deemed to take place.
	- Offset Reversion Ratio: The percentage by which the Offset will be reduced if a Dead Interval passes
	- Spread Minimum: The minimum spread which can be used.
	- Offset Minimum: The minimum offset which may be used.
	- Spread-Offset Minimum: The minimum amount by which the spread must exceed the offset
	- Spread Reversion Rate: The amount in dollars by which the spread will decrease if a Dead Interval passes
	- Position Sensitivity: The position which, if exceeded, will cause the V Factor Adjustment to increase
	- V-Factor adjust: The amount by which the Momentum will be increased if the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- Momentum: The measure of the degree to which the market is either just buying or just selling
	- Adjusted Momentum: A Momentum number which may be boosted, causing a larger price reaction when the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- Offset: The amount by which a bid or offer will be increased/decreased when a transaction occurs.
	- Spread: The difference between the bid and the offer
- General Principles and Mechanics
	- As each Sell (Buy) occurs, the Momentum decreases (increases).
	- The Adjusted Momentum is the same as the Momentum, unless the Position Sensitivity is exceeded.
	- If the Position Sensitivity is exceeded, then the Adjusted Momentum is boosted by the V-Factor Adjustment
	- The Offset is calculated by looking up the Offset value on a table for the specified Adjusted Momentum
	- The Spread is calculated by looking up the value to boost (decrease) the Spread on a table for the Specified Intensity
	- As the Intensity value drops, the Spread widens. As it increases, the Spread decreases.
	- In a running market, the offset will increase quickly. If it establishes a new level, the Offset will slowly decrease
	- If the market runs up and whipsaws back, the offset will stay large
	- If a market range trades, the offset will trend to zero.
	- If there are a large number of transaction in succession, the spread will widen
	- If there are a small number of transactions in succession, the spread will tighten.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Regards,

Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks
By Jathon Sapsford and John Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, and is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar with the matter. 
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but said he couldn't supply any further details. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favorite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, its finances remain sound. 
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier this month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal. 
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. Enron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a Sept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63. 
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was ""getting a bit more resistance"" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding, he said. 
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility. 
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lower rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses. 
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor confidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last week could impair ""Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."" 
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are doing business with Enron on ""essentially the same terms"" as they have in the past. ""There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,"" he said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's finances. 
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said. 
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. ""Confidence in this company was lost,"" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line. ""But confidence will be restored."" 
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have access to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines. Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illustrates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy markets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those are the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern. 
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No longer. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenues, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and selling stakes in energy producers. 
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at around 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke Energy. 
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a ""new economy"" Web-based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. According to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be valued accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the company's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its price then. 
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under strange circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in California's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial statements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's troubles were hiding in plain sight. 
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad. 
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter. 
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the company filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a ""senior officer of Enron is the managing member"" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron ""manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars."" It was, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund. 
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he severed his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this year -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had been done. 
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enron relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-footed hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission were left with many questions, and very few answers. 
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a year ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the company. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003. 
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be seen, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency. 
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and retired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times
Page 9, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billion in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today. 
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off commercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said. 
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting. 
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. Lately, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and two major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds 
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mutual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the havoc may continue. 
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embattled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to fund tracker Morningstar. 
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's halving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders. 
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m shares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn. 
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or 5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several leading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January. 
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are ""dated"", implying that the funds' positions in the company have changed. 
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said managers of the group's larger funds had been ""lightening up"" their Enron holdings this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagship Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say when. 
Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also declined to discuss his holdings, listed as 0.27 per cent of outstanding shares as of March 31. But Aim said the position had since been ""trimmed substantially"". 
Other top fund owners, as of the most recent filings, included the Alliance Premier Growth fund, the Janus Twenty, Janus Mercury and Janus Growth & Income funds, Fidelity Magellan, AXP New Dimensions Fund, Putnam Investors, Putnam Voyager and Putnam New Opportunities funds and Morgan Stanley Dividend Growth fund.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.
By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, the US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-wheeling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty. 
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these ""related-party transactions"". The departure of Andy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed. 
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity. 
""This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side,"" observes Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank. 
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle ""new economy"" magic on to old economy companies. 
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to develop energy trading. 
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy under-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it. 
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets. 
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. Employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they delivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: ""It was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."" 
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a ""loose-tight"" management model expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and McKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets. 
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative force behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years. 
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr Skilling once described the approach in this way: ""As long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you want around here."" 
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. The success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world's leading e-commerce company. 
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint venture with International Business Machines and America Online, the internet service provider. 
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most powerful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of America and Boeing. 
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation. 
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust and Azurix. ""They went after too many things too quickly,"" says Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency. 
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparency. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed. 
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many investors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management: ""The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable."" 
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. ""The problems, in our view, stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills,"" argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""Power plants in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant energy business."" 
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enron Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This helped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise. 
""They over-promised on the new business they created,"" says Chris Bartlett, a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the company. ""Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the broadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."" 
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-the-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith Barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the past three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets. 
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team will have to tighten up.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - Enron asks banks for additional credit.
By SHEILA MCNULTY and GARY SILVERMAN.

10/29/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price. 
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its financial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to ""establish additional lines of liquidity"". ""Once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest,"" Mr Palmer said. 
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October 16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders' equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, who was forced to take a leave of absence last week. 
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically ""junk"" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade. 
""Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations,"" said Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney. ""These activities require at least an investment grade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements."" 
The controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron flickers, Page 22.

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.



USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.
By Janet McGurty

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of investors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business dealings. 
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its credit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial transactions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the past week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States is not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the market volatility that drove earnings last year eases. 
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other power producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy. 
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry. 
""One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth,"" Patterson said. 
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. And plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off. 
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED 
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets. 
""It's a different place,"" AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powerful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Baltimore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which planned to make an equity investment in the company. 
""The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. economy, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver,"" said Christian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman. 
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES 
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. 
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth, according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise. 
""Calpine does it already,"" he said, referring to the California-based independent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates contracted out. ""What drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level,"" he added. 
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark spreads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies. 
SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES 
As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning back to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line. 
""Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward revision of earnings guidance."" said Patterson. 
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America. 
CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distribution units as well as other international investments. 
Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings. 
The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time. 
""The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders,"" Allegheny said.

Enron seeks new credit line; reportedly for 1-2 bln usd

10/29/2001
AFX (AP)
Copyright 2001 AFX News; Source: World Reporter (TM)

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line, a spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. 
The company is in talks to raise between 1-2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days, it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying.
The deal, which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence, would supplement existing lines. These are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears. 
Enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.

Enron Said Seeking New Credit Lines
BY LAURA MANDARO and ALISSA SCHMELKIN

Copyright (c) 2001 Thomson Financial, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly negotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it drew down billions on its existing lines. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies with the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, with an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding ""in addition to derivatives and other structured product exposures,"" according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loan facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 million loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also participated, Securities Data said. 
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that ""in order to dispel uncertainty in the financial community,"" it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line. 
""We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity -- that's nothing out of the ordinary,"" said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. 
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the departure of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. 
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and services, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines. 
""Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested along with Enron in some of its partnerships,"" said Ms. Applebaum. A spokesman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did not know the amount of its exposure. 
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 million of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $100 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also have some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said. 
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

USA: Enron in talks for $1-2 bln credit line - WSJ.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion and could close a deal within days, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. 
According to officials close to the situation, the new credit would supplement existing credit lines, largely tapped out after the company drew down about $3 billion last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery investors' fears, the Journal reported.
The paper said that an Enron spokesman had confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but could not supply any further details. 
Confidence in Enron has been shattered following disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships. Its stock has tumbled amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company's ousted Chief Financial Officer's links to some of the partnerships.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd , said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy giant Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant. 
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate of Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning thermal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
""We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power market,"" a Teijin spokesman said. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers. 
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus. 
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's existing power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron. 
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan. 
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by June 2002. 
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times

c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron? 
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron's arrogance had grown even more quickly. 
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for electricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets. 
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''People want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's the American way.'' 
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are mounting. 
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion in shareholder value. 
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low of $15.04 earlier in the day. 
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resume day-to-day control of the company. 
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, available for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilling could not be reached. 
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas. 
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today faces a potential cash crunch. 
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash. 
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, which have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide. 
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a producer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year. 
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations. 
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are they good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger said. ''It's got everyone scared.'' 
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company. 
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the company's sales and profits. 
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible downgrades. 
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Kansas City, Mo. 
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reliant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do business with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down,'' he said. 
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading company had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business. 
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements. 
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask. 
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statements parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances. 
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water company subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference. 
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial officer when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholders' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships. 
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report. 
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its shares rose. 
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors. 
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company. 
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.'' 
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot we can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the company expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year. 
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its other partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to clarify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note after the call. 
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, a higher-than-normal volume. 
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay said in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.'' 
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enron's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years. 
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy. 
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.'' 
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said. 
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say. 
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable.'' 
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits. 
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy. 
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist. 
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices. 
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. Enron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-quarter of all trading in the United States. 
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-growing portion of the nation's power. 
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline company, to move into the trading business. 
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in February, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, it had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products.'' 
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involvement. 
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its investment-grade credit rating before that. 
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's credit. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy markets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that positions that should offset each other do not. 
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share price, could rebound. 
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enron's plight.

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corporation are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers. 
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies. 
Q. How did those investments do? 
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that. 
Q. Why can't that be discerned? 
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely. 
Q. Why were they so complicated? 
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule. 
Q. Who made money from these transactions? 
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors. 
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now? 
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important. 
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron? 
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships. 
Q. How did Enron do? 
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
Q. How did that happen? 
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings. 
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules? 
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Investors Seem to Ignore Discouraging News
By MICHAEL BRICK

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Investors sent stocks markedly higher last week, despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, strengthened by triple-digit rallies on Monday and Thursday, ended the week nearly back to its level of Sept. 10, one day before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on Sept. 10.
Investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected. They also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago, at some companies by more than 30 percent. 
All the bad news, investors seemed to surmise, meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy, with tax breaks, spending and lower interest rates. 
The Dow average gained 341.06, or 3.7 percent, to close at 9,545.17. The Nasdaq composite index rose 97.65 points, or 5.8 percent, to 1,768.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 31.13, or 2.9 percent, to 1,104.61.

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take

The vote is in. Lockheed Martin Corp. won the coveted right to build the nation's next-generation fighter aircraft, beating out Boeing Co. for what could be the biggest military contract ever. 
Culminating a five-year battle between two of the world's largest defense contractors, Pentagon officials picked Lockheed Martin to begin development of the Joint Strike Fighter, with plans to purchase 3,000 of the planes at a cost of more than $200 billion.
With the potential for foreign sales topping another $200 billion, the contract is considered the most lucrative in U.S. history. ""This really is the contract of the millennium,"" said Christopher Hellman, analyst with the Center for Defense Information. ""Nothing has or will come close. ""

Ford Settles Lawsuit Over Faulty Part 
In the largest automotive class-action settlement in history, Ford Motor Co. will reimburse customers who paid hundreds of millions of dollars to replace a faulty part that caused their vehicles to stall. 
It was uncertain how many consumers would qualify for reimbursements in the range of $160 apiece. 
The settlement caps six years of litigation. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the cost to Ford would be as high as $2.7 billion.

AMR Posts Record Loss in Quarter 
Even though more Americans are flying again, the airline industry continues to reel and its problems are expected to worsen this holiday season. 
AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, the world's largest airline, posted a record loss for the third quarter, even after getting $508 million in federal financial aid. 
Although the number of passengers has kept growing each week since the Sept. 11 attacks, about 20% fewer people are flying. 
Less than a month before the busy Thanksgiving weekend, American Airlines says advance bookings for November are down 6% from a year earlier. 
Meanwhile, the airlines are now reporting a little-noticed aspect of the government rescue package: They have to pay federal taxes on the cash grants.

ITC Says Imports Hurt Steel Industry 
The International Trade Commission ruled that foreign imports pose a serious threat to the domestic steel industry, paving the way for punitive sanctions that are likely to raise steel prices and intensify trade tensions with Europe and Asia. 
The independent U.S. agency has until mid-December to provide the White House with a list of proposed remedies, which could include import quotas or hefty tariffs on foreign steel. 
Beleaguered U.S. steelmakers applauded the decision. 
President Bush, who instigated the ITC investigation, is expected to approve the protective measures, though critics warn they could harm a weakened domestic economy and complicate efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks.

Shares of Enron Plummet Amid Losses 
Enron Corp.'s stock was pummeled by investors following disclosures of losses and shrinking shareholders' equity related to failed investments and a complicated hierarchy of limited partnerships used to shelter some Enron assets. 
The stock slide was compounded by disclosure of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into two of the partnership arrangements and by Wall Street worries about future cash flow and credit problems that might be caused by the investment vehicles. 
Two conference calls with analysts and investors failed to calm nerves, and several analysts lowered their recommendations on Enron. 
Enron has reiterated that its finances are strong. And although analysts note that Enron's core businesses remain sound, some analysts doubt that the usually taciturn company has revealed all of its problems. 
To mollify investors, Enron replaced its chief financial officer, who until recently headed the two partnerships the SEC is eyeing.

Pentagon OKs Northrop Bid for Newport News 
Northrop Grumman Corp. was all but assured of winning the bid to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. as the Pentagon endorsed the deal and the Justice Department, citing antitrust concerns, blocked a rival bid by General Dynamics Corp. 
It marked a stunning turn of events for Northrop, which got the nod to acquire the Virginia builder of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers despite having been the underdog. 
The Los Angeles-based defense contractor made an unsolicited offer for Newport News after the shipbuilder had inked a $2.1-billion deal with General Dynamics. 
Separately, Northrop said third-quarter earnings fell 22% because of a large drop in pension fund investments.

Hollywood Production Jobs Fall to 4-Year Low 
Skittishness following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has exacerbated an already slow season in Hollywood, pushing employment in the movie, television and film industry to a four-year low in September, state statistics show. 
Cutbacks and delayed projects by the major studios has trickled down through the industry, leading to a spate of layoffs at small companies that provide equipment and services for the industry.

Grammy Officials Urge Greene Settlement 
High-ranking officials at the Grammy organization recommended a settlement of more than half a million dollars to resolve sexual assault and battery allegations against the nonprofit group's chief executive, C. Michael Greene, Grammy sources said. 
The proposed settlement, subject to approval by the group's board of directors, has ignited an internal revolt, with at least a dozen of the 41 trustees privately calling for Greene's firing, the sources said. 
Greene declined to comment. Attorneys for the Grammy nonprofit group previously denied that Greene assaulted or had any sexual contact with Jill Geimer, the Grammy executive who has threatened to sue over Greene's alleged misconduct.

EMI Ousts Record Label Executive Nancy Berry 
British music conglomerate EMI Group sacked Nancy Berry, the vice chairwoman of its worldwide Virgin Records division. 
Berry's exit came a week after the London-based record company ousted its global record chief, Ken Berry, who is Nancy Berry's former husband. 
The shake-up follows a dispiriting period for EMI, including a disastrous sales debut from pop icon Mariah Carey, who suffered a nervous breakdown months after signing an $80-million contract with the company this year. Nancy Berry spearheaded the elaborate marketing campaign for Carey's album, ""Glitter,"" which has sold fewer than 400,000 copies since its Sept. 11 debut.

Management Buyout of G&L Realty Approved 
Stockholders of G&L Realty Corp. approved a management-led buyout of the real estate investment trust despite a higher offer by a rival group and concerns that the deal unfairly favors top executives. 
The company's co-chairmen, Daniel Gottlieb and Steven Lebowitz, plan to take the small Beverly Hills-based company private after a majority of shareholders backed their $12-a-share offer. 
The management-led offer triggered a shareholder lawsuit this year that claimed G&L's board breached its fiduciary duty

Internet Archive Turns Back Web Pages of Time 
The nonprofit Internet Archive launched its so-called Wayback Machine, allowing Web surfers to check out most Internet sites that have vanished and older versions of sites that are still around. 
The San Francisco effort is the brainchild of Brewster Kahle, a millionaire technologist who wants to preserve the Internet's ephemera for generations to come. 
Like many Internet pioneers, however, Kahle faces unfamiliar risks along with the opportunities: the archive might be the most massive violation of copyright law since ownership rights over words came into being. 
More than 10 billion pages are available at http://web.archive.org.

Job Cuts, Make-Over in Store for Sears 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. is getting a new look, borrowing from competitors that have been biting into Sears bottom line. 
In a bid the company says will increase operating income by $1 billion during the next three years, Sears will look more like a mass merchant, with more self-serve areas and centralized checkouts. 
As part of its financial realignment, Sears will cut 4,900 jobs in the next 18 months. 
The company's challenge, analysts say, is to offer something unique within its niche of serving middle-income consumers--an ever difficult proposition against innovative rivals such as Kohl's and Target.

Devon Energy makes building its own with major lease

(Copyright 2001)

HOUSTON is known as the ""Energy Capital of the World."" And a glance around the downtown skyline proves the nickname is appropriate. Houston skyscrapers bearing the names of Enron, Chevron, Exxon and Shell make significant contributions to the view. 
Now another name is being added to the downtown mix, enhancing the energy capital image even further. The 36-story Two Allen Center has been renamed Devon Energy Tower.
Devon Energy has just signed a lease for 193,000 square feet of space, more than doubling its presence in the building, and as part of the deal, Devon gets to put its name on the structure. 
The lease also gives Oklahoma City-based Devon the right to take more space in the 1 million-square-foot building, at 1212 Smith St. 
Devon recently announced its plans to acquire Mitchell Energy & Development, but it will maintain Mitchell's offices in The Woodlands, said Klay Kimker, manager of office administration for Devon. 
Kevin Snodgrass and Tim Relyea of Cushman & Wakefield represented Devon in the transaction. Paul Frazier and Margaret Sigur negotiated the deal on behalf of TrizecHahn Office Properties, the owner of the building. 
TrizecHahn owns both the Allen Center and Cullen Center office complexes, a total of 6 million square feet of space in downtown. The TrizecHahn office space is nearly full right now, but Enron will be vacating large amounts of space there next year when the nearby Enron building is complete. 
Teamsters to build facilities 
Teamsters Union officials are planning to build new headquarters facilities after the union sells its building on the Katy Freeway. 
To replace the Katy Freeway building, the union expects to build two smaller structures near Bush Intercontinental Airport to house different chapters, said A.W. Parker, secretary treasurer of Local 968. 
Parker's group is expecting to build a 13,000-square-foot building at Ella Boulevard at Beltway 8. 
Another Teamsters group has purchased 4.5 acres on Beltway 8 at Diplomatic Plaza Drive, in the World Houston Business Center. The land was purchased from the Licha Family Trust. Tony Patronella and Marc Drumwright, both of Southwest Realty Advisors, handled the sale. 
Chicago firm buying property 
A Chicago real estate investment firm is on a quest to acquire suburban office buildings in Houston. 
ML Capital Ventures has purchased two small office structures: the 71,736-square-foot building at 5500 Northwest Central Drive and the 66,338-square-foot building at 5301 Hollister. The building on Northwest Central Drive is the headquarters of BJ Services energy company. 
Mike Luecht, president of ML Capital, said his firm will acquire two additional Houston office buildings before the end of the year. 
ML Capital, which has been in business for eight months, will exceed Luecht's initial plan to buy more than $22 million worth of suburban office space in Houston in the company's start-up phase. 
Luecht said his firm was bullish on two types of real estate: buying warehouses in Chicago and buying office buildings in suburban Houston. Houston's economy has been adding jobs and it is a promising market that is overlooked by many investors, Luecht said. Many investors have been too slow to forget the devastating meltdown of Houston realty market in the 1980s, Luecht said. 
In its most recent deal, ML Ventures bought the 5500 Northwest Central building in partnership with Avgeris & Associates of Chicago. Tom Bousquet of CB Richard Ellis brokered the deal. 
Woodlands opens new section 
Several $1 million home sites go up for sale this weekend as The Woodlands opens a new section of its Carlton Woods gated community. 
The premium lots will be facing the new Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course. 
Custom lots will range in price from $150,000 to $1 million and range in size from one-fifth of an acre to two-and-three-fourths acres. 
The Carlton Woods community is the first gated community in The Woodlands and has been well received by upper-end home buyers, said Paul Lazzaro, vice president of marketing for The Woodlands. 
Thirty-two homes are under construction in Carlton Woods and all of them are priced at more than $1 million. 
A total of 208 lots have been sold in Carlton Woods, which opened about a year ago.

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning levels.
By ROBERT CLOW, SHEILA MCNULTY and JENNY WIGGINS.

Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy price for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plummeted. 
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announced a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-balance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. 
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to buy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the company on negative watch. 
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis. 
""What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business,"" said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. ""In a situation like this, cash is king."" 
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business. 
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that. 
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up well. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal. 
Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its most recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer. 
Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity investments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a certain level. 
Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which should have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed. 
The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market.

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 
Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.
The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 
Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 
""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 
Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 
On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 
The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 
Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 
Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 
""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 
""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management.""

Enron Decline Continues

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 
""Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,"" said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. ""People are questioning the credibility of management."" 
The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 
Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 
Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ""a smart financial move,"" said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. ""It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital.""

Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 
The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 
Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 
Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 
""To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively,"" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 
But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 
""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin said.

""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."" 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 
In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 
""Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues,"" Dietert wrote in a report Friday. ""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off."" 
Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 
For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 
Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group.

Enron says Microsoft breached contract

Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in Houston this week, claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high-speed Internet service. 
The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would provide Internet bandwidth to Microsoft as it rolled out its MSN Broadband service. Enron's broadband network would link MSN customers in over two dozen states, including Texas.
Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other states for MSN. 
On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if it didn't provide an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, according to Bloomberg News. In the lawsuit, Enron claims Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project's first phase. 
The lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the MSN service in all but the 14 states served by Qwest. 
Enron officials declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was ""confident that we have upheld our agreement with Enron.""

How to Lose a War
By Frank Rich

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Welcome back to Sept. 10. 
The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani than waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactly zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (though one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). The Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had begun until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcement that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New Jersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary-school children again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things That Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not everything changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20. 
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particularly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic prudence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as speedily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's House ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine. 
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, ServiceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates, is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Hall Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees. 
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ridge. 
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam. A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administration from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- who have brought us where we are today. 
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. Ashcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perhaps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern. 
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credibility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance of science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospitals -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of all expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the Republican Bill Frist. 
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of public health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointee, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr. Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag. 
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Glazier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even though her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international and domestic terrorism.'' 
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't respond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she adds, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents). 
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, there wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of homeland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to define Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it was ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion. 
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Brokaw -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers. That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment. 
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Taliban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''instead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.'' 
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & Shoulders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

10/27/2001
The Daily Telegraph

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to ""dispel uncertainty in the financial community"" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: ""We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."" 
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called ""failed investments"".

INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3.

10/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned by Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday. 
They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buying the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. firms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial project, the source told Reuters.
The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank and Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added. 
At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel. 
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast. 
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the second phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility MSEB. 
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can no longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly. 
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract. 
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the matter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That six month period expires on November 19. 
Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indian government. 
TIME RUNNING OUT 
The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would also discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after November 19. 
""It is one of the items on the agenda,"" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying. 
The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. 
""The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands down,"" the paper added. 
A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. 
The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far. 
The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity, but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interest. 
They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount. 
Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 percent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel. 
Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $1 billion, the paper added. 
Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment.

Enron sues Microsoft for breach of contract ; Move could block high-speed service
The Associated Press,Bloomberg News

10/27/2001
The Seattle Times
Fourth

(Copyright 2001)

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for broadband services, in a move that could temporarily block the largest software company's MSN high-speed Internet service in some U.S. regions. 
Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in the 14 states -- including Washington -- where Qwest Communications International operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.
Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to offer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential customers in 29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner. 
""We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers,"" Visse said. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing company policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest energy trader. 
Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported. 
Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal, Dow reported. 
Alternative browser-users denied Microsoft entry 
NEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to millions of people who use alternative browser software such as Opera and told them to get Microsoft's products instead. 
The decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community that Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Microsoft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browsers after all. 
Browser products affected by the shutout, which was triggered by a face-lift of the MSN.com Web site, included Opera, Mozilla and Amaya, said Kevin Reichard, editorial manager for Internet.com's BrowserWatch site. 
Mike Pettit, president of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft group, urged state and federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusing Microsoft of anti-competitive practices.

MicrosoftSF to shut down; Sony will run retail store 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Sony will take over a retail store it manages with Microsoft next month, when the biggest software maker's Xbox goes up against Sony's PlayStation 2 in a contest for control of the $20 billion video-game market, a Sony spokeswoman said. 
The two companies agreed to shut down MicrosoftSF, a retail outlet in Sony's San Francisco Metreon entertainment complex. It will be replaced with a Digital Solutions electronics store run by Sony on Thursday, Metreon spokeswoman Kirsten Maynard said. 
In April 1998, the companies said they would open the store that displays and sells Microsoft products alongside Sony electronics that run the software. In March 2000, Microsoft announced the Xbox, a game console with an advanced-graphics chip that goes on sale Nov. 15. 
""A lot has changed with both companies,"" Maynard said. ""It sort of became not-a-fit anymore."" 
Sony Metreon won't carry the Xbox or Game Cube, a new video console from Nintendo that goes on sale Nov. 19, she said. Officials at Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment on the shutdown.

S&P and NYBOT Launch New Index Futures and Options Contracts

New York, NY, October 19, 2001 - The New York Board of Trade (NYBOT)
, in partnership with Standard & Poor's, began trading futures contracts this morning on the S&P Commodity Index (SPCI) - a new standard for commodities pricing. Officials from the New York City Mayor's Office for Economic Development as well as NYBOT and Standard & Poor's presided over the launch.

Standard & Poor's, a leading provider of global financial information and investment analysis, and the New York Board of Trade, a global marketplace for alternative investment products, developed the SPCI to bring greater definition to traded commodities as an investable asset class. The SPCI was introduced at a ceremony at NYBOT on August 9, 2001. The SPCI futures and options allow managers and investors to add real diversification to their portfolios through a single, transparent access point to the investment opportunities found in commodity futures markets. 

""The launch of this new product so soon after the events of September 11, and on a trading floor so imaginatively developed before the event, allowing NYBOT to start trading so soon after the loss of its facility in lower Manhattan, is a testament to the strength and the resilience of New Yorkers,"" said Michael G. Carey, President, New York City Economic Development Corporation. ""Let no one doubt that New York is and continues to be the financial and trading capital of the world.""

""To contribute successfully to long-term portfolio goals, an alternative asset should have certain key characteristics, namely a proper benchmark, transparency, liquidity, simplicity, cost efficiency and flexible trading capabilities,"" said NYBOT President and CEO Mark D. Fichtel. ""SPCI futures and options are among the few investment instruments that meet all the criteria for a real alternative asset. We believe that these new contracts will prove particularly valuable to investors and managers who need alternative investment strategies in these difficult economic times.""

The NYBOT SPCI futures contract lists six active contract months (January, February, April, June, August, November). Expiration is the second Friday of the listed futures contract month, and the contract is cash settled. The futures contract is valued at $100 x the Index (current contract value approximately $100,000). Trading hours initially will be 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (New York Time). Options on futures are also offered (see contract specifications). 

""SPCI futures and options give investors a direct means to obtain exposure to a diversified commodity basket,"" said Robert Shakotko, Standard & Poor's Managing Director of Index Services. ""Investors around the world recognize the S&P reputation for equity indices and index products. We now bring these same business strengths to commodities."" 

The SPCI tracks 17 commodities in six sectors including grains, meat and livestock, metals, softs (coffee, sugar, cocoa), fibers, and energy. The index utilizes real-time prices of the relevant futures contracts traded on the commodities futures markets in New York and Chicago. Key features of the SPCI include its geometric calculation methodology and a weighting adjustment that eliminates double counting of upstream and downstream commodities. 

The new SPCI futures and options contracts will support and enhance other index-linked investment products. They offer an easy and efficient way to manage commodity index funds, commodity-linked insurance products, or commodity exposure in multi-asset products. As with its equity indices, Standard & Poor's has initiated a licensing program for the SPCI directed at financial institutions that might use the new commodity index as part of an innovative investment product.

End-of-day index values and index history are available through both the S&P Index Services website at www.spglobal.com <http://www.spglobal.com/indexmaincommodity.html> and NYBOT's Website at www.nybot.com <http://www.nybot.com/>. The SPCI is calculated every 15 seconds and is available through traditional real-time quote vendors via the NYBOT; the ticker symbol will be 'I'. 

Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (NYSE: MHP), provides independent financial information, analytical services, and credit ratings to the world's financial markets. Among the company's many products are the S&P Global 1200, the first real-time, global equity index, the S&P 500, the premier U.S. portfolio index, and credit ratings on more than 220,000 securities and funds worldwide. With more than 5,000 employees located in 18 countries, Standard & Poor's is an integral part of the world's financial architecture. For more information, visit the Standard & Poor's Website at www.standardandpoors.com <http://www.standardandpoors.com/>.

The New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) is the parent company of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, Inc. (CSCE) and the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE). Through its two exchanges and their subsidiaries and divisions NYBOT offers an expanding range of agricultural, currency and index products. Information about the New York Board of Trade can be found at www.nybot.com <http://www.nybot.com/>.

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count.

"REFCO Project Update","Gentlemen

I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.  We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.  Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.

To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.

All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.  Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.

Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical. 

Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.

Regards

John Cummings

"FW: New Multi-commodity Options Trading Products","
Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

"","John,

As you are aware, there was some confusion on the 2 Peoples trades we did on 10/15/01.  We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.  

A person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn't a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn't know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn't know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn't confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven't talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.

Amy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).  So the trade is okay, but it could have been a $500,000 hit to Mike's book.

Please let me know if I can do anything.  Thanks.

John

"URGENT - ENA Associates & Analysts"," 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.

These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.
