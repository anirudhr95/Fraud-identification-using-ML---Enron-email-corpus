"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thanks,

Subject:	Waiting on your reply -Stack Users

If you're receiving this email its because we're still waiting on a response from you.  Please reply to this message ASAP.  See below for details.

Thanks,

Dan

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

"NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

Subject:    All Employees Participating in the ENRON Domestic Benefit Plans


Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan, write or call:

Enron Corp Shareholder Relations
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying costs.

"INC SHEET AND INC SHEET POSITION MANAGER AND P&L SHEET","Ryan,

I made two styles of inc sheets for our future use.  One of them is an inc sheet, position manager, and profit/loss sheet in one...please note that the colors are a little busy and it may be simplified.  The other is broken out with the inc sheet similar to yours with a few additions and then the position manager and profit/loss sheet on a different worksheet.  See what you can do to improve them...Obviously neither are fully integrated yet as I am a bit rusty on my excel skills.  Especially when it comes to macros.

If you want I can come in later today and we can work on them together.

"URGENT! URGENT! VIRUS ALERT!","Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :		Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the ""preview pane"" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

"Enron Elves","Hello all!

First, thank you for your generosity this holiday season, especially during this difficult time. Your gifts and donations will help bring holiday cheer into the lives of our three adopted families.

If you have chosen a gift tag from the tree: 
Please make sure your gift is clearly labeled with the recipient's name and a description of the gift. (We want to insure that all of the children have received gifts.) 
We ask that all gifts be wrapped and under the tree by Tuesday, December 18th. 
Also, if you have not already dropped the half of the gift tag into the red/gold box by the tree, please do so. This will not only allow us to keep track of who is purchasing what and for whom, but it will also enter your name into the drawing for Blazer tickets.

Once again, we appreciate your participation in our Enron Elves Event. If you have any questions or suggestions about ways we can help make our adopted families' holiday even more jolly, please let us know.

Happy Holidays!


----The Enron Elves Team----

==============
For your reference, below is some information about our adopted children:

The Roberts Children
Selena (9 year-old girl)
Sam (5 year-old boy)

The Zurita Children
Felipe (13 year-old boy)
Carolina (8 year-old girl)
Kimberly (5 year-old girl)
