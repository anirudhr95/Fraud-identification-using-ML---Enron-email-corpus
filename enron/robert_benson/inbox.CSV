"NOTICE TO: All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan","TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

"FW: Competitive Analysis Update #5- US Terrorism Attacks","From Kelly Holman

_______________________

A.	Market Updates

U.S. Markets

?	US equity and futures markets expected to reopen tomorrow according to SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.
?	The Group of Seven (G-7) major countries are in talks on emergency policy coordination to prevent further turbulence in global financial markets following the terror attacks against the United States.  No official word yet on coordinated intervention.  Greenspan still in Switzerland.
?	1PM CDT expected release AGA and IEA weekly data.

Europe
?	ECB Meeting tomorrow-possible coordinated interest rate reduction with US, Japan.  

Oil Markets

?	Bearish factors continue to carry trading: suspension of commercial air travel and possible mass cancellations once resumed; Falloff in energy demand due to shut businesses; Possible decline in equity markets and renewed fears over recession

Canada

?	Toronto Stock Exchange likely to reopen tomorrow, following US lead.


B.	Transportation/Infrastructure Updates

Gas/Power Infrastructure

o	Tight security persists; no other updates.

Refineries/Crude/Products

?	Tosco refinery in Linden NJ still closed.  
?	Force Majeure likely to be declared by major crude product receivers in US ports; 
?	Louisiana Offshore Oil Port operations suspended pending security inspections.  Expected to reopen today with operations largely unaffected.
?	Jet fuel- monitoring military stockpiling.  Dedicated refineries in the Middle East to support US forces in region.  Disruption to travel bearish effects for jet fuel.


Air Travel

?	Aviation experts are speculating that the system of getting the country's air transportation system fully restarted may take a week to finish.  Officials cautioned it could be several days before flights are allowed to resume as normal in order to institute tougher security measures.  
o	All airlines have to account for all their aircraft.
o	Some of the airstrips that accepted jetliners may not have the refueling capacity to relaunch the planes.
o	Some of the crew members that are stranded with their planes may not be able to finish their flights under federal rules outlining the number of hours they can work in a 24-hour period (of course, this will be a moot point in a few more hours).
o	However, some airlines, including Southwest and America West, have announced plans to resume flights at noon today.

Maritime Transportation Conditions

?	Port decisions on re-opening being made at regional, not national level. Major ports escorting all tanker vessels one-by-one into port with heavy inspections.
?	US Coast Guard maintains restrictions on all West Coast ports.
?	Valdez, Alaska closed until further notice.  Honolulu, Portland open.

Rail Traffic

?	Union Pacific - running normally
?	Burlington Northern Santa Fe - no information
?	CSX - suspended freight into and out of Boston, NY and Washington yesterday; remainder of network operating under very controlled circumstances and at reduced speeds. 17 CSX TransFLo terminals have also been closed.
?	Norfolk Southern - operations are normal this morning, except for the North Jersey Shared Asset Area, where operations remain suspended.  

Border Crossings

?	No updates


Political Update

o	Secretary of State Powell says we ""need to treat this like an act of war.""
o	National editorials place strong calls for military retaliation.
Bush to speak at 945am CDT; Mineta delayed.

"URGENT - ENA Associates & Analysts"," 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley

-----Original Message-----
From: Allan Stewart [mailto:astewart@pira.com]
Sent: Friday, September 21, 2001 2:29 PM
To: Imai, Rika
Subject: PIRA Update


Rika,

Wanted to give you some updated thoughts. We normally do not gyrate this
much, but much uncertainty and volatility now.

Firstly, we are writing down demand sharply in the U.S. and around the
globe. We are thinking that the US economy will be ugly and outside of a few
of the Asian Tigers, worldwide economic activity will be even uglier. Oil
demand much weaker but geopolitical issues likely to keep oil prices firm.

In US -  we are now thinking as bad as down 3.5% to down 5% for 4Q01 GDP.
Coal just died as a result of this and an MSHA upward revision in production
of some 12 MT! Throwing in the towel on coal prices. East could easily lose
another $5/Ton.

I told Rogers by email we are now thinking that we could finish up next
winter with gas inventory of ~ 1.3 TCF. While we are still refining our
thinking, that is a shocking number. It says that yr-on-yr you would lose
3.5 BCF/D of summer injections next summer. It says that the odds of a
recovery of gas prices in 2002 are now looking quite bleak. It says that
longer dated gas prices could be in under pressure. Up until now, we thought
that drilling sector hit could clean this market up enough to get firm
prices by summer 2002. Now we the odds are looking bad.

Lastly, emissions -- I am scheduled to have a reasonably high level
discussion with Senate Environmental committee. Despite the third priority
(1st - Economy; 2nd - Security; and 3rd- Environmental), we are still
thinking that enough noise will be made that we are going towards a 6 MM Ton
SOX budget by 2007. That is likely bullish unless you discount future values
heavily, which we do.

Allan Stewart

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Subject:	New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and will eventually have them on a daily basis.

United Way 2001

As of 11:00 am this morning, EWS had reached $1,257,644.44 in pledges, which is 98.58% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000 and our participation rate is 75.12%.  While yesterday was the official end of the campaign, EWS and Enron, as a whole, remain short of our goals, so the online United Way pledging system will remain open through Friday, August 31.

If you have made your contribution, THANK YOU!  However, there are still over 1,000 EWS employees who have yet to log on to  https://hrglobal.enron.com  
and indicate a decision.  If you are one of these employees, please take a few minutes to impact the Greater Houston area in a positive way through a contribution to the United Way.  Further, if you have problems accessing the system or don't have time, please call or e-mail Eric Thode (ext. 3-9053) with your decision and he will log it in for you.  The system will then send you a confirmatory e-mail that you can check for accuracy and keep for your records.

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Enron's Emissions Group is a market leader in many regional and national emission cap and trade programs including the national SO2 market and the Houston-Galveston Cap and Trade Program.  The Emission group is developing into a business that entails Enron's core skill sets.  The Emission group is developing origination, mid-marketing, and finance as well as continuing to focus on the trading side of the business.      

On January 1st, 2002, the Houston-Galveston Mass Emission Cap & Trade Program begins in our backyard.  This program is designed to reduce the emissions in the Houston-Galveston area by 90% by the year 2007.   The program includes Harris county and the surrounding seven adjacent counties.  Enron has emerged early as the dominant player in this cap and trade program.  Enron has already become an active player by making the initial trades in NOx DERCs (Discrete Emission Reduction Credit) market.  Enron has almost made numerous trades in the NOx ERC market.       

Trevor Woods and Michael Taylor have recently joined the Emissions Trading Group.  The group, which includes trader John Massey, looks to become a principal player in many regional and national emission cap and trade programs, including San Joaquin County and NOx SIP CALL.  

Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS)
ACCRO Phase III - IV  
We are pleased to announce that final acceptance has been received by our client Accroven SLR (50%Enron) from PDVSA-Gas (Venezuela's National Gas Company) for the facilities built and performance tested by our Accro Project Team. Thus completing the final major milestone on what must be considered to be one of EEOS's most successful projects. 

Although contracted as one $320MM project, the work had to be managed as four distinct jobs. The prime site, at Jose, consists of a grassroots 50,000 bpd NGL's Fractionation Plant plus Offsite Refrigerated Storage; the latter facilities, being contained entirely within PDVSA's existing live plant, had to be built entirely under PDVSA's Hot-work Permitting system.  In addition, the site was under constant threat of disruptive action by very vocal and active Unionized workers. Thanks to the negotiating skills of our Site Manager, Tony Burke, they were shut-down only 25% as much as three adjacent major projects .The secondary sites, at Santa Barbara and San Joaquin, contained two grassroots 400MMSCFD Propane Extraction Plants. Not only did their remoteness cause significant logistical problems for equipment delivery, but also both had significant labour relations problems peculiar to their own locations. San Joaquin suffered many days of Force Majeure delay caused by the disruptive action by several local community groups protesting lack of work.

Despite all the impediments of the local labour, logistics, and the usual customs clearance issues, the construction was essentially finished on schedule.

Commissioning and start-up brought new challenges with erratic feedstock qualities testing both the design and the expertise of our start-up crews. It is a tribute to both, that all performance tests were passed within 48 hours of receiving a reasonably stable supply and the design flow rates, and that the plants have remained online since, or available, with minimal hiccups, generating significant income for our client.

Congratulations Accro Project Team!
Bob Meckna, Tony Burke, Andy Trevino, Dennis Zitterkopf, Bill Johnson and the rest of the team at site, in Houston, and from Teesside for achieving a remarkable success for which all participants can be proud; not only has the client gotten plants that exceed performance, the team was able to bring home double the budgeted profit.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

EES Europe Clinches Long-Term Outsourcing Deal With Guinness
EES Europe has signed a 15-year agreement to own and operate energy assets at the Park Royal Guinness Brewery in London. The deal means EES will source gas and electricity to provide steam, compressed air, chilled water and other industrial commodities to one of the largest breweries in Europe. EES will also have responsibility for managing a series of energy reduction measures at the plant, designed to improve performance and reduce costs. These measures will include investment in new boiler, refrigeration, compressed air and effluent treatment plant.

Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: ""Closing this deal was an outstanding effort by the entire team and is another example of the type of innovative energy partnerships we are forming in the marketplace. This transaction, coupled with the Sainsbury's deal, has caused the industry to start taking notice of EES, and I am confident more customers will be knocking on our door looking for similar structures.""
Congratulations to everyone on the team for their dedication!

Enron signs first long-term dry bulk shipping freight origination deal with major Japanese player
Enron's shipping freight team has signed a 10-year time charter deal for a 178,000 tonne capesize vessel with Lepta Shipping (with a performance guarantee from Mitsui & Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The agreement has a notional value of USD60 million and a mark-to-market value of USD 5 million.  The new agreement gives Enron the option to buy the vessel in Japanese yen after the third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up to an additional four years, if required.  The agreement takes effect from the latter part of 2003 when the ship itself, currently being manufactured in the Imabari shipyard in Japan or any similar substitute vessel, becomes available.  ""We are already in the process of onselling the first three years of our time charter above the curve,"" announces Pierre Aury, who heads up Enron's dry bulk freight team.  ""This deal gives us a strategic long ""days"" position and we now expect to close further deals as a result of our drive to commoditise more time charter transactions.""  The team is already exploring new time charter deals in the scarcer cape-size and handy-size vessel market.  A combined effort between the legal, tax, credit, transport support and structuring teams was instrumental in helping to book this deal just in time for Q2.  The shipping freight team is already working on a new structured deal with a major UK bank, so watch this space for future announcements...

Enron Credit Closes Deal with Enron's Shipping Desk
On 8 August, 2001 Enron's shipping desk bought a Digital Bankruptcy Swap (DBS) from Enron Credit in order to buy protection against a Japanese industrial/trading counterparty.  Under the terms of the deal the shipping desk will receive pay-out from Enron Credit when this counterparty becomes insolvent under Japanese laws and therefore hedges the counterparty risk that the desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty.  When the level of the shipping desk's mark to market profit rises above a certain amount, the desk will also have the ability to buy additional DBS protection.  Similarly, if the desk's contract with the Japanese counterparty terminates earlier, the desk can sell back any unused DBS cover to Enron Credit.

""We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us,"" said Pierre Aury who heads up the freight team. ""Another driver was that we felt we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning curve and develop shipping specific DBSs for the near future."" ""The hedge between these two commercial groups is another milestone in Enron's internal risk management.  With each commercial group having to optimise its capital at risk, the services and tools Enron Credit has on offer are an excellent complement to our already sophisticated RAC process,"" commented Ted Murphy, Head of RAC in Europe.

Congratulations go to Andrew Feachem who originated the deal for Enron Credit and Pierre Aury.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal. 


Enron Engineering and Operational Services
Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant.  Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK.  

John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility.  Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas.  Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit.  Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days.  EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly.

Enron Industrial Markets
The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities.  The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers.

Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly.  As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts.   Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps.      


IN THE NEWS
HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. 
Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman.
""Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman,"" Lay said. ""In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective 26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played key roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe.""

Enron Wholesale Services Best Practice Tips
Skytel is Enron's Preferred Vendor for Paging Devices
Included in the Skytel agreement are numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.  Enron also receives special discount incentives through year-end 2001, such as 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases and trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units.  Note:  Employees presently using both pagers and cell phones are encouraged to consolidate to one device by eliminating pagers and utilizing cell phones only.  Negotiations are currently underway to determine the preferred cell phone provider for Enron.  


Got a Great Idea for the EnTouch?   Do you have great news you want everyone in EWS to know about? Something interesting going on in power and gas markets? Or in industrial or global markets?  Send your ideas to Kathie Grabstald via email or call x 3-9610.

"Calpine Pre-pay Update","
Sorry for the delay in updating you, but we've spent this past week working through credit-related issues in support of this transaction.  I've attached our most recent communication to Calpine, and we have begun discussions on which market regions can be supported under this transaction by Calpine's merchant portfolio.  We will be meeting with Calpine next Tuesday to discuss the size of the transaction and determine the positions and regions that best suit Enron & Calpine.  We will continue to push for PJM-E and Nepool components based on our earlier discussions, but I suspect FRCC volumes will end up being much less than listed in the term sheet below.  

Dana, currently EES has subscribed for the 50mw RTC energy listed in the term sheet below.  I will follow up with you today to see if you have any interest in expanding our Nepool subscription.

Timeline is still a little uncertain, but we are pushing to close by Nov 15.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

- Jim


FYI - here is the most recent VAR analysis we ran on these positions (based on positions in the book on 10/4/01)

"RE: Multiple Stack Manager","Torrey,

The latter sounds like a great option, so please set up a second Stack Manager ID for Rob so that he can maintain two distinct stacks.  All trades on both stacks should go to his EPMI-LT-PJM book regardless of which stack ID is used.

Let me know if you need additional information, and thanks so much for your help!

Subject:	RE: Multiple Stack Manager

Casey,

Using one login ID, Bob can open two seperate Stack Manager windows on two PCs and set up different product filters on each for purposes of managing his different regions. The only drawback here is that whichever stack he closes last will save the product defaults and he will have to set up his seperate breakout for the other region each time he logs in (a proces that may take a minute or two depending on how many products he is managing).

To avoid this, we could set him up with a second Stack Manager ID and he could simply maintain two distinct stacks. If he would like a second Stack Manager ID, just let me know and I will forward the request to Stephanie Sever for setup.

Thanks,
Torrey

Torrey,

Rob Benson is currently trading two general power regions (PJM and New York) under one EOL ID.  He manages one stack manager of which all deals are mapped to his EPMI-LT-PJM book.  He would like to create an additional stack manager so that he can divide the two regions into their own stack and manage them on separate screens.  All of the deals would continue to go into the LT-PJM book.  Let me know if this would be doable and what I need to do on my side to help out.

Thanks!
Casey

"Organizational Announcement","
From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

"VAR Limits","	
As we near the end of the year, I want to make clear some individual VAR limits I have come up with as we go forward.  These will change from time to time as to allocate VAR to desks that are profitable and re-adjust VAR when desks are not profitable.  Please read carefully.  If you have any questions feel free to see me.  There will be penalties for not staying within your VAR limits.  I will be reasonable but fines will be assessed for repeated breakage.

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

"Important Message","It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is ""Mission: Possible"" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

Subject:	Fin spread description

Willis,

Take a look at the attached file with the proposed long description.  With the spread functionality, the West Hub product must be active on EOL.  Also, an Eastern Hub financial product will need to be created under the Fin Swap product type in order for the spread to work, even though it may not be used.  The spread is calculated East minus West.  Call me with any questions.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Rogers,

Wanted to make sure that I mentioned that we have redone our balances
initially and they are showing something even uglier than we had discussed
.. something like a 1.3 TCF EO March 02. That would mean a loss of some 3.5
BCF/D of injection demand in summer of 2002. Not surprising, we are probably
going to revise our prices down and throw out the V bottom and grab a long,
wide U bottom .. no $3 prices for 2002. You know what we really mean. UNT
was rallying today at over $8. This thing could almost as ugly as the last
down cycle.

Regards,
Allan

"TEESSIDE POWER STATION -- UPDATE","
The funerals of Andy, Darren and Paul, who tragically lost their lives in last Wednesday's explosion at Teesside Power Station, will be held this week at the following times:

Andy Sherwood	2.00pm, Wednesday, August 15
St  James Church, Hartlepool

Darren Higgins	9.15 am, Thursday, August 16
St. Andrews Church, Teesville, Middlesbrough

Paul Surtees		1.30 pm, Thursday, August 16
Easington Church of the Ascension, Easington Colliery

We know that everyone at Enron will want to remember the colleagues we have lost at this difficult time, and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends.

We are considering how best to commemorate the lives of Andy, Darren and Paul, and will be discussing our ideas with their families, in due course.

Graeme White is recovering in Middlesbrough General Hospital where his condition remains stable and we are continuing to provide as much support as possible for Graeme and his family.

The plant remains off-line and Enron continues to co-operate fully with the Health & Safety Executive's investigation into the cause of the explosion.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

Importance:	High

I assume that since you didn't respond to my first two emails, none of you require access to stack manager.  If this is incorrect, please respond to my previous emails.

Thanks,

Dan


Subject:	Waiting on your reply -Stack Users

If you're receiving this email its because we're still waiting on a response from you.  Please reply to this message ASAP.  See below for details.

Thanks,

Dan

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond
[Benson, Robert]  

I use the stack manager. I actually open 2 seperate stack managers.

"Code of Ethics -- What Exactly Did I Agree To?","

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

""It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable.""
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.


If you have any questions or comments about IT security or a related issue, please feel free to put them into eMeet (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf) under the ""IT Security"" category.  We'll monitor the site and respond to you there.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas

"NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY","The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

"RE: Priority of signing ISO-NE, NYISO, and PJM Transmission Tariffs"," This sounds correct, but we are in the process of calling the pools to obtain the documentation necessary now and I would think that you may as well execute the transmission agreements at the same time, since the transmission agreements are typically the most standard and usually do not require collateral, etc. as long as they are ST firm or non-firm.

Subject: Priority of signing ISO-NE, NYISO, and PJM Transmission Tariffs


Christi
 
In preparing our business implementation plan, I am trying to identify and prioritize the relevant transmission agreements for each of the 3 northeast pools.  My assumption is that, for pure internal transactions in each of the three pools, we do not really need to be a signatory to the respective ISO transmission agreements, and thus signing of these transmission agreements is not of the highest priority.  Does this sound correct to you?
 
My sense is that we only would need to sign on to the ISO transmission tariff to facilitate inter-pool transfers and/or to serve load in the regions.  Does this sound correct to you?
 
Please email or call me with any insights you might have.
 
Regards
John

"Accounts Payable Status","Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262 thousand
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123 thousand 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com <mailto:christa.winfrey@enron.com>.

"FW: LI and CO2","Wow - this is potentially HUGE.
I will keep you all posted as far as any developments.  I do not think this is on anyone's radar screen.

Willis - that would be great.  

We have some very tentative information on NYC:  there is a proposed law currently in committee at the NYC City Council level.  The law would require EGUs greater than 25 MW to reduce CO2 according to a schedule set out in the rule, eventually leading to a 30% reduction from 1999 levels.  A trading program would be possible and there is a fine of $5 for every ton above the allowed emission rates.  

We are working on getting a copy of the proposed rule and the status of the rule.  Will keep you posted.

Thx.

Thanks Mary.  Please let me know if you find anything else, and what you find insofar as similar developing legislation in NYC.  I will send you a list of threatened plants in Suffolk, if you are interested.

Here is a copy of the press release from Suffolk County.  I'm not sure if it is any more informative than the Electric Power Daily blurb.  Lisa and I are working on gathering more details for you.

Got it -- let's talk before I call the County office.  I have several questions myself.  Thanks.

http://www.co.suffolk.ny.us/exec/press/2001/emissions.html

Under the law taking affect March 1, 2002 any power plant in the county that generates over 1,800 pounds of CO2 emissions per Megawatt/hour would be fined two dollars for every ton above the limit. An additional $1 per excess ton would be charged in each consecutive year. The bill contains several alternatives to paying fines including buying emission credits through nationally recognized CO2 trading markets, investing in alternative energy sources or donating penalties to community environmental groups. The Suffolk County Department of Health Services will be responsible for compliance and will set rules and reporting requirements by October 1, 2001.

"Memo from Jeff Skilling","Dear Enron Employees:

I am saddened to inform you that there was an explosion and fire at our Teesside power facility in England at approximately 2:40 p.m. local time.

"Latest Marketing List","Please find attached the latest, and what should be the final for the immediate period of time, copy of the marketing list. Please filter the PA column by your name to double-check against the list you are currently working off of. 
There are some smaller subsids of larger companies previously assigned now listed. I pulled these subs in from the credit pre-approval list. I will be passing out draft contracts folders for these counterparties tomorrow to the people responsible for the respective parent companies.
There are some companies on your lists that do not have draft packets. These companies have NOT been pre-approved by credit, but credit is working on them now. Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc. are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit.
Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info. If you have any questions at all, please call me at 5-3614 or come by my desk at 06541 in the rotunda.

Thank you,

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone, 

	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game. 
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob. 

	We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

"SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

"NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY","In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

Rogers,

Wanted to make sure that I mentioned that we have redone our balances
initially and they are showing something even uglier than we had discussed
.. something like a 1.3 TCF EO March 02. That would mean a loss of some 3.5
BCF/D of injection demand in summer of 2002. Not surprising, we are probably
going to revise our prices down and throw out the V bottom and grab a long,
wide U bottom .. no $3 prices for 2002. You know what we really mean. UNT
was rallying today at over $8. This thing could almost as ugly as the last
down cycle.

Regards,
Allan

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

West Power
On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.  

Enron Freight Markets
Enron Freight Markets closed its first firm sale of transportation with Penske Logistics. Penske is under contract for the operation and U.S. distribution of Whirlpool appliances.  EFM will provide truckload capacity for Penske to serve Whirlpool.  The first lane that EFM will begin handling is from the southern California distribution center in Ontario, California to various northern California destinations.

News from the Global Flash

EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal
EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.

Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: ""Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia.""

German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory 
Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the ""heart land"" of Germany. 

Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive
On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.   Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.  True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.

Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'

The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  ""The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located,"" explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.  ""Other ""Raider Class"" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports.""  

While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!   Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

"FW: East Power Meeting","
Sorry!  You guys should attend as well.

Subject:	East Power Meeting

We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

"Team Captains Needed","Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.  Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.  

On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.  

We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).  We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.

"NETCO Implemention Template","From Kevin Presto:

Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.   I have added the additional columns everyone requested.   I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday.
 
With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following:
1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete
2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.

Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.

Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (Christi has started a list already).

The transmission agreement list attached can be used to prioritize or assign commercial people to transmission/pool agreements.  It is not correct on the timing under the pools, so don't rely on that column.

 

Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.

Subject:	New from FriedWire...


Good morning to all of you at Enron.
 
I wanted to make you all aware of two major new capabilities that FriedWire is soon to deploy.  One will be the new PJM intelligence module that will be an add-on to the existing Traffic Report.  The other is a brand new version of the Traffic Report itself that incorporates real-time electricity prices and news/commentary from THE major provider of this content.  FriedWire will be making some announcements shortly describing the strategic alliance between our firm and this content partner, and should be able to start showing the enhanced, jointly developed version of the Traffic Report in October.
 
Regarding the PJM module; we are now scheduling 30-40 minute, remote (Internet-based) overviews with clients who actively trade in PJM.  These will begin the week of September 24th.  If any of you or your colleagues would like to participate in a very informal session that looks at the capabilities of this new tool, please contact me and I can help set-up a date and time.  Some of the content and functionality in the PJM module includes:
 
}         Real time price and loadcharts that present current conditions in historical context
}         Real-time and day-ahead LMP data along with the public FTR data to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}         Easy interface for querying FTR data to provide competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}         Tools for valuing FTRs in the monthly FTR auction
}         PJM load charts displaying PJM ISO load forecast bias
}         Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}         LMP charts and maps
}         Customizable displays in the form of personalized Watchlists, tables and chart building tools
 
Thanks and contact me with anything you might need.
 
Take Care,

"New Source Review & Multipollutant Update","You may have seen recent media reports on the topics of possible EPA action on New Source Review (NSR) regulation and multipollutant legislation, so I wanted to summarize some of the important current developments:

New Source Review:

EPA was asked to conduct a 90-day review of NSR and come up with recommendations for the larger Bush National Energy Plan.   EPA held several public hearings and solicited public comments, which closed July 27.   Enron submitted comments (which I sent by e-mail on 7/30/01).   EPA has indicated that it will report to the President only on ""impacts of NSR on the power sector"" on August 17 and delay any specific recommendations for NSR reform until mid-September.

Stories in the past few days have suggested that EPA's findings will ""ease emissions standards"" on coal utilities. Such characterizations are somewhat slanted, as they are based on information coming from environmental groups who oppose any NSR reform -- but there is some substantive merit behind these reports as well.

NSR enforcement over plant modifications has been an extremely contentious issue for electric utilities, and many industry sources have been lobbying hard to relax EPA enforcement policy.  From an administrative perspective, this is a relatively easy reform for  EPA to tackle -- it would only require a change in ""guidance"" and not a lengthy regulatory process or legislation.   As you can see from the attached stories, environmental groups are extremely opposed to this type of action, and are using the media very effectively to put pressure on EPA against such loosening of NSR enforcement standards.
EPA will likely recommend a number of broader administrative and legislative changes to NSR, most requiring a longer trip through the legislative or regulatory process.   Such changes could include reforms to BACT/LAER analysis for new or existing sources, relief for cleaner sources, or standardization of some of the more arbitrary provisions of NSR.   Given the longer-term effort required, these proposed reforms may be newsworthy, but less likely to have an impact on the power sector in the short-term.

Some of the recent complicating issues have been calls from other industry sectors (manufacturers,  refining, industrial boilers, gas pipelines) for NSR relief.  EPA would prefer to address power sector issues only, but may be politically forced to make recommendations in other sectors as well.  It is not yet clear what sectors or what issues they will address.

Possible Outcomes/Impacts:  Large coal utilities have spent a great deal of resources putting pressure on the Administration on the modification & enforcement issues.  The issue is the easiest short-term solution to offer from a regulatory standpoint, so despite environmental group opposition, it is likely that EPA will recommend immediate action in this area, along with longer-term reforms.  For Enron businesses this means that coal, emissions and power trading should expect renewed strength in the coal generation sector, as older assets would face less barriers to extending their life.  Origination opportunities (plant upgrades, capacity increases) may increase as customers fears about enforcement actions subside.  Industrial and gas pipeline sectors may see relief in the modification area as well, if EPA decides to tackle sectors outside just power.  Particularly on gas pipeline issues, turbine maintenance issues may be clear-cut enough for EPA to make a simple , short term recommendation.

Multipollutant Legislation

Also making news lately were statements by EPA Administrator Christine Whitman, indicating that EPA plans to release a proposal to scrap existing emissions regulations (NOx SIP Call/126 Rule, Regional Haze, SO2/Acid Rain) for a more streamlined ""multipollutant"" plan.  Multipollutant strategies have been discussed for some time, but are becoming more newsworthy lately because they were included as possible options under the Bush Energy Plan, and offer potential solutions to NSR reform problems.

EPA's proposed elimination of existing air programs is not as drastic as it sounds -- in fact, it offers the opportunity to replace confusing, overlapping programs on multiple pollutants that are currently regulated or will soon be regulated by EPA with a more certain and flexible system.  Prospects for development of a multipollutant trading plan that reforms NSR are much less predictable, however, and will require a longer-term legislative effort.   

In September 2001, we expect to see release of EPA's plan, as well as congressional consideration of several pieces of multipollutant legislation.  We are working closely with EPA, the White House, and Congress on these issues and will continue to keep commercial and corporate groups informed on the progress of multipollutant strategies.   Unless political dynamics change drastically, we would not expect final action on multipollutant legislation this year.  As the issue evolves, we will be in touch with more specifics on the legislation and Enron's strategy.

If you have questions or would like more information, please contact me.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until fall 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

>One day when I was a freshman in high school, I saw

>I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football
>game with my friends tomorrow afternoon), so I
>shrugged my shoulders and went on.
>As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward
>him. They ran at him, knocking all his books out of his
>arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt. His glasses
>went flying, and I saw them land in the grass about ten
>feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible
>sadness in his eyes.
>My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and
>as he crawled around looking for his glasses, and I saw
>a tear in his eye. As I handed him his glasses, I said,
>""Those guys are jerks. They really should get lives."" He looked at me
>and
>said, ""Hey thanks!"" There was a big smile on his face. It was one of
>those smiles that showed real gratitude.
>I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where
>he lived. As it turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him
>why I had never seen him before. He said he had gone to private school
>before now.
>I would have never hung out with a private school kid
>before. We talked all the way home, and I carried some
>of his books. He turned out to be a pretty cool kid. I
>asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my
>friends. He said yes. We hung out all weekend and the
>more I got to know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my
>friends thought the same of him.
>Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the
>huge stack of books again. I stopped him and said,
>""Boy, you are gonna really build some serious muscles
>with this pile of books everyday!"" He just laughed and
>handed me half the books.
>Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best
>friends. When we were seniors, we began to think
>about college. Kyle decided on Georgetown, and I
>was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be
>friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He
>was going to be a doctor, and I was going for business
>on a football scholarship.
>Kyle was valedictorian of our class. I teased him all the
>time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a speech for graduation.
>I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there and
>speak. Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He
>was one of those guys that really found himself during high school. He
>filled out and actually looked good in glasses.
>He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him.
>Boy, sometimes I was jealous.
>Today was one of those days. I could see that he was
>nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the back
>and said, ""Hey, big guy, you'll be great!"" He looked at me
>with one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled. ""Thanks,""
>he
>said.
>As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and
>began. ""Graduation is a time to thank those who helped
>you make it through those tough years. Your parents,
>your teachers, your siblings, maybe a coach...but mostly
>your friends. I am here to tell all of you that being a
>friend to someone is the best gift you can give them. I
>am going to tell you a story.""
>I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the
>story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill
>himself over the weekend. He talked of how he had
>cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was
carrying his stuff home.
>He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile.
>""Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from
>doing the unspeakable.""
>I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy
>told
>us all about his weakest moment. I saw
>his Mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same
>grateful smile. Not until that moment did I realize it's depth.
>Never underestimate the power of your actions. With
>one small gesture you can change a person's life. For
>better or for worse.
>God puts us all in each other's lives to impact one another
>in some way.
>Look for God in others.
>You now have two choices, you can:
>1) Pass this on to your friends or
>2) Delete it and act like it didn't touch your
>heart.
>As you can see, I took choice number 1. ""Friends are
>angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have
>trouble remembering how to fly.""
>There is no beginning or end..Yesterday is history.
>Tomorrow is mystery. Today is a gift.
>It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends
>how much you care. Send this to everyone you
>consider a FRIEND. If it comes back to you, then
>you'll know you have a circle of friends.
>WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER, YOU'RE REQUESTED TO SEND IT TO AT LEAST

"Management Changes","I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

"FW: Economic impact of the terrorist attack","
FYI --- 

Summary from Industrial Markets ..  
 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Kristal, Yana  
Sent:	Monday, September 17, 2001 10:02 AM
To:	Enron Industrial Markets
Cc:	McMahon, Jeffrey; Bowen Jr., Raymond
Subject:	Economic impact of the terrorist attack

Although, the impact of the tragic event of September 11 on human life loss is immeasurable, its economic impact is also hard to estimate.  This event will have a dual economic effect; short-term and long-term.
The short-term effects will be driven by a decreased consumer confidence, decreased transportation spending, decreased tourism activity, huge losses in the airline industry, and deteriorating equity markets.  
Michigan Consumer Confidence survey for the month of August has already shown a 10-point drop, the survey was taken before the tragic event.  The major declining components of the survey included estimate of current conditions and a gauge of future expectations.  Conference Board Consumer Confidence survey is scheduled to be released on September 25.  The survey is likely to show even greater deterioration in consumer sentiment.  Consumer Confidence is the main driving component behind retail sales, retail sales of major ticket items are expected to fall in the near future due to the economic uncertainty.  Retail sales fell by 2.2 percent in January 1991, a time when Persian Gulf War began.  However, if the threat of future terrorist attacks diminishes retail sales are likely to bounce back.  Retail sales bounced back to a 1.6 percent increase in February 1991.
In a recent Gallup Poll survey taken post September 11, 50 percent of the respondents indicated that Tuesday's events make them less likely to fly.  Airline industry, already struggling before Tuesday, will be the hardest hit by this event.  On top of immense insurance losses, airlines already lost two full days of air travel.  Although revenue is lost, airlines still have to cover fixed costs during the grounding, estimated to be $100 million per day by one industry analyst.  
The effects on the tourism industry and hotels will be mixed.  Overall tourist activity will fall, as most people will be less likely to travel both domestically and abroad in the near future.  The past year has been one of the worst years for the hotel industry, and the loss of two historical landmarks in NYC, and heightened security concerns near major landmarks will drastically reduce tourist activity.  However, the hotel industry received a temporary uplift during the time when passengers were stranded and airports were shutdown.  
The immediate effect of Tuesday's event on the financial markets is most likely, a sharp sell-off.  Most of the global markets reacted to Tuesday's events by dropping 4-7 percent.   Effects on the U.S. markets, coupled with already troubled investors, can be expected to be much greater.  Most investors are likely to seek ""refuge"" in government bonds and gold, which remains at an 18-month high.
Both forest products and steel will be negatively affected in the short-term by Tuesday's events.  Reduced consumer demand for durable and non-durable goods, coupled with reduced business spending will drastically reduce purchases of homes, automobiles, and major appliances.   Also, international commodities might experience temporary price spikes as a result of increased freight rates and uncertainty over the political situation.
Many companies, such as Ford, were forced to suspend operations at several locations due to tightened border security and difficulties in obtaining parts.  Most carmakers experienced an interruption in production schedule, due to difficulties in transportation.   Some trucking companies might face Chapter 11 bankruptcy as difficulties in cross border transportation persist.
 Freight insurance rates and premiums have increased by a large amount as a result of the terrorist attack and are likely to remain at these levels, until political tensions subside.
The effects of the military action by the U.S. government on steel demand are likely to be very minimal.   Steel used in the defense industry makes up for less than 1% of the overall steel demand in the flat rolled steel markets.  So, even a dramatic increase in defense spending will have a minimal effect on the flat-rolled steel end-user demand.

The long-term effects will be driven by consumer confidence, fiscal policy and monetary policy.
Long-term consumer confidence will depend on whether consumers perceive this event as a one-time terrorist attack or as a precedent to a reoccurring cycle of attacks.  If this is perceived as a one-time attack and consumers expect quick return to normalcy, consumer confidence will quickly bounce back.  However, if U.S. gets involved in a long all-drawn out conflict consumer spending is bound to fall significantly.
Increased defense spending by the Federal Government is bound to help pull economy out of its current slump.  The newly reinstalled $40 billion package will help to create new blue-collar jobs, increase IT spending and cause a resurgence in construction spending.
Federal Reserve is determined to keep the economy from falling.   On Wednesday it concluded a $50 billion currency swap with the ECB and a $30 billion currency swap with the BOE in order to sustain liquidity in the currency markets.  
Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 50 base points before markets opened on Monday, in order to uplift investor confidence and ensure jittery investors in the Central bank's commitment to keep U.S. economy afloat.
In the long-term, effects of Tuesday's events on EIM products should be positive, coupled with the positive developments in the economy.  Demand driven economic recovery in the second half of 2002, will benefit all consumer demand driven products.  Lower interest rates will make it easier for companies to borrow and obtain new loans.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

"Tragedy Claims Life of Enron Employee","As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

UNITED WAY 2001

Building Houston's Future, Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, officially began Monday, August 6 and runs through August 17.  Enron's goal this year is $2.9 million and the EWS goal is $1,276,000.  Enron will match every employee's contribution dollar-for-dollar.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers and there's no better way than to give to the United Way, which touches over 50% of the families on the Texas Gulf Coast.

ON-LINE PLEDGING
We are again using an on-line pledging system.  Please click on https://hrglobal.enron.com to make your contribution and learn more about this year's campaign. You will need your GIS ID (which is your ""9..."" number, not your ""P..."" number) and password.  If you are not sure what your ID and password are, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the ""Accept"" button, and then click on ""Forgot your User ID or Password?""  If you have questions regarding access, please call the HRGIM help desk at ext. 3-5666.

Please make your electronic pledge no later than Friday, August 17.

APPRECIATION LUNCH
Rounding out this week's Days of Caring is an Appreciation Event today in Antioch Park from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  Come celebrate the success of Days of Caring, enjoy a free Chic-Fil-A lunch and watch a team of your coworkers compete against the other business units by creating building block structures that exemplify Enron attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  Jackie Martin, President of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, will join us in judging the structures. If you bring down the building blocks that were on your chair on Monday and donate them to our 2001 Adopted Agencies, you will be entered in a drawing for two free round-trip airline tickets anywhere in the U.S.


BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced today that Ivan Boileau has been named general manager of Garden State Paper, its recycled newsprint mill in Garfield, New Jersey.  Ivan was formerly the assistant general manager of Enron's Papiers Stadacona paper mill in Quebec City, where he was responsible for pulping, paper machine operations and maintenance. Under Ivan's leadership, Garden State Paper is expected to increase annual production, as well as produce higher quality recycled newsprint at a lower cost.
Enron acquired Garden State Paper in July 2000 and Papiers Stadacona in April 2001. The acquisition of both mills now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. Enron began offering various financial hedges to the Forest Products industry in 1997, and today is the world's leading provider of customized financial risk management services to both buyers and sellers of pulp, paper and wood products. In addition, Enron provides capital services, inventory management and long-term fixed pricing contracts for physical product for up to 10 years.

EIM Trading
Enron Industrial Markets Middle Office has a busy six months ahead of it as it works to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to handle the tremendous growth in the Industrial Markets Trading.  Key milestones will be the continuous improvement of customer service (both internal and external), the development/retention of team members, and the implementation of the first phase of new systems focused on electronic trade capture, robust physical order management, and settlements.  These milestones will be key to a strong finish in 2001 and being in a good position for the growth expected in 2002.


Enron Global Markets
Got Sushi?? 
Enron Global Markets is seeking to fill a key trading position in our Japan office.  We are currently interviewing internal candidates to take the lead on our commodity trading activities in Tokyo, Japan.  Tokyo is an excellent arena for us to apply our business model and this is an opportunity for you to add international value by applying your expertise in Enron commodity trading activities.

EGM Fundamentals
OPEC Producer Profiles
Columbia University summer associates Majed Limam and Noha Kasrawi have prepared a birds-eye view of individual OPEC producers and the types of crude they export. Working from public and proprietary information sources, they offer readers background information, a description of each player's role within OPEC, the structure of its oil industry, breakdown of its exports and synopsis of upstream, midstream and downstream sectors. Each country profile contains hyperlinks to crude assays and information on the marketing of their crudes, as well as maps. The results of their research can be viewed by selecting in-house analysis on the EGM Fundamentals webs site at: <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/>

Tracking Wholesale Gasoline
If gasoline rack prices are on your mind, a recently completed database that allows users to track gasoline 87 rack prices in eleven US cities, for both branded and unbranded gasoline, should be just the thing. The final product, developed by EGM Fundy staffer Jim Cole and Columbia University summer associate Majed Limam, gives a theoretical value for gasoline netback prices by subtracting tariffs and transportation costs from the average rack price for each city.  The output is displayed in graphical form in excel, but the major calculations and sorting occur in an Access database. The complete database is being updated continuously and will reside on the EGM Fundamentals web site in the nearest future. 

Worldwide Petchem Plant Shutdowns, Startups
The EGM Fundamentals Petchems team has compiled a master list of petrochemical plant shutdowns and startups worldwide from a wide variety of sources. This information, sorted by region and compound, allows users to confirm or anticipate changes in supplies impacting specific petchem markets. Updated weekly, the full report is available under In-house Analysis at: <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/petchems/>


IN THE NEWS

Deregulation Pilot Launch Successful: The Texas Electricity Deregulation Program pilot officially launched August 1 without a hitch. The pilot program, which hinged on the conversion of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas' (ERCOT) 10 control areas to a single control room in Austin, was delayed for two months due to computer problems. ERCOT is slowly transferring customers to their new providers and expect to complete the conversion by the end of August. The Texas electricity market will be fully deregulated on January 1, 2002.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Gas TPA agreement signed in Spain
Some very good news just in from Spain.  Last week, Enron Espa?a Generaci?n and Enagas reached a long-term agreement whereby Enagas will provide Enron Espa?a Generaci?n with regasification and transport services of natural gas of approximately 1,7bcm annually between Huelva and our planned combined cycle gas turbine plant at Arcos de la Frontera (Cadiz).  The services will begin in 2004, a date that coincides with our planned schedule for commencement of operations for the plant.  Well done to all the team.

Enron launches derivatives for three new tanker freight routes in shipping market
Enron's tanker freight team has this past week increased their derivatives portfolio (freight futures or 'swaps' of monthly contracts up to four months out) for three new tanker freight routes on EnronOnline. The tanker freight derivatives will be benchmarked against published indices for the three routes on the 'Baltic International' (BITRA) and International Independent Tanker Rate Assessment (IITRA) exchanges to help ship-owners (including oil companies), charterers, traders and even banks with exposure to the shipping market, mitigate the volatility of the freight element of tanker voyages traveling from Singapore to Japan (30,000 tonnes), the Caribbean to the US Gulf (70,000 tonnes) and Rotterdam to New York (33,000 tonnes).  Derivatives for the three routes will be managed out of the Singapore, Houston and London offices respectively.  ""Volatility of the tanker freight market has been as high as 62% on some routes,"" explains Scott Moncrieff, Enron's director of Liquids Freight Trading, based in London.  ""This has increased the importance of freight in relative terms on most tanker routes"" 

""In nine months we have already traded more than 3 million tonnes of paper freight, with a value of more than USD 14 million on the existing 80,000 tonne Sullom Voe (North Sea) to Willemshaven (Germany) route, and we expect to achieve similar levels of interest on our three new routes.  The tanker freight market is estimated to be worth more than USD 15 billion annually, and with increased liquidity being brought to the sector because of more players entering the market there's plenty of opportunity for us to build our business.""

The tanker freight team is also very heavily involved in the physical chartering of tanker vessels in Europe, The Americas, Arabian Gulf, Mediterranean, Far East and US West Coast, utilizing both the spot shipping market and Enron-controlled 'time-charter' vessels.

Nordic Pre-Pay Deal
The Nordic origination team has closed their first municipality power pre-pay deal in the last week. This is the first deal to be completed based on a financing structure that Enron Nordic Energy negotiated with Den Norske Bank earlier this summer. The deal is an important reference for municipalities that are interested in raising cash without selling their ownership in local power companies.

Steel Products
In March 2001 the European Steel Group commenced operations as an expansion of the successful effort underway in North America.  The group offers both physical and financial commodity grade steel products and serves as the only market-maker for a commodity market that is larger than that of crude oil.  The mission is to introduce the concept of indexation and financial contract to an industry where price transparency and risk management are virtually non-existent.  Physical and financial contracts for hot rolled and cold rolled steel are currently on offer via EnronOnline.  Interest from European producers and end-users is keen with the first financial transactions expected to close by the end of Q3. 

Since the team's inception they have successfully completed transactions with counterparties in Kazakhstan, Egypt, and China amounting to nearly 50,000 metric tonnes of steel.  

Forest Products
Enron's European Forest Products group is now trading physical market pulp to complement the financial derivatives products already offered for the last 2 years, increasing the volume under contract by 30%. 

Over the past six months, the group has recruited physical pulp traders to handle its day-to-day physical pulp trading business.  ""We have sourced long-term physical supplies of ""market pulp"" from around the world which will complement the financial derivative products we have already been offering,"" explains Martin Holmes, Director of Enron's European Forest Product Operations.

By trading both physical and financial contracts, Enron is pioneering more creative pricing in the industry by offering physical and financial cash and forward prices, as well as being the only market maker to quote longer dated swaps.

The group is also actively looking at structured finance opportunities including a number of inventory deals. These opportunities have arisen as the benchmark pulp price for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) has fallen by 45% over the past 6 months, leaving producers with high levels of pulp inventory in warehouses.

On 2nd July, the group launched the first standard contract for Bleached Eucalyptus (BEK) pulp on EnronOnline, and is actively marketing to industry brokers to adopt the contract as the benchmark index for pricing. The contract meets the commodity specifications of the BEK contract on the London Pulpex futures exchange, where Enron is the only market maker for all pulp futures contracts offered.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 

Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading 
The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal.  

Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative 
ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative.

This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay.

A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility.

The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team.   

eSource 
eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded ""Spending Wisely on Private Hubs"", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>.  

Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events.

Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees.  

Enron Freight Markets 
EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

See tab ""Rob"" in the attached spreadsheet. Same story on Portfolio #2: reducing gas position, lowers VaR. I have ran two additional scenarios for Portfolio #2 with 2/3 and 1/2 of the original gas position. Let me know if you have questions.

Fletch,
 
The limits have been quoted using the 10d-99 measure. However, UBS will use all three measures.
 
In Portfolio #2, Gas risk overweighs Power risk. NG-R4 correlation is 60%. If you reduce your NG position, risk will come down. See portfolio 2a with 20,000/day of J-V 02 Gas. Also, see my simple square root of some of squares calc in the updated spreadsheet.
 
I will run Rob's scenarios sometime today and send it to you.
 
 
Vlady.

Vladimir,
 
Which measure are we going to be using at UBS?  VaR on portfolio #2 dosn't make sense to me that adding gas short to same position as #1c. increases risk.  What's up with that?  Also, could you forward the results from Rob Benson's portfolio's to me?  Thanks,
 
Fletch

"NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY","Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website. These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.


Stack Manager Changes

Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website. 

If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font.

To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose ""Inactivate Stack"". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose ""Activate Stack"". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons.

					 

Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website. Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive. Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.


Website Change

Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.


If you have any questions please call me at 31787. Thanks.

"New Risk Management Policy","
Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") are exposed to market, credit, operational and liquidity/funding risks in the normal course of its business activities.  The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the ""Policy"") on August 14, 2001.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluated, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transactions via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes, and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of various risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management framework.  

Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Following an initial transiton period, various individuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk management framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an example of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.

If you have any questions, please contact Cassandra Schultz, cassandra.schultz@enron.com, 713-853-0429 who will put you in touch with the appropriate Risk Assessment & Control representative.  Note: this is a confidential policy, not for distribution to anyone outside of the Company without specific authorization from the Chief Risk Officer.

Kevin and Dana,

I thought you might be interested in seeing this report on the east. It will
be going out on the internet soon.

There is an interesting discussion on the drought and some drought impacts
which could hype the market abit. We did not intend to do so but nobody
really knows due to the lack of precedents. Before the drought
considerations, I would not have wanted to be short the whole Northeast
JUL/AUG. With those risks, it further makes the case. I personally think the
gas weakness will come late like last year (Aug/Sep/Oct). That is not in our
reference case.

Otherwise, this report is pretty bearish overall.

In the future, I would like to have ongoing discussions with you, and
establish parameters to make sure I economize your time and screen out
material you have little interest in. Obviously, we need to talk about only
those issues that have the highest expected values based upon our
assessments of the market fundamentals and the risks around those outlooks.

Thanks for establishing the relationship with us. Morris and I will work
hard to make it worth your while.

Regards,
Allan Stewart

"NJ Standard Offer","Hi all!
Attached is a breif outline on the NJ Basic Generation Service Standard Offer. - Please read.
Although this will have risks regarding capacity, ancillary services, and basis; This may be an excellent means to test the PJM standard offer market, since the minimum size required would be a 100MW slice.
The NJ Board of Public Utiltiy is currently shaping the auction process, and our regulatory people have been involved by interventions.  Jeff Ader (EES) has been working with regulatory to push that this should be a retail deal (similar to the retail customers that New Power won from PECO) and not a wholesale deal.  Is this the message we want to send? I suggested to regulatory that we propose that it should be split as to allow the best pricing for the NJ utilities and for everyone to be able to participate.  They suggested that if EES has more interest than EWS (apparently they wish to take 1000MW of this), that we should push the retail.  How would retail take the ancillary and capacity risk?  Are we set up such that EES would have a better chance of winning this?  What is our interest in taking on these exposures?

Can we meet later today, or tomorrow (Friday) to determine at least, how we want regulatory to proceed with the BPU.  Nick, Palmer and I had a conference call with regulatory yesterday, and want to get back to them as they will be filing with the BPU very shortly.

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

"Multiple Stack Manager","Torrey,

Rob Benson is currently trading two general power regions (PJM and New York) under one EOL ID.  He manages one stack manager of which all deals are mapped to his EPMI-LT-PJM book.  He would like to create an additional stack manager so that he can divide the two regions into their own stack and manage them on separate screens.  All of the deals would continue to go into the LT-PJM book.  Let me know if this would be doable and what I need to do on my side to help out.

Thanks!
Casey

"Moved, New, and Improved!","

Payables

Effective today, the responsibility for Accounts Payables has been moved to Global Strategic Sourcing under the leadership of George Wasaff.  He, along with the Accounts Payable team, is pleased to announce a number of system enhancements based on your valuable feedback.

Delegation of Authority 
iPayit now enables you to identify a delegate to code, review, or approve invoices on your behalf.  The system provides you with the flexibility to:
*  Identify a delegate as a coder, approver, or reviewer
*  Define the length of time that you would like to delegate your authority
*  Select whether the delegate will assume your approval amount, maintain their own approval amount, or assume a specific approval amount

Incorrect Company Code
Incorrect company code?  No problem!  The invoice will no longer return to Accounts Payable for correction before you are able to code the invoice.  iPayit enables you to select the correct company code and continue coding.

Additional Enhancements
*  In addition to Quick Forward, you can now Quick Approve invoices
*  Invoice comments can now be easily viewed from your in-box

Introducing iPayit
With so many new systems, you told us that it was easy to confuse Payables with iBuyit eProcurement.  To help clear up that confusion, we are pleased to announce that this new and improved version has a new name:  iPayit.  
*  To access iPayit, visit the iBuyit Portal or http://iPayit.enron.com.
*  Look for e-mail notifications from <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.  

Sneak Peak
For a preview of the enhancements and how to use them, click on the link below:
http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/ipayitsyspres.ppt

This is just the beginning!  We have created a committee that is dedicated to improving the Accounts Payable process.  We hope to engage you in this effort and plan to actively seek your involvement and input.  We look forward to working with and hearing from you about future enhancements that will enable iPayit to play a valuable role in your invoice payment activities.

For invoice payment status please call the AP Call Center at (713) 853-7127 or toll free  (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.

"EFCU E-Survey Response","
Enron Federal Credit Union
E-Survey Response

We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.

We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:

				2001	2000
	Friendliness		88%	84%
	Courtesy		89%	84%
	Knowledge/Training	86%	80%
	Range of Services	87%	82%
	Saving Interest Rates	66%	60%
	Loan Interest Rates	65%	58%
	Quality of Service	88%	84%
	Communications	84%	79%
	Web Portal		72%	N/A
	Service Wait Time	79%	68%


Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:

ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:

-  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions.
-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).	
-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.


Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.

Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible.


Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible.

We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:

-  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.
-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m.
-  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up.

"Crisis Management","From Enron Corp Business Controls


Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12.  All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804.  In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately.

With respect to employees stranded around the United States, we regret that these employees should make their way back to Houston or their home office as best they can via commercial airlines, train, or rental car.  Unfortunately, corporate and other private aircraft will not be flying until sometime after restrictions are lifted on commercial carriers.  Therefore, Enron corporate aircraft should not be counted on to provide assistance in this situation.

Subject:	FW: Niagara Mohawk - Electric Commodity Outsourcing Conference Call

Attached is a power point presentation (2nd file) outlining the terms of the deal struck between NiMo and Tractebel.  It looks like Tractebel has agreed to take the supply portfolio from NiMO at NiMO's cost, and then sell SOS load for a fixed quantity at fixed prices, with any deviations from that quantity priced out at the day-ahead LBMP.  Aso involves an index pricing mechanism tied to changes in NYMEX gas prices.  Finally, Tractebel is serving the MPS load (i.e., large customers) at a pass through of the day ahead prices.   I'll send in seperate emails the actual filing (including redacted contract) and affidavits covering the auction process and results.

	List of accomplishments for Rob Benson

	1. Made a fast and profitable transition from cash cinergy trader to term PJM trader.
	2. Current P/L is over $67,000,000, budget for the year was set at $15,000,000.
	3. No losing months, worst month was positive $2,700,000.
	4. Very high return on VAR, don't have actual numbers ( sorry ).
	5. Done two customer load following deals, both have turned out to be very profitable.
	6. Exceeded all EOL goals, both number of trades and volume. Each month I'm in the top 3 in east power for number of trades and volume.
	7. Have always stayed within my VAR limits
	8. I have become the market for all PJM trades, both on and off peak.
	9. My P/L has come from intra-day trading as well as an underlying fundamental position in both on and off peak. P/L did not come from just one big move.
	10. Have always put on positions based on my fundamental view, even if that view differed from others on the desk.

Kevin,
Fred asked me to send you the attached list of all the nuclear plants
ordered by NERC region based on proximity to NY and Washington.  Associated
with each plant is a risk level (high, moderate, low) and some factors upon
which the risk is based.
This is just a quick look at the plants.  If you want a more detailed
analysis of the risk of any of them, let me know.

Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The ""liquidity reserve"" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).

Subject:	UBS Trade Products

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"RE: What up ?","Hey Rob, sorry if I sounded a little weird on the phone the other night.  My
boyfriend and I were in the middle of a really heavy discussion when you
called.  He was standing right by me, (upset with me), so it was a little
awkward.  It was great to hear from you and I'd still like to meet you for a
drink sometime after work.  Take care, Holly

"Today's Events","The Enron Building in Houston will be closed for the rest of the day.  The offices in New York and Washington, D.C. have also been closed, and all employees have been accounted for.  We're asking all Houston-based employees not involved in critical operations to go home to be with their families.  We have every reason to believe the Enron Building is safe and secure.  Each Enron location has the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of their employees.  We know of no Enron employee or facility affected by today's tragic events.  Let's keep all the victims of these tragedies in our thoughts and prayers.  

If you have information that you believe may be relevant to this matter, please email john.brindle@enron.com <mailto:john.brindle@enron.com>.  For updates, view http://www.enron.com/corp/usbombingcrisisupdate.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

FERC Enacts Major Constraints 
on Wholesale Market



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis








AEP, Entergy Corp. and Southern Company told by FERC to charge cost-based prices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions. 

[News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a condition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade power in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would improve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test based on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in serving peak electricity loads. ""If you're big enough to control the market at the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you,"" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood. 

Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tremendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state regulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates, which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrinking profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this ruling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experienced in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can also be seen as another example of the ""big stick"" that the commission is using to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizations (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairman Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale markets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represents a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prompt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading. 

Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charge unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. Instead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Southern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) have been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately applying its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power separate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined that these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power ""test,"" a generator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electricity is ""pivotal"" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a price above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a dramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's main criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power needed in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal level. 

There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not eliminated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where the grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is significant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there are secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current ruling only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies may have previously established or will establish in the future are not impacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term contracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not included in the new ruling. 

The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposals to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charge for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered by an independent third party. 

The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique known as ""split the savings."" The methodology for this standard can get rather complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies identified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot power into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers who want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not producing or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions will be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decremental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transaction price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, sellers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous day and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potentially creates is an ""information advantage"" for buyers who have six hours to evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of the drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows the purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original incremental bid and competing around the seller's price. 

Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means is that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes they exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the commission determines that market manipulation has occurred. 

I made a previous reference to the ""big stick"" that FERC is carrying related to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood had threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger applications, advantages that the chairman equated with the ""new world"" of the deregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Company, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be subsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhibited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding national RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three utilities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Southern Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading and previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets over the next five years. 

Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single dissenting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evaluate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contested, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued statements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which the ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for possible litigation. 

Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a handful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illustrates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this could be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to other wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time. Third, the ""split the savings"" cost-based formula could become fraught with its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market over power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in the bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruling is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impacts AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deemed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have also not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three companies are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked that the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now will gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could substantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power market are conducted.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"FW: BECO Presentation","Gentlemen -

Attached below is a presentation on BECO T&D and Standard Offer/Default Service prepared by Andrew Kosnaski in our URM group.  Please let me know if you find this info useful as we are in the process of reviewing each major utility in the East.  We will have regional oversight with individuals accountable for specific regions/utilities.  To the extent the wholesale group can use this expertise, please feel free.

Thanks,

Subject:	BECO Presentation



Gentlemen : 

As discussed, the following are the 5 biggest risks and curve opportunities for BECO:

RISKS

Lower power price results in higher CTC beyond 2004 (can be hedged using existing short positions, URM actively pursuing)
Dramatic price increases causes huge congestion losses on commodity costs
Dramatic price increases cause subsidization of some customer classes by others (i.e. large C&I (Enron))
Lower than expected load growth results in higher future CTC/Delivery charges
SO deferrals lead to implemntation of 5 mil adder to delivery rates 

OPPORTUNITIES

Lower ROR in first unbundled delivery rate case could reduce delivery rates by as much as $1.50 - $2.00/MWh in delivery rates
Lower than modeled capital additions cause $1.00 - $3.00 decrease in expected delivery rates
Merger synergies reflected in 2005 rate case, result in reduction in delivery rates to reflect lower O&M and operating costs 
Arbitrage between regulated and retail gen rates to reflect congestion costs in 2004 and beyond (locational marginal prices)
Load growth can be higher than expected resulting in lower than expected delivery rates

I am having an Associate in our group work on a model that will allow us to run more accurate sensitivity analyses and will keep you all informed of the results.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me,

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

"Auction Employment Agreements with Condition Precedents","The following e-mail is to confirm my understanding of the following verbal assurances provided to me as part of the intent and conditions for signing a contingent employment agreement/retention package related to the sale of the Enron gas and power trading business (""Enron trading business"") to a new entity.

If a new entity purchases the Enron trading business and the contingent employment agreement executed on January 5, 2002 becomes a valid and binding agreement, Enron's management will not initiate a lawsuit to recover the 2001 performance bonus payments.
Enron and/or purchaser of the Enron trading business will seek approval from the bankruptcy judge of the 2001 performance bonus payments to eliminate any future uncertainty with respect to the validity of those payments.
To the extent the total retention $'s available for the Enron trading business employees is increased above current levels (from the leading bidder as of January 5, 2002), the intent of Enron's senior management is to make an upward adjustment to the individual employees who have committed to the new entity such that the employee maintains a substantially similar percentage of the total ""pool"" of retention $'s.

"quick PJM update","FYI if you haven't already heard...........A quick update on PJM:

1) GPU: The PA PUC ruled in favor of the First Energy merger, but deferred a rate increase.  Collaberative meeting are supposed to be taking place over the next month, but Enron's regulatory view is that a setlement will not be able to be reached.  The question is if First Energy is still interested in persuing the merger if a rate increase does not occur.  If the merger does not occur, I think this increases our chances of a deal to mitigate GPU's risk, if we can work out the credit issues.  GPU will probably be stalling most activity until a definitive answer is announced.  The NJ BPU will determine its verdict on the merger Jun 29.

2) PPL's (regulated) RFP is due tomorrow.  Enron will not be quoting, given the fact that the size is HUGE.......46,260,000 PV'd MWH, ancillary and ICAP requirements.  I believe PPL (unreg) will be quoting on a this, and are talking ot them about taking them out of some of the energy risk, leaving them more merchant MW.
Also , the quotes are due tomorrow, but must be held open until July 16 (what a deal!).

3) NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU) is looking to hold a joint competitive bid of energy and capacity to all default suppliers.  This is expected to be 18,000MW, which includes the load of PSEG, GPU NJ, and Connectiv NJ.  The BPU will be reviewing the proposals Aug 1.

I will be out of the office Wed- Fri, seeing Exelon, GPU, PPL, and UGI.

Not sure if you guys were aware of this.  I heard that Tractebel was unwinding a lot of their positions over the last couple weeks, and that the PSC shot the deal down (yesterday i think).

"RE: Multiple Stack Manager","Casey,

I have requested a Security Form from Laura Bacon for the additional Stack ID.  Once I receive, I will forward it to you.  Please fill out and have signed by appropriate signatory then return to Corporate Security.  If you will let me know when the form has been returned to Corporate Security, I will follow up with them as to when the ID has been set up.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465

Torrey,

The latter sounds like a great option, so please set up a second Stack Manager ID for Rob so that he can maintain two distinct stacks.  All trades on both stacks should go to his EPMI-LT-PJM book regardless of which stack ID is used.

Let me know if you need additional information, and thanks so much for your help!

Casey,

Using one login ID, Bob can open two seperate Stack Manager windows on two PCs and set up different product filters on each for purposes of managing his different regions. The only drawback here is that whichever stack he closes last will save the product defaults and he will have to set up his seperate breakout for the other region each time he logs in (a proces that may take a minute or two depending on how many products he is managing).

To avoid this, we could set him up with a second Stack Manager ID and he could simply maintain two distinct stacks. If he would like a second Stack Manager ID, just let me know and I will forward the request to Stephanie Sever for setup.

Thanks,
Torrey

Torrey,

Rob Benson is currently trading two general power regions (PJM and New York) under one EOL ID.  He manages one stack manager of which all deals are mapped to his EPMI-LT-PJM book.  He would like to create an additional stack manager so that he can divide the two regions into their own stack and manage them on separate screens.  All of the deals would continue to go into the LT-PJM book.  Let me know if this would be doable and what I need to do on my side to help out.

Thanks!
Casey

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"ConEd upcoming RFP","
Rob,

ConEd is looking for strictly indicative levels for monthly power in Zone G & J in NY for Nov-April 02, 5x16 for 100-300 MW.  They are going to send out an RFP in mid September, and are trying to determine the alternatives.  The possible products are:
1) Purchase monthly power in Zone G & Z On peak November through April, they would like to see our indicative offer on a monthly basis for both zones. 
2) Purchase a collar (potentially zero cost) whereby the cap price will be $15 above the underlying and the floor is approx. $10 below underlying.  These would be daily options with automatic exercise for 100 MW.
3) The final alternative would be a ConEd purchase of a daily call option with a strike $15 above the underlying and limit the # of times that they could exercise, e.g. first 5 times in a given month.
This RFP will be out the second week of September, if you could give us an indication as to what the pricing may be, then they could better determine which is their best course of action. 

Thanks.  Nick

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

New Power Plant Planned
for New York City



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from Energy Info Source] New York state's siting board approved Astoria Energy's plans to build a 1,000-megawatt power plant in New York City, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January. Astoria Energy hopes to have the natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle plant that will be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service by 2004. The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site preparation before it can begin construction, and still must receive some local permits from New York City. Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC, a privately owned energy development company based in Concord, Mass. 

Analysis: The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply problems that have been identified within this region. Like California, New York also suffers from a supply / demand imbalance. However, even if or when power supply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take their own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, transmission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting board to proceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it should not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city government. This could be easier said than done, as other planned power plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who ardently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant construction. 

The problems within the New York power market have been well documented. The state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since 1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven years since a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to open upstate. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new capacity in the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the state's ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for siting new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environmental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power. 

While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the problem appears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 report issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled ""Investigation of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region,"" highlighted specific capacity problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million people. These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City and Long Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmission lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York, but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily residential, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequently, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city. New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New York City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to increase by another 200 MW by summer 2002. 

Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of New York City and New York State. Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fast as new generation capacity was added. Demand over the course of 2001 was expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above regulators' earlier forecasts. 

It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Energy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energy-efficient and environmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. The company is a subsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy development company formed in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit will be a natural gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEd/New York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant reportedly will be $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary approvals on the local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003. Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the reduction of air emissions. 

However, despite this optimism, the community opposition factor should not be discounted, and there are several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that Astoria Energy could face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, which hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier this year. Sithe Energies originally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facility fueled by natural gas in Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand, and as a result would use local water resources for cooling purposes. Community resistance thus became an issue for the company, which altered its plans and began to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also powered by natural gas) that would only be operated in times of increased demand. 

As another example, environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week that essentially will block construction of small power plants in the South Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is a 44-MW plant, though at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than 80 MW. A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claiming (among other things) that the state had failed to perform adequate environmental-review studies. The groups claim that the state should test the plants for their output of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled in favor of the state, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of Appeals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups. The new ruling, which reportedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state must do unprecedented air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31. 

In a report issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSEG, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are ""serious problems with (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline infrastructure."" According to data included in a separate report by the New York ISO, which manages the state's transmission grid, between 1995 and 2000, while statewide demand in New York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by 1,060 MW. 

Consequently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York remained strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new generation capacity. However, Astoria Energy, which seeks to bring new generation online in New York that will be based on clean technologies, may still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the construction of any new plants in the region (with the exception of peaker units, whose output would be closely regimented). If plans for this plant are blocked or significantly altered, following the experience of Sithe Energies, the options to resolve New York City's supply / demand imbalance will once again become focused on a combination of other approaches, including conservation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives.

Casey,

Using one login ID, Bob can open two seperate Stack Manager windows on two PCs and set up different product filters on each for purposes of managing his different regions. The only drawback here is that whichever stack he closes last will save the product defaults and he will have to set up his seperate breakout for the other region each time he logs in (a proces that may take a minute or two depending on how many products he is managing).

To avoid this, we could set him up with a second Stack Manager ID and he could simply maintain two distinct stacks. If he would like a second Stack Manager ID, just let me know and I will forward the request to Stephanie Sever for setup.

Thanks,
Torrey

Rob Benson is currently trading two general power regions (PJM and New York) under one EOL ID.  He manages one stack manager of which all deals are mapped to his EPMI-LT-PJM book.  He would like to create an additional stack manager so that he can divide the two regions into their own stack and manage them on separate screens.  All of the deals would continue to go into the LT-PJM book.  Let me know if this would be doable and what I need to do on my side to help out.

Thanks!
Casey

"Robert Benson's Visa","Kevin:  Rob Benson called me this morning to ask about the process for Permanent Residency (Green Card).  At this time, I have been asked to hold on all new Green Card applications until further notice.

However, we might want to amend Rob's visa status from L1B to L1A, making it easier, faster and cheaper to process the Green Card, hopefully in the near future.

Rob was originally brought into the US in the capacity of Associate and this is why we used the L1B visa and not the L1A at that time.  Now that he is a Director, we should be able to amend his visa to L1A.  (The L1A is usually for Managers or above, or someone managing a function).

Do I have your authority to go ahead with the amendment?  The approximate cost is $1,000.

Thank you
Margaret

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Harassment Avoidance Training

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.

Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

"RE: Multiple Stack Manager","Casey,

Using one login ID, Bob can open two seperate Stack Manager windows on two PCs and set up different product filters on each for purposes of managing his different regions. The only drawback here is that whichever stack he closes last will save the product defaults and he will have to set up his seperate breakout for the other region each time he logs in (a proces that may take a minute or two depending on how many products he is managing).

To avoid this, we could set him up with a second Stack Manager ID and he could simply maintain two distinct stacks. If he would like a second Stack Manager ID, just let me know and I will forward the request to Stephanie Sever for setup.

Thanks,
Torrey

Subject:	Multiple Stack Manager

Torrey,

Rob Benson is currently trading two general power regions (PJM and New York) under one EOL ID.  He manages one stack manager of which all deals are mapped to his EPMI-LT-PJM book.  He would like to create an additional stack manager so that he can divide the two regions into their own stack and manage them on separate screens.  All of the deals would continue to go into the LT-PJM book.  Let me know if this would be doable and what I need to do on my side to help out.

Thanks!
Casey

"Court Decision on NOx - EPA Section 126 Rule","The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the EPA Section 126 Rule.  (As brief background, the 126 Rule would have required compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2003 in several northeast and Midwest states)

The Order states:  

""It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerators, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric generating units (""EGUs"") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one third of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid for sale per year.""   Translation:  This part of the order appears to ""vacate"" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.   For all other cogenerators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.   Impact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units.   EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.

""It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's decision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicable to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution of the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court.""  Translation:  This more significant part of the order ""tolls"" -- or puts on hold -- compliance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA resolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2001 ruling.     

Impact:  The practical effect of this part of the order will be to delay implementation of the Section 126 Rule until May 2004, when the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation is scheduled to go into effect.   The EPA will not be able to re-issue its Section 126 rules in a time frame that would require compliance before May 2004.  The NOx SIP Call would have supplanted the Section 126 Rule in May 2004 anyway -- what this ruling does is take away some of the uncertainty that existed for the May to September 2003 period (original effective date of the Section 126).   This means that generators in states not covered already by existing NOx trading programs (OTR NOx program) will have another year to comply.

I will forward any more detailed legal analysis as I receive it, but this is the latest news.

Please call if you have any questions.

Subject:	New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and will eventually have them on a daily basis.

"Lay It On the Line","
At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become ""The World's Leading Company,"" and what that means to me.

Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, ""Lay It on the Line"" for me by completing the attached survey.

I assure you that your individual answers to this survey will remain confidential.  The new Management Committee will use this information to help us identify immediate action steps to address your key concerns.  We will communicate the results to you, both positive and negative, and what we plan to do about them, as soon as we can.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us move Enron toward its new vision of becoming ""The World's Leading Company.""

We need your answers no later than Tuesday, September 4, 2001.

To access the survey, click on or copy the following URL onto the Enron intranet site: <http://etcsurvey.corp.enron.com/wi/p0731404/i.asp>.  If this link does not work, go to home.enron.com under ""New & Notable"" and click on ""Lay It On the Line.""  If you have problems with the survey, contact the HRGIM Help Desk at 713-853-5666.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"long-term PJM tolling opportunity","All

Learned of an opp today for a L.T. physical toll on a peaking plant in PJM.  Probably way too early for this, but we may be able to follow this one and act when we're further along.  Here are the details:

Plant is being developed by PPL - consists of 10 LM 6000's, due online by May 03 (~450 MW).  turbines will be on site shortly w/ construction due to start in April
PPL has entered an LOI to sell the completed plant to a team of investors led by John Hancock Financial (their Arclight division, or something like that)
seeking 20-25 year toll
Electric interconnection is South Acron bus (Lancaster, PA - eastern PJM)
Gas interconnection is direct to Columbia mainline
They are looking for an indicative number this monday, but admitted that it'll stretch out for at least a few weeks.

I'm in Houston through end of today, so please swing by or call me tomorrow at 978-449-9936 if you wish to discuss.  thanks
