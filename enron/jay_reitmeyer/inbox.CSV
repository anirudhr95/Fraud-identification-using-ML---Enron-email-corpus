Subject: Christmas stuff


Hi:
Hope you are all doing well. I liked the pictures you sent Mom of the girls at the zoo. She is amazed by the digital camera technology.
 
I found some nice sleeping bags for Reagan and Madison at JC Penney. They have animals on them and the pillows are the animal on the bag. They have a dog, bear, dolphin, frog and monkey. Which animals do you think each girl would like? I'll also get each of them some ""Little House"" books. What does Lauren need? What do the two of you want? Do you want a gift certificate for a restaurant so you can go have a nice evening together or something for the new house?
 
Mom is apparently telling both of us the same thing for Dad. Are you planning to get the clippers or shall we? I know he also wants some chairs for the patio. Let me know what you decide, and I'll get the other.
 
It's 284 days until my partner starts, not that I'm counting. I'm firing one of my nurses--actually we're transferring her to another department because she hasn't screwed up enough to fire but she is just not giving me the help I need to run a busy practice. My front office staff is finally catching on to things. So overall I think I'm calmer. We're going to Fredericksburg next week for a 3 day weekend.
 
Take care,
Meg

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update #26- US Response to Terrorism
Importance:	High


See below for update on situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress.

RJ

1. 	The War on the Ground

For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the special forces ""inserted"" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use the collected intelligence from various sources to ""snatch"" bin Laden and others, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircraft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikely to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.

Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that currently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the ground and some special operation forces ""in-country.""  Also,  British Special Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Advance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a week ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just west of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored AC-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan. 

The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower, ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups the US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In addition the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron around the HMS Invincible.

Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alliance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban.  

Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pakistan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and the actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a minimum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their intelligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.

2.	Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus measures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the $55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed. 
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preference over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to anesthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate ""bailouts"" that have not yet included anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospects:
?	Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are probably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directly in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big number if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes into Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be careful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is likely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn. 
?	Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the right medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you have already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the budget flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those who pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, but not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear that they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than ""the rich."" Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in. 
?	Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities for anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off your list. 
?	Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is sympathetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but the totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and health care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into shock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promised them support for some serious version of these programs in return for bailing out the airlines without clogging the debate with ""airline worker assistance"" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-house rebellion. 
?	Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be virtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut is something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, but if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worker assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been running into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal corporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay on something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is that companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as assets would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calculated benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirers depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses that companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop. 
?	Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vast assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by the same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and on which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no way to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the accelerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, there may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies. 
?	Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaurant and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handicap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on personal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make the cut others will not, but they can add up fast. 
?	Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional leaders that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the President would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade deals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democrats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. If he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn't cost anything.

We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week since the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time to waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact.

Hi Jay,
 
I'm running a test on the first page.
 
You should have received an E-mail. I filled out the first form and submitted it, just like someone registering would do. The system should have sent you an E-mail in the background.
 
In addition, you can check accumulative results at this Web Page:
<http://www.berean-houston.org//Judge_House/form_results.txt>
 
To test the page youself, go to the Judgement House link on our Web Site. Click on the link, and go to the page on Judgement House. Scroll to the very bottom of the page. You will see an asterix below the last line ""It does make a difference..."" Click on the asterix - that will take you to the test page.
 
Let me know what you think, and if you would like to see any changes.
 
Once we agree on that page, I'll build the second page for groups and we'll test it. Once that's done, then we'll create the links on the Judgement House Page.
 
In Him,
Bruno <><

It should contain hyperlinks to 2 separate forms.  Both forms can be e-mailed to this address... jennsreit@houston.rr.com <mailto:jennsreit@houston.rr.com>
 
 
""Or please fill out the on-line registration form for groups of 10 or more or individual families.""
 
 
The form can be in any format easy for you to design and should include the following information for groups:
 
Group Name
Contact Name
Number in Group
Desired Presentation Date
Desired Presentation Time
Contact Phone Number
*Contact Address
*Contact E-mail Address
*Additional Comments
 
*optional 
 
 
and for individual families:
 
Name

Number in Group
Desired Presentation Date
Desired Presentation Time
Phone Number
*Address
*E-mail Address
*Additional Comments
 
*optional
 
 
If you think that 1 form is enough and easier for you to create then we can use the one for groups.  I just want to make it as simple as possible for people to register and to not make it look like we are only accepting groups.  Use your judgement on that one, it does not really matter to me.
 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thank you for your help.
 
Always for Him
 
Jay
 
p.s.  We also might want to add the word ""strongly"" before recommended.  We want to place as many people in time slots prior to the event.

Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.

Each one has a different function depending on if we need the VCR for something. The original TV remote is only good for the source(toggles between the two different inputs). We have it figured out but anybody else would be stumped. We can't record HBO but that is not a priority. Hope we have no more problems. Give the kids a kiss for us. Love, Mom

I need to take a few hours off Tuesday afternoon after lunch.  I have some family business to attend to.  I should only be gone 2 hours or so.  Susan will be here to handle EOL.  Let me know if you have a problem with this.  I know I need to be here, but this is something I have to take care of and this was the only time I could schedule it.

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update- US Attacks Afghanistan #2
Importance:	High

Update below on ground campaign strategy & timing, as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments. Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.

Call with questions.

RJ
x39934


1.	Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate

With a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.

Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.

When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that ""reasonable elements"" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.

2.	Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure

Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.

Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.

3.	Pakistan Holding Steady- For Now

Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.

4.	Key Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?

There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.

"RE: Quick note","Jay,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I know that you are really busy and may not
have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the girls?
Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will be
pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send them
back with Mom and Dad.  If clothing is a good option -- what sizes?  Also,
does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry box
or anything like that.  I thought about buying something that could be for a
'big girl' instead of toys.  However, I am open to any and all ideas -- I
want to get them something they will enjoy.  If you don't have time to
respond, please forward this to Jennifer.

As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little
better.  I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my
breakfast since a week ago Monday.  I hope that this means I have turned
some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other
morning and fighting intense nausea every day.  Also, in the last week I
have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre.

Take care,
Lyn

"Photoshop 6 update","FYI:
If you are having, or have had problems with Photoshop 6, use the link below
to (according to Adobe) make it run smoothly with the 6.0.1 update.
Good luck...-bert-

Adobe has provided us with an update for Version 6 that takes care
of many little, shall we say, mishaps. 

To download the Photoshop 6.0.1 update onto a PC, go to:

http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/880e.htm

Then simply follow the instructions provided on Adobe's Web site.
Whether Photoshop is running as smooth as can be or if it's acting
up, we recommend that you install the 6.0.1 update; if not to make
the application run better, then at least to keep things current.

"Alas...","As they say, ""All good things must come to an end.""

Unfortunately, this is hardly ever more true than in the IT consulting realm.  I have been informed that as of this Friday (11/30/2001), my assignment here at Enron comes to an end.  Obviously, Enron's current economic uncertainty predicated the need to alleviate any and all ""excess baggage"" (read: consultant/contractor costs).

I truly have enjoyed my time here in the Gas Fundamentals group.  I have definitely learned a great deal from everyone, and hopefully have helped others to do the same.  I leave my contact information below, in hopes that if there is anything I can do for you in the future, you will not hesitate to get in touch with me (especially to let me know what time to be at Front Porch! ;-).

All kidding aside, this has been a great overall experience for me.  From now until Friday, I will be involved in handing off all projects/initiatives that I have been a part of (or directly responsible for).  If there is anything needed of me (between now and then), feel free to give me a call (x5-8885) or stop by (ECS 06836) prior to Friday.

Thanks for everything, and I wish everyone the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Sincerely,
Chris Hyde

"Re: My Resignation","Yeah, I think I shocked a lot of people, including Kam and others. Well, as shitty as the hours were, I actually liked risk.  I will be working in Risk at my new position at EnergyUSA.  However, a long day for them is 9-10 hours, which is more like a short day at Enron.  I think fewer hours and better pay will make working conditions much better but I am really going to miss a lot of the people that I worked with at Enron.  If was a very fun atmosphere to work in, even during the last few days with all of this merger talk going on.

    Hey Jay,

    Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.   No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.  They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a ""sexy"" company. 

    Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.  

    See ya,

"RE: Shut - In costs","Grigs,

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will ""water out"" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

Subject:	Shut - In costs

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  

Let me know your thoughts.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"commitment","We have made a commitment to each other and to God.  We have brought three
children into this world who deserve more than just THIS Christmas.  I don't
understand your feeling and maybe you don't either, but as far as I am
concerned we are in it together.  You might not let me in, but I will keep
trying until it gets better.  We have to get some help to deal with this and
help us get through this, but giving up on this family just isn't an option.
We can change it through compromise, but ending it will hurt our children
the most. Is that what you want?

"Enron Center South Occupancy","This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive","Howdy Ags!!

The two-year remembrance of the Aggie Bonfire collapse is upon us.  We still unfortunately have no Bonfire, but there is something we, as Aggies, can get together and do to remember our Bonfire 12.

Off Campus Aggies and The Association of Former Students are sponsoring the second annual Everyone Bleeds Maroon Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive. Now, through this weekend, with the help of The Reveille Club of Houston and many A&M clubs throughout the state and nation, we will remember and honor our 12 fallen Aggies.  

As you know, many around the state and country rallied around us at our darkest hour, and this is one little way, even when Bonfire returns, to show our appreciation for the support they gave us at our greatest time of need.  It's also a tremendous way to show we will not forget what happened on November 18, 1999.  Several of the families have expressed their support for this endeavor, and I think we need to do all we can to show them how much a part of the Aggie family they are, and how strong the Aggie Spirit is, was, and always will be.  

The need for blood is a constant battle for blood banks around the country.  The holidays are especially critical as donation levels typically fall while the need for donations actually rises.  In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, record numbers of Americans turned out to give blood.  What many may not know is that the blood collections are only good for a limited amount of time.  This week begins the period when many units of blood collected will need to be replaced. 

Last year, with very little notice, Aggies rallied to support our cause. We raised more 5,300 units of blood in 200.  Our goal for this year is to see 12,000 units of blood donated, and details on all the drives can be found at http://bleedmaroon.tamu.edu.   Also, most donation sites have a limited supply of Everyone Bleeds Maroon Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive T-shirts that you will receive in thanks for donating.  

Drives will be held on Saturday, November 17 in Angelino County (Lufkin), Dallas, Ft. Worth, Denver (CO), Ft. Hood/Killeen, Houston and surrounding areas, Karnes City, Kingwood, Longview, Marshall, McAllen, and New Braunfels.  Drives are going on throughout the week in Austin, Beaumont, TAMU-Galveston, Phoenix (AZ), and into next week in San Antonio and Nacogdoches County.  Phoenix has challenged alumni in their area from all Big 12 schools to donate as a sort of friendly competition.

Here on the Texas A&M University campus, you can donate at the Commons, Rudder, the Rec Center, Bush Academic Building, Duncan, Zachary, Vet School, Bio-Bio, Sbisa, and Wehner.  

Even if you can't make it out on the specific day to the specific place you can still get in touch with the blood bank in your area and ask to donate in the name of Everyone Bleeds Maroon. 

If you gave in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks you can still safely be a part of this event. Please pass this on and help spread the word.  We hope everyone will take the time to get out and give this week, and do their part in remembering the fallen of Nov. 18, 1999 as well as those no longer with us as of Sept. 11, 2001.

This is for Miranda, Jerry, Bryan, Tim, Jamie, Michael, Jeremy, Christopher B., Chris H., Lucas, Chad, Nathan, and all of the injured.  We'll never forget.  

Thanks, Gig 'Em, and God Bless America.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Database Migration","Hi All,

Reporting has been migrated to a new (it's own)  database server and 
access to the old server has been disabled to ensure the currency of data.

HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT YOU:
If you use tools that link to the Report Settings database, the 'pipeline' DSN on your 
PC will need to be updated to point to the new server.  Specifically this applies to 
anyone utilizing a Access database to link to the database tables.


RESOLUTION:
We will be targeting known users (Justin's Group and Jay) tomorrow.  
However if you experience problems as a result of this change please contact me.

Thanks,
Kim

"Computer Virus","
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

MATCHUP OF THE WEEK by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
New York Giants at Philadelphia, Sunday. What a difference a drive makes. Entering Week 6 this year at Giants Stadium, the Giants had won nine in a row over the Eagles. And after 55 minutes of that October game, one of the dullest in recent NFL history, New York had a 9-3 lead. Donovan McNabb could do nothing. Then he led a very un-epic 40-yard drive, found James Thrash for an 18-yard touchdown and the Eagles had broken the schneid with a 10-9 win. That one drive does not convince me the Giants still don't have the Eagles' number. These teams have changed very little -- except at receiver for Philadelphia -- since the Giants went 3-0 by a margin of 42 points over the Eagles in 2000. The key Sunday will be whether Kerry Collins can make five or six plays. The Giants need to score 14 or 17 points to win, because their secondary is susceptible to some McNabb playmaking. And, because the weather won't be a factor and the game should be determined on the merits of the players alo!
ne!
, I like Michael Strahan and Keith Hamilton to combine for three sacks, Tiki Barber to churn out, somehow, 112 total yards, and Collins to make a play or two in the fourth quarter. New York, 17-12.

POWER RANKINGS from SI's Dr. Z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) St. Louis (11-2)
A very interesting shift in philosophy occurred during the week.  Mike Martz lifted the punt receiving duties from Az-Zahir Hakim, who keeps both sides in the game.  You never know whether he'll pop one or drop one, and Martz now says he'll trade excitement for steadiness, i.e. Dre' Bly.  Could this also mean, as the playoffs loom, that he'll try to get Kurt Warner to go a little more conservative, in order to cut down on the picks (two against the Panthers, bringing his season's total to 18, highest in the NFC)?  I don't think so, but I didn't think he'd ground Hakim, either.
 
2) Pittsburgh  (12-2)
I almost made the Men of Steel my No. 1 this week after their huge win Sunday.  But hey, it was against Detroit.  OK, we all know that the true No. 1 will be determined only after Super Bowl XXXVI, and all this stuff is just window dressing, but I will be monitoring the last two contests of both the Rams and Steelers very closely to see which team really deserves the annual prize award.  What's the prize?  Well, I'll be damned if it'll be a trip to Disneyland. 

3) Chicago (11-3)
Raiders fans, you're gonna have to wait your turn, and it's going to take longer than you'd like. The Bears made a valiant comeback on a typical week-after-clinching downer, while Oakland was taking its lumps from the Titans.  Chicago earned this position.  And I hope this serves as an adequate response to all the e-mail heat I know I'm going to receive.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver sees the chinks in Tom Coughlin's armor. He knows some players hate their head coach, and that the organization has been beaten down by him. But Weaver also sees a coach who's gotten a lot out of his thinning talent over the past couple of years. That's why I see Weaver extending Coughlin's contract two or three years after this season and allowing him to preside over the tearing down and reconstruction of the franchise. That will take a solid three years.

2. The Rams are trying hard to get London Fletcher's contract done before he hits free agency. He's more valuable to St. Louis than he would be to most teams, and they can't afford to lose him if that defense hopes to continue to play so well next season.

3. I can promise you that Mike Shanahan is staying in Denver. Promise. I've never been as sure of anything in my 18 years covering this game.

4. I keep hearing Notre Dame is keeping the seat warm for Jon Gruden.

UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
The Tampa Bay Bucs finally looked like the offense that was advertised last spring when they acquired Brad Johnson. It's amazing what adversity will do and how the offense had to get away from the conservative ""just don't lose the game"" mentality when the possibility of missing the playoffs was an issue. Offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen got a chance to open it up and the end result was 42 offensive points against a tough Saints team.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSI.com's James Quintong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
Trung Canidate could be worth a start as a second or third running back in the last couple of games if the Rams build up big early leads in their last two games, which is entirely possible with home games against the Colts and Falcons. Marshall Faulk should still put up big numbers but could be rested if games get out of hand early, giving Canidate plenty of chances to shine.

Jerome Bettis may actually see some playing time this week but don't look for him to make much of a fantasy impact. The Steelers pretty much have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs already locked up and there's no real reason for Bettis to see a lot of action. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala continues to be a solid start, especially with fellow backup Amos Zereoue dealing with an injured shoulder.

"Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan","


A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

"re: Quick note","Jay,

Just a quick note to let you know that Mom and Dad arrived around 10am on
Sunday morning.  I took the day off yesterday and we did a few things around
the house and a little shopping.  Uncle Bob arrived around 11:00am from
Phoenix and we went to lunch.  He was back on the road for Houston around
1:00pm.  There is a new subdivision going up down the street from us so we
walked down there yesterday afternoon and wandered through some of the
houses.  Dad seemed to enjoy it -- walking off the sq footage, inspecting
the construction, etc.

WR and I have been really watching the situation with Enron and have our
fingers crossed that things will work out for you now that the deal with
Dynergy has been announced.  Uncle Bob seemed to think that Paul is in a
pretty precarious situation with his job.

Take care and tell the girls 'Aunt Lyn says hi.'

Lyn

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban

Subject: Hello and an Update


Hey Everyone,
I wanted to take this opportunity to check in and say
'hello'. I apologize for the mass email but in my
overall business and general flakedome I have been
totally out of touch with just about everyone I know.
Steve and I have had a lot of changes in the past
months and I'll briefly fill you in on the highlights.


Foremost, in spite of our good intentions and efforts,
Steve and I did not relocate to the San Diego area.
Instead, I have taken a job at Stanford University. On
September 10, I took on the position of Manager of
Stanford Visitor Information Services. In this job I
manage about 70 students and a full time assistant
manager. We conduct campus tours for prospective
students, the public, and paying private groups. I
work extensively with the office of Admissions and the
President's Office as we try to put 'the best face' on
the University. It's been interesting and slightly
complicated. On my second day of work we had a major
bomb threat at Hoover Tower and I've already filed one
police report of suspected terrorist activity. On the
whole, while it's been extremely busy as I've hired
and trained new staff, I am loving my work. It's kind
of like I never left, and I now know more about
Stanford history and interworkings than I ever thought
possible.

Steve and I rented a house in Mountain View, about 20
miles south of where we used to live. We have
neighbors, and Napoleon and Halle are enjoying having
twice as much square footage to occupy. Napoleon is
doing well. He's 7 and 1/2 months old and has a really
gentle and fun personality. His best party trick is
that he howls along with us when we sing. Halle is
also doing well - though she sometimes tires of being
chased by Napoleon.

The house has a back yard, an office and a guest room.
We moved in the weekend before I started my new job so
it took a while to get settled and a couple of boxes
remain unpacked. However, we are ready to entertain
and welcome any visitors.

The little free time we have is still spent exercising
and relaxing. I'm running a lot and playing volleyball
and Steve is fighting a heel spur and bad calf. We are
both enjoying Stanford football season and the general
excitement of college football on the weekends. That
coupled with our new NFL game ticket makes for
football-intensive weekends.

Our families are doing well. Steve's brother was
waived by the Jets at the end of August and now plays
for the Cleveland Browns. Steve's parents are teaching
at a Native American reservation in central Nebraska.
Andrea's sister and niece are still in Austin and the
rest of the immediate family still reside in San
Diego. 

Not much else to report. I am including all of our new
address information for your records. Again, I
apologize for not contacting each of you personally.
As we get into a regular routine I expect to do a
better job with correspondence and general balance.

Love,
Andrea

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Report Performance","We received performance figures from our DBA for the new server.

The numbers indicate processes on the server were outstripping physical
RAM memory -- which can cause the server to slow down.  In answer to 
this, server memory settings were tuned producing a minor but immediate 
improvement in processing times.

We next need to reboot the server to allow the memory configuration changes 
to take full effect and will be working on coordinating this with the other usres
on the server today.

Thanks,
Kim

"IMPORTANT!  Actions this evening.","In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances that we should address, please reply to this e-mail and we will change our schedule accordingly.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

"Electronic Pay Stubs","Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Subject: Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity


Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

Based on your concerns and requests for additional notice prior to
commissioning each additional segment, we are adopting the following
procedure for placing segments in service:

We will notify you when we have filed each segment with FERC for approval.
Based on our experience with the tie-ins to date, we are now anticipating 4
days for approval.  Upon receiving FERC approval, we will notify you of the
contract in service date for that segment of capacity. The contract will
start at the later of the following dates:  1) two days following the date
of FERC approval; 2) 4 days following filing with FERC; or 3) at least one
week following the last in service date.

For example, we officially filed for the second segment approval (61
Mdth/day) September 25 (today) and anticipate filing the next segment (79
Mdth/day) on October 1.  If we receive FERC approval tomorrow, we will
notify you, but the contract will not become effective until Sept 29.
However, you would have additional capacity available a couple days early at
$.1434.

Hopefully, the above procedure will help you to plan for your nominations by
providing more flexability and notice for each additional commissioning.
Please call me to discuss or with any questions.

Laine Lobban

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

That seems the best day to take them to lunch and get back by dark. We are also feeding the neighbors dogs  etc. while they are gone so we need to get back. Hope Lauren is feeling better and everyone else is OK. Got my fingers crossed that the weather holds thru the first of the year and that no one is sick. Love, Mom

Attached is the final reconciliation for Citizens.  This reconciliation is to repay Citizens for volumes we already recouped from LGS Natural Gas Company.  We have included in this calculation the premium, transport costs, fuel and the capacity release credit of $.06 which amounts $241,204.73 due Citizens. 

Citizens would like to receive payment as soon as possible.

In future invoices, we will also see an adjustment for LGS (now Woodward Marketing) volumes to prevent these overpayments from happening.

Please let me know when Citizens can expect payment and call me if you have any questions.

"Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity","Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.

"hello","All,

As many of you already know, I decided to take a position at EES, so this week suppose to be my last week in the Gas Fundamentals Group.
It is a pretty satisfactory feeling to the reporting team and myself that we are able to contribute to the success of gas trading by providing over
100 reports every day. I certainly appreciated all your help, cooperation and friendship. Needless to say it was a great experience to work with 
you all. 

At Dave Dronet's request I'll stay one more week to transit my responsibilities to Kim Alexsander next week. Kim will lead the reporting team
and continue provide the excellent support to you all. The reporting team is in good hands. Even after I move to another group,
I am just a phone call away, I'll let you know my new phone # and continue to help you wherever I can. 

Thanks....

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

"west summary","Jay, 

Changes have been made in the westsummary code, so that it can take parameters (report id)
I have created two report id's 1- north (all the existing group), 2 - south (nothing now, you need add)
You can run as before: O:\Fundy_Ops\IT\Report\West Summary\EXE\JayWS.exe 1.

One thing to notice is that if you want to split the existing report to two, besides change the report id
on the group table, ,make sure you do the it right on the FORMULA  table, I mean, don't reference points
on the other report.

Let me know if you have questions.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

I think you should call Second to find out if they counsel or get
someone
off of their list.

"Solar Migration - Second Notice","
	During the weekend of October 6 and 7, 2001 the Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating all production users off the current hardware (Solar) that houses their home and application directories (no production databases are effected) to new hardware.	

	This migration requires a total system outage of approximately 4 hours.  The outage will occur Friday night - Saturday morning between the hours of Midnight to 4:00 AM.  All users will need to be logged off during this time period.  If this is not possible, contact Adam DeRidder (x3-1428) or Carlos Uribe (x5-8179) as soon as possible.
	In order to validate the migration, production users need to test access to their home directories and applications on Saturday, October 7 and Sunday, October 8, 2001.

	As part of the migration plan, the Storage Team needs volunteers from the production community to test the new environment.  The test will only require approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.  Adam DeRidder and Carlos Uribe have setup a test lab on the 34th floor for this purpose.  Contact Adam to setup a time.  Your involvement will help make this a successful migration.

	A list of contacts will be made available on Thursday, October 5, 2001.  Please use this list to report issues and check the status of the migration.

ATTENTION ALL SHIPPERS/NOMINATING AGENTS AND PLANT OPERATORS: 


Due to the continuing warm weather and other operational considerations, Public Service Company (PSCo) cannot accept either:

Imbalance payback gas from Shippers/Nominating Agents, or 
More gas than what is currently confirmed from each plant into PSCo's system. 



Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY for gas days November 3 - 4; if over-deliveries become a problem during this period, PSCo may activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback to PSCo for gas days November 3 - 4.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

This was sent to me and I thought you might be interested in voting
yourself.
Evelyn

Dear voter,

The host of ABC's ""Politically Incorrect,"" Bill Maher, is under fire for

calling recent U.S. military actions in the Middle East ""cowardly.""  On
Wednesday, White House Press Secretary called Maher's comments ""a
terrible
thing to say"" and said, ""This is not a time for remarks like that; there

never is.""

While Maher says his criticisms were directed at politicians - not our
servicemen and women - many have called for the show to be cancelled.

Log on to  http://www.vote.com  to tell ABC whether or not ""Politically
Incorrect"" should be taken off the air. When you vote, your opinion will
be
automatically sent to the network.

Be sure to forward this message to friends and family so they can vote
too!

Thank you.

He figured he would be laid off so he got a job interview with Dynergy before things fell apart. Apparently he was given the option to stay but decided he was a sure bet for the Dynergy job and turned down the offer. When he went to Dynergy they told him they couldn't hire Enron employees because of the law suit so he is now jobless. Bob thinks it was a stupid decision but Tom apparently thinks it was the thing to do. Guess only time will tell. Love, Mom

"BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser","
Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

"Rockies Term Markets","Jay:

In my travels looking for index 2 ways in the various rockies term markets you need I am running into several issues.  First off, as you are aware, these markets don't tend to change much from day to day especially for the more obscure points and longer dated periods.  

Secondly, the time of year being the holidays is keeping most traders focused on Jan, Jan-Mar and April-Oct02 for the most part.  Getting traders to show numbers beyond that, much less getting them to do it every day is not productive or practical.

I suggest we keep in touch as we always do on a daily basis and I will pass on whatever we pick up in the market.  However, attempting to refresh 2-5 year index markets on a daily basis isn't going to yield much in the way of ""new"" news.

I look forward to seeing your shop get back on its feet down the road and to working with you.

Thanks,    Jim Kornmann - DataLine Energy

Promises 
by Dr. Bill Bright 
September 26, 2001
His Word Remains Forever 
Scripture: Matthew 24:36-42
<http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Matth
ew+24:36-42> 
35 ""Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words remain forever"" 
42 ""Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will
come.""

Commentary: In a day of change and turmoil, the promise is made that the
word of God will stand forever. The significance of that guarantee is
monumental, incredible. It is not just that a book shall remain in print;
rather, it is that the multitudinous truths contained in that book likewise
will remain in effect steadfast and true. 
Long after heaven and earth have passed away God's holy Word will continue
to endure. 
That should mean much to you and me in our daily walk. God's promise, ""All
things work together for good,"" to the believer is just as true today as it
was when it was written centuries ago. 
In fact, every one of the promises in the Word of God - including the 365
referred to in this daily devotional - is bona fide, guaranteed by the God
of the universe, the Creator of all things. That alone should strengthen our
faith to know that we can trust him supremely with our lives and everything
concerned with them. 
When all else fails, when hope is almost gone, we can come back to the Word
of God, which is ""quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword."" It
will have the answer for every problem, every burden, every need we face.
Prayer: The hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will
worship the Father in spirit and truth. O God, the author of peace, to know
You is eternal life and to serve You is perfect freedom: Defend us, Your
humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that we, trusting in Your
defense, may not fear the power of any adversaries; through the might of
Jesus Christ our Lord. We celebrate our creation, preservation, and all the
blessings of this life; but above all for Your immeasurable love in the
redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace,
and for the hope of glory. And, we pray, give us such an awareness of Your
mercies, that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth Your praise, not
only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our selves to Your
service, and by walking before You in holiness and righteousness all our
days; through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom, with You and the Holy Spirit,
be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen. 

TODAY'S ACTION POINT: I will place my complete confidence in God's
unchanging Word and will rest upon His faithful promises to all believers
for supernatural living. 
Praise Report and Prayer Requests:
I want to express my gratitude to everyone for their prayers for Jack. He
did have his surgery last Tuesday. He made it through but is still in
intensive care and it was confirmed that the cancer has spread to his liver.
His chemo will be postponed till he is well enough to get into a room then
to his home. His recovery is slow but he did come off the ventilator Sunday
and actually took a drink of Sprite today--huge progress, praise God. I'd
like to put Wayne Owens on the prayer list also. As you know Wayne had renal
cancer about 5 or 6 years ago. He has been having muscular pain in his legs
and throughout his body--the pain was so severe he had to stop all athletic
activity. The doctors do not think it is cancer. Thank you sweet John. I
will keep you updated on both of these wonderful people. Brenda 

Hi John: An update on Dave... is back in intensive care after brain
surgery.. leak of brain fluid, had to be drained and now has
infection...must clear up infection, then they will put in a shunt to keep
fluid off the brain...we ask the Lord to continue to bless Dave with courage
to endure the pain and headaches and faith that that he will be allowed to
complete his mission here on earth.... The Lord never said this journey on
earth would be easy: he just said it would be worth it. 

I want to share a cute story that a friend passed on to me. He teaches
seminary each day to our youth.. A Sunday school teacher asked each student
if they knew another word for happiness. The word he was looking for was
Joy. Then he told the students to take each letter.. J is for Jesus, O is
for others, and Y is for yourself. The secret for having happiness in your
life is to put Jesus first, others next, and yourself last. Thought you
might want to pass this on to all our friends. Have a great day! Love, MJ 

Good Morning, Please keep my father, Gordon Martin, in your prayers today.
Yesterday was his 81st birthday, and to celebrate...he broke his hip! He was
sitting in his chair and tried to ""get up"" and hurt his hip area. He was
able to walk around yesterday and last night with a cane, but during the
night his right leg stiffened and was unable to move it this morning. His
doctor (Warren Longmire, who still makes house calls) came by this morning
and was almost 100% sure he had broken his hip. Dad is now at Clear Lake
Area Hospital with my Mom and a couple of my sisters. -bert-

Prayer Of Healing (by Max Lucado Sent In By Joe Collins)
This prayer was prayed by Max Lucado on Moody radio. He had prayed it in
his church worship service on Sunday.

Dear Lord, We're still hoping we'll wake up. We're still hoping we'll open
a sleepy eye and think, ""What a horrible dream."" But we won't, will we,
Father? What we saw was not a dream. Planes did gouge towers. Flames did
consume our fortress. People did perish. It was no dream and, dear Father,
we are sad.

There is a ballet dancer who will no longer dance and a doctor who will no
longer heal. A church has lost her priest, a classroom is minus a teacher.
Cora ran a food pantry. Paige was a counselor and Dana, dearest Father,
Dana was only three years old. (Who held her in those final moments?) We
are sad, Father. For as the innocent are buried, our innocence is buried as
well. We thought we were safe. Perhaps we should have known better. But we
didn't.

And so we come to you. We don't ask you for help; we beg you for it. We
don't request it; we implore it. We know what you can do. We've read the
accounts. We've pondered the stories and now we plead, ""Do it again, Lord.
Do it again.""

Remember Joseph? You rescued him from the pit. You can do the same for us.
Do it again, Lord.
Remember the Hebrews in Egypt? You protected their children from the angel
of death. We have children, too, Lord. Do it again.
And Sarah? Remember her prayers? You heard them. Joshua? Remember his
fears? You inspired him. The women at the tomb? You resurrected their hope.
The doubts of Thomas? You took them away. Do it again, Lord. Do it again.
You changed Daniel from a captive into a king's counselor. You took Peter
the fisherman and made him Peter an apostle. Because of you, David went
from leading sheep to leading armies. Do it again, Lord, for we need
counselors today, Lord. We need apostles. We need leaders. Do it again,
dear Lord.

Most of all, do again what you did at Calvary. What we saw here last
Tuesday, you saw there that Friday. Innocence slaughtered. Goodness
murdered. Mothers weeping. Evil dancing. Just as the smoke eclipsed our
morning, so the darkness fell on your Son. Just as our towers were
shattered, the very Tower of Eternity was pierced. And by dusk, heaven's
sweetest song was silent, buried behind a rock. But you did not waver, O
Lord. You did not waver. After three days in a dark hole, you rolled the
rock and rumbled the earth and turned the darkest Friday into the brightest
Sunday. Do it again, Lord. Grant us a September Easter.

We thank you, dear Father, for these hours of unity. Christians are praying
with Jews. Republicans are standing with Democrats. Skin colors have been
covered by the ash of burning buildings. We thank you for these hours of
unity. And we thank you for these hours of prayer. The Enemy sought to
bring us to our knees and succeeded. He had no idea, however, that we would
kneel before you. And he has no idea what you can do.

Let your mercy be upon our President, Vice President, and their families.
Grant to those who lead us wisdom beyond their years and experience. Have
mercy upon the souls who have departed and the wounded who remain. Give us
grace that we might forgive and faith that we might believe. And look
kindly upon your church. For two thousand years you've used her to heal a
hurting world. Do it again, Lord. Do it again.
Through Christ,
Amen.

Mom asked that I send you the following questions:

Does Reagan have (or would like) any of the following:

	Jr. Monopoly
	Jr. Clue
	Cinderella's Doll House (Computer Game)
	A 'Dr.' Barbie doll

The mall is really close by so Mom and Dad are spending time shopping for

You can get them whatever you want, but think back to when we were kids
and how much you hated ""big kid"" gifts.  Meg does that enough.  In my
opinion they are kids and the one thing they really want are toys and
games...fun things.  It is no fun going to Grandma's house for Christmas
and get nothing but clothes.  You want to get some toys to play with and
have fun with.  That is just my opinion, but you should get what you
want for them.

Jay,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I know that you are really busy and may
not
have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the
girls?
Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will
be
pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send
them
back with Mom and Dad.  If clothing is a good option -- what sizes?
Also,
does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry
box
or anything like that.  I thought about buying something that could be
for a
'big girl' instead of toys.  However, I am open to any and all ideas --
I
want to get them something they will enjoy.  If you don't have time to
respond, please forward this to Jennifer.

As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little
better.  I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my
breakfast since a week ago Monday.  I hope that this means I have turned
some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other
morning and fighting intense nausea every day.  Also, in the last week I
have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre.

Take care,
Lyn

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Analyst & Associate Program Update","
I want to provide you with an update on current events and their potential effects on members of the Program.

As the business units make decisions about the future course of the company, members of the Program will be affected.  Where positions are eliminated, individuals are being given consideration for other opportunities available within Enron.  Any information communicated to you regarding elimination of your position by the business units will have been coordinated with the Program in advance, and will be definitive.

I know how anxious and frustrating these times are for everyone - they are for my team as well.  The most accurate and timely internal source of information will be communication from the Enron Corp Office of the Chairman.

At this point, no one is certain what the future may bring regarding our careers at Enron.  I do know for certain that each of you is here, because you were selected from ""the very best of the best"".  I appreciate your continuing patience and efforts.

If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (35275), Terry Bosien (35230) or me (36671).

Subject:	Wyoming Interstate Gas Company (WIC) Maintenance

On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput during the work will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMCf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMcf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocations methods.

"Work Hours","Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

We are still planning on coming on the 12th and will go spend the day with them on the 13th. Meg bought a new car Saturday ( silver-blue VW Pissat ). Guess who will be buying her old car? Dad wants a smaller car to run to the store etc. so he couldn't turn it down. He still makes remarks about having to give up the Acclaim so I hope this pacifies him. Hope everything is OK down there. The weather has been Picture-Perfect here. Lyn is now telling people about the pregnancy but we haven't told anyone in Hitchcock yet . Thought we would do that when we go unless she tells them first.

"FW: Western Frontier Project","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Cantrell, Rebecca W.  
Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 1:28 PM
To:	Miller, Stephanie; Tholt, Jane M.; Shively, Hunter S.; Lucci, Paul T.
Subject:	Western Frontier Project

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

"Associate / Analyst Program","
After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

Hi:
Hope you are all doing well. I liked the pictures you sent Mom of the girls
at the zoo. She is amazed by the digital camera technology.

I found some nice sleeping bags for Reagan and Madison at JC Penney. They
have animals on them and the pillows are the animal on the bag. They have a
dog, bear, dolphin, frog and monkey. Which animals do you think each girl
would like? I'll also get each of them some ""Little House"" books. What does
Lauren need? What do the two of you want? Do you want a gift certificate for
a restaurant so you can go have a nice evening together or something for the
new house?

Mom is apparently telling both of us the same thing for Dad. Are you
planning to get the clippers or shall we? I know he also wants some chairs
for the patio. Let me know what you decide, and I'll get the other.

It's 284 days until my partner starts, not that I'm counting. I'm firing one
of my nurses--actually we're transferring her to another department because
she hasn't screwed up enough to fire but she is just not giving me the help
I need to run a busy practice. My front office staff is finally catching on
to things. So overall I think I'm calmer. We're going to Fredericksburg next
week for a 3 day weekend.

Take care,
Meg

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Wed Gas Fundies Meeting","Keith and I discussed working towards this meeting being organized every week.  We would like the meeting to begin at 3:00 and to have all interested parties (Canada and Portland) dialed in to AT&T.  I would like the meeting room cleared and the handouts to be emailed before the meeting begins.  Please work towards emailing everyone an itinerary each week.

Aaron,



Since late last week PG&E web site started to posted with non data for some of the points.  Our solution currently is refering to previous day's data on the same point and using same values for days overlap and giving same value for new day.  Example:  on 11/01/01's captured file on California Production Injection poin twe have --


			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172


and on 11/02/01's captured file on California Production Injection point we have --

			11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01	11/08/01
California Pro Injection	     


when this happens, out transform code will fail and also potentially cause future loading jobs to fail because some future data is based on past data so we have to manually edited the file as follwing --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172





Until web site data is back to normal or we find better solution, this will be the solution we implement for now.  Please let me or Chris Hyde know if you have any questions.  Thanks.






	
Eddie

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Yan, 

Where can I find the link to the interactive CUBE.

The reason I ask is Adam has two reports (Southern Natural and Algonquin & Maritimes NE) 
where the MTD AVG for October is skewed upwards.  
Higher than it should be for the values reported for Oct 1, 2, 3...like it's including numbers not shown.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Subject: George W.


This was sent to me.  I don't know who wrote it but it is good!

Subject: George W.


 This was the same man who came within a hair's breadth of losing an
election in
November, who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida Democratic
machine to fix the vote count.
 This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in younger
years, and whose happy-go-lucky lifestyle led him to mediocre grades in
college
and an ill-fated oil venture.
 This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father, and
whose
speaking missteps became known as ""Bushisms."" And on Friday, this was the
man
who bore the weight of the world and the responsibilities of a generation
with
dignity, class, confidence, appropriate solemnity,
 and even much-needed wit.
 One thing struck me during the campaign, that difficult,
 roller-coaster campaign that now seems years ago. It was that George W.
Bush
never seemed to get ruffled. Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or
the
sudden (some would say, vicious) release of a DUI arrest two decades ago at
 a key moment, ""W"" did not lose his cool. At times, his staff seemed
overconfident, as did many of us. A 350-electoral-vote win, they quietly
implied
and we optimistically believed. Then they counted the votes, miscounted
others,
and re-counted still others. At the end, he was still there.
 Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed and puffed, trying to gin up
something out of nothing, Bush quietly but confidently waited at his ranch.
He
did nothing:  that is the mistake people have constantly made with this man,
confusing lack of bluster for absence of action. No, his team of attorneys
and
the iron-willed James Baker were carrying out his orders, but W
 stayed in the background, confident and faithful.
 You see, it is this faith business that confounded everyone. We  have had
such
actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically whenever
anyone used the term faith.
 But this was the same man who was the first politician ever in
 recent memory to name Jesus Christ as the lord of his life on public TV.
 Not an oblique reference to being ""born-again"" or having a ""life change.""
 He said the un-PC-like phrase, ""Jesus Christ,"" to which his handlers and
advisors, no doubt, off stage, were also saying, ""Jesus Christ"" in a much
different tone.
 God has a way of honoring those who honor him. David learned  that while he
was
on the run from Saul's armies. Job learned that after his time of horrible
tribulation. The Messiah said so Himself, many times. So this was the man
who
actually put faith into practice. He actually loves those who hate him. It
is a
staggering concept, so foreign in daily occurrence
 that few thought it anything but grandstanding. Even one of W's biggest
supporters chided the president for adhering to his ""new tone.""
 Yet there he was, again and again, thanking the Democrats.
 Appointing his enemies to high places in his government. Inviting his
former
foes and their wives to private movie screenings, and (I know, this is  hard
to
stomach) even treating them with dignity. See, this was the man who
 learned early on how faith worked: by praying for his enemies, you ""heap
burning coals upon their heads."" Happen to catch

Bill Clinton at the National Prayer Service?  Didn't look too good, did he?

 This was the man who named the absolute top people in national  security
and
defense, then caught barbs from the politically righteous  that this one
didn't
have the right views on abortion or that one didn't  have the right position
on
guns.
 And on September 11, at midmorning, this was the man thrust into a position
only known by Roosevelt, Churchill, Lincoln, and
 Washington. The weight of the world was on his shoulders, and the
responsibility of a generation was on his soul.
 So this same man---the one that the media repeatedly attempted to tarnish
with
charges of ""illegitimacy,"" and the one whose political opponents desperately
sought to stonewall until mid-term elections--- walked to his seat at the
front
of the National Cathedral just three days after the two most impressive
symbols
of American capitalism and
 prosperity virtually evaporated, along with, perhaps, thousands of
Americans.
 As he sat down next to his wife, immediately I knew that even if  his faith
ever faltered, hers didn't. I have never seen a more
 peaceful  face than Laura Bush, whose eyes seemed as though they were
already
gazing at the final outcome . . . not just of this conflict, but of  her
reward
in
 Heaven itself. In this marriage, you indeed got two for the price of  one.
 The appropriate songs were sung, as one said, to in an almost
 unbearably emotional service. I, for one, broke down innumerable  times
merely  listening on tape delay on the radio. How the man spoke without
blubbering,
I'll never know.
 Then came the defining moment of our generation. Some people  fondly recall
their Woodstock days. Others mark with grim sadness  November 22, 1963, as
the
day America lost her innocence. But I firmly believe when the history of
this
time is written, it will be acknowledged by  friend  and foe alike that
President George W. Bush came of age in that  cathedral
 and lifted a nation off its knees. It wasn't so much his words,
 though read a  decade later, they will indeed be as stirring as any. The
conflict  would  end, he noted, ""at a time of our choosing."" It certainly
wasn't
his emotion.
 What had to have been one of the most stunning exhibitions of  self-control
in
presidential history, W was able to deliver his
 remarks without  losing either his resolve or his focus, or, more
important,
his  confidence.
 It was as if God's hand, which had guided him through that
 sliver-thin  election, now rested fully on him. His quiet confidence let
our
enemies know . . . and believe me, they know . . . that they made a grave
miscalculation.
  Now, this same man who practiced his faith through a tough
 election, who steeled his convictions even more in a drawn-out  Florida
battle,
and  who never once gave in to the temptation to get in the gutter with  his
foes (well, OK, maybe the ""Clymer"" comment is an exception), this  same
 man now lifted the weight of the world and the responsibility of a
generation
and put it on his modest shoulders as though it were  another unpleasant
duty.
 As he walked back to his seat, the camera angle was appropriate.
 He was virtually alone in the scene, alone in that massive place of  God,
just
him and the Lord. But that's the way it's always been in his  life
recently. In
that brief time it took him to return to his seat, I  believe he  heard
words to
the effect of, ""You can do this, George. I am with  you always.
 And you can do this well, because I am going before you. And don't  worry
about the weight. I've got it."" And I saw in his eyes a quiet
acknowledgment.
 ""I know.  Thank you, Lord.""
  Back at his seat, when W sat down, George H. W. Bush reached  over and
took
his son's hand. The elder Bush always struck me as a  religious  man, but
not
someone who shared his life on a daily basis with the  Lord.
 George H. W.  treats the Father like a respected uncle, visiting him  on
appropriate holidays and knowing the relationship is real, but not
constant.
 Anyway, I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H. W. said,  ""I wish
I
could do this for you, son, but I can't. You have to do this on your  own.""
W
squeezed  back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept
throughout.
 It said, ""I don't have to do it alone, dad. I've got help.""

MATCHUP OF THE WEEK by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
I love the Green Bay-Chicago rivalry. I'll never forget the time, back in 1990, covering Bears-Packers at Lambeau, when I followed the Chicago team buses from Appleton, about 30 minutes away, to the stadium on Sunday morning. As the convoy passed a farm, two kids began beating a large stuffed bear, hung in effigy from a tree, in full view of the buses. How about that? The kids knew they were the Bears' buses. They knew about when they'd be passing. And they put on a great show. Somehow I think the intensity might be as good this weekend at Soldier Field. The Bears will send the house (in the form of Rosevelt Colvin, Brian Urlacher, Philip Daniels and Bryan Robinson) at Brett Favre for four quarters. Ahman Green will have to rise to the occasion and take some pressure off Favre by running the ball effectively. Chicago had allowed but two sacks all season until last week when Courtney Brown got three for the Browns, and I look for the Pack, aiming for the NFL sack record with !
ru!
shers who have come from nowhere, to make life hard for the Chicago passing game. Key to the game? Simple. Ball-possession by the Pack. If Favre and Green can lead four or five long, clock-eating drives, the Bears won't be able to make the magic they've made the past two weeks.

POWER RANKINGS from SI's Dr. Z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Oakland Raiders (6-1)
Their offense looked like a military drill team Monday night.  Defensively, well, I still can't figure out why all-pro cornerback Charles Woodson, who left the field with a turf toe, made cameo appearances thereafter but not when the Broncos drove deep. I mean he's either hurt or he's not hurt, or maybe there were times when the painkiller wore off and he was waiting for the new shot to kick in. Odd, eh?

2) St. Louis Rams (6-1)
Their bye, coupled with the Steelers' loss, occasioned this position switch. Memo to potential Mailbaggers: Any moaning about this will produce exactly the same comment as you just read, unless you threaten me personally, and then I'll attack your grammatical structure.

3) Pittsburgh Steelers (5-2)
The offensive line held firm, and the Ravens rushers hardly got a sniff of Kordell, which was why, I believe, he put up good numbers.  I was particularly impressed with the job that former taxi squadder Oliver Ross, subbing for injured Wayne Gandy at LT, did against Michael McCrary.  With help, of course. Always with help.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Just curious if Jets safety Damian Robinson would have gotten a game's suspension instead of just a fine if he'd done what it looked like he was trying to do the other night, which was attempting to break Aaron Brooks' neck. Weak penalty, NFL. Very weak.

2. The Redskins love Fresno State quarterback David Carr. The Redskins do not love Tony Banks, who hasn't fully learned Washington's offensive playbook. It'll be interesting to see -- if the Redskins keep winning -- how much they'll trade to move up to get a quarterback near the top of the first round of the draft.

3. The Ravens wish Elvis Grbac were tougher.

4. Mike Holmgren has a real decision on his hands. To show his team he's trying to do everything he can to win now, Trent Dilfer has to be his quarterback Sunday against Oakland, not the erratic Matt Hasselbeck, even though I'm a proponent of Hasselbeck getting experience now.

UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
I'm not surprised that rookie free agent running back Dominic Rhodes has filled in for Edgerrin James in an exceptional way. Last week in a win over Buffalo, Rhodes rushed for 100 yards and caught four passes for 45 yards. I spent a considerable amount of time with Rhodes last winter and I was amazed that so many NFL teams really didn't know about this kid. Rhodes was a high school legend in Texas before he enrolled at Midwestern Texas State. If he had gone to Texas or A&M he might have been a second-round pick. It's a tribute to Bill Polian, who uncovered the back and got him without using a draft pick. Believe me, Rhodes won't be a backup his whole career, either.

FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSI.com's James Quintong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
While the Jets defense can be prone to giving up lots of yards, they are definitely among the top fantasy defenses by the sheer number of turnovers they've forced. The Jets defense has picked off 11 passes and forced 13 fumbles this year, both great fantasy numbers. It's something to look out for if you've got a turnover-prone player taking on the Jets in upcoming weeks.

After sitting out the past couple of weeks with a knee injury, Marshall Faulk is healthy and ready to go for the Rams. Go ahead and activate him as he has a favorable matchup at home against a Carolina team that's ranked next to last in total defense.

Hi Jay,
 
I'm running a test on the first page.
 
You should have received an E-mail. I filled out the first form and submitted it, just like someone registering would do. The system should have sent you an E-mail in the background.
 
In addition, you can check accumulative results at this Web Page:
<http://www.berean-houston.org//Judge_House/form_results.txt>
 
To test the page youself, go to the Judgement House link on our Web Site. Click on the link, and go to the page on Judgement House. Scroll to the very bottom of the page. You will see an asterix below the last line ""It does make a difference..."" Click on the asterix - that will take you to the test page.
 
Let me know what you think, and if you would like to see any changes.
 
Once we agree on that page, I'll build the second page for groups and we'll test it. Once that's done, then we'll create the links on the Judgement House Page.
 
In Him,
Bruno <><

Hi Bruno,
 
I looked at the web-site and it looks great.  We probably just need to add the following sentence to the end of your text block after the phone number.  It should contain hyperlinks to 2 separate forms.  Both forms can be e-mailed to this address... jennsreit@houston.rr.com <mailto:jennsreit@houston.rr.com>
 
 
""Or please fill out the on-line registration form for groups of 10 or more or individual families.""
 
 
The form can be in any format easy for you to design and should include the following information for groups:
 
Group Name
Contact Name
Number in Group
Desired Presentation Date
Desired Presentation Time
Contact Phone Number
*Contact Address
*Contact E-mail Address
*Additional Comments
 
*optional 
 
 
and for individual families:
 
Name

Number in Group
Desired Presentation Date
Desired Presentation Time
Phone Number
*Address
*E-mail Address
*Additional Comments
 
*optional
 
 
If you think that 1 form is enough and easier for you to create then we can use the one for groups.  I just want to make it as simple as possible for people to register and to not make it look like we are only accepting groups.  Use your judgement on that one, it does not really matter to me.
 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thank you for your help.
 
Always for Him
 
Jay

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Hello Torrey,
	I examined past CIG deals and made code changes to allow default meter 991764500 when Enron sells physical gas.  Assuming deals continue to be sent as before, I have results of sample deals production which I tested with; see below.  Please test the changes at your earliest convenient.  Thanks.

Hi Dat,

As per Jay's request, is it possible to set the SITARA bridge to attach the following two default meter numbers to CIG Mainline deals, depending on whether they are buys or sales (from Enron's perspective)?

Essentially, any deal in which Enron is the seller and the location is at Pipe ""CIG"" and trade zone ""CENTRAL"" should have a default meter number of 991764500, while any deal in which Enron is the buyer at the same location should go to meter number UNA-516938.

Since the EOL mapping tables can only support one meter number per location, it would be necessary to set this logic up in the SITARA bridge itself. Is this doable from your end?

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Lisa Finley just called me to let me know that Devon Operators need to take Beaver Creek down tomorrow for 8 hours.  They apologize for the short notice, but said if they don't fix the cooler now it will bring the whole system down soon.  

We will be short by about 6,500 on the 005 contract for Gas Day 4 and I guess we'll have to work at paying it back.


That's all I have to say .....about that.

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"Socal Window Meeting","Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

"P&L estimates","Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

Saturday Weather Forecast for New Orleans:

Saturday morning:  70% chance of showers and thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain possible.

Saturday noon: 60-70% chance of thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain likely.

Saturday late afternoon:  Rain chances decreasing, 30% chance of lingering showers.  

Saturday evening and night:  Clearing skies.

That is the best I can come up with right now.  Front is moving through on Saturday and it is all based on timing.  If the front slows down or speeds up, then of course it will greatly change the forecast.  My guess is that the front will come through faster than indicated and possibly by mid to late afternoon, rain chances will be nil, but at this point that is kind of risky.

Hope this helps.

"FW: Intercepted Memo From Osama Bin Laden","Intercepted Memo From Osama Bin Laden 
Here is a memo we have Intercepted from Osama Bin Laden to all of his
Cavemates. 


To: Cavemates

From: Bin Laden, Osama 

Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:17 AM 

Subject: The Cave 

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've
finally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for
putting up the poster that says ""There is no I in team"" as well as the one
that says ""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while we
are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly
I have a few concerns. 
First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we
should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you
don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.

I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening. 
Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're
taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while
we're taping. Thanks. 
Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,
especially after mealtime. We're all in this together. 
Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote ""Osama"" on
the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone.
Consideration. That's all I'm saying. 
Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying
to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First
patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard. 

Love you lots. 

Osama B.

The Cube is being processed now. I'll alert Adam and Justin when 
it's completed.

At this moment the exact cause is unknown. However the error 
appears to have been an authenication error of the cube getting to 
the FDYPIPELINEPROD database.  

Changing the authenication from that provided by CORP domain to
the database admin account and password solved the problem.

I'll notify you all of the solution as soon as we determine what caused
the failure.  In the meantime any reports rerun after the cube finishes procesing
should have the most recent data.

  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported 
  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement 
  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange 
  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather 
  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International 
  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will 
  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit 
  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. </font></p>

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

started out ok, but I feel like I am about to loose it again.  Please call
me on my cell phone if you have time to talk.  I guess I just need some

"Confirmation Process","We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.  All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.  Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.  All broker deals will be handled this way.

Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.  This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.

Anne, please communicate this to your group.

Thanks,
Mike

"FW: Wishing you well","
As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

"Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity","Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 6th segment to gate valve 5 providing a
total firm capacity of 519 Mdth/day was approved by FERC yesterday and is
available for transport.  The contract effective date for this additional
capacity will be on Monday, November 5.  We plan on filing the request for
the final segment of additional contacted capacity to gate valve 4 today or
Monday.

Based on conversations with many of you, it appears the 192 Mdth/day of
additional (572 Mdth/day total) capacity on Medicine Bow provided by this
last segment commissioning will be sufficient to accomodate your
transportation requirements until the entire project goes into service
(anticipated late this month).  For the month of October, the capacity
contracted was approximatly 90% utilized, and we anticipate even greater
utilization for November.  While a few of you have mentioned possibly having
production in excess of your contract, it appears that the remaining
shippers will have underutilized capacity and no additional capacity will be
necessary until the Loop goes in service.    

Following the last segment approval notice, I will continue to update you on
the progress and timing for the entire Loop in-service for your information
and planning. 

Please call me if you have any questions.

"RE: Spark Spread Options","



Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning we received FERC approval for the fourth tie-in segment (to
gate #7) contracted  for  92 Mdth/day.  This brings the firm capacity of the
Medicine Bow system to 472 Mdth/day.  The contract effective date will be
October 19, but you will be able to utilize this capacity as soon as we have
it set up in the system today.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.
