MATCHUP OF THE WEEK by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
I saw Jim Fassel the morning after the Monday night disaster and he was blunt about what margin for error his Giants team has after digging itself a five-loss hole with a stinker at Minnesota. ""None,"" he said. ""We just have to eliminate the little mistakes that are killing us."" The Giants had their worst penalty game since 1949 against the Vikings -- 15 for 150 yards -- and put the ball on the ground four times. Plus, they abandoned the running game too soon. What has to be particularly worrisome is the play of Kerry Collins, who is an above-average quarterback when he has time to set up and throw but a below-average one when feeling pressure. He's now fumbled 10 times in the past five weeks, and he has a maddening penchant for taking bad sacks when on the edge of field-goal range. This game will be an acid test for Oakland, too. The Raiders are getting gashed on the ground and they'll need to close that floodgate in order to win home-field advantage in the AFC. Which, in my!
 h!
umble opinion, is crucial. You don't want to go to Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game, and if the Jets continue to broil, you certainly don't want to play at the Meadowlands during the postseason. One more note: Rich Gannon must be the most consistent quarterback of the century. Two picks in a passing offense, especially with the running game in drydock? What a terrific player. I like the Raiders, 27-20.

Catch Sports Illustrated's Peter King live from Philadelphia with the latest football news Sunday at 10 a.m. on NFL Preview.

POWER RANKINGS from SI's Dr. Z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) St. Louis Rams (8-1)
Nice try, Patriots. For a while your changing alignments and imaginative blitz schemes had 'em scratching their heads, but one thing that hasn't been written about this Rams team is its great intelligence on the go. I'm talking about the ability to make the proper adjustments while things are happening.  And even when a rusher or two leaks through, Warner can get to his hot reads so quickly and accurately that the defense is screwed.

2) Pittsburgh Steelers (7-2)
This seems to be the script now.  People load up to stop Bettis, Kordell counterpunches 'em accurately and effectively. I'd say that the way he has been playing, he rates among the league's top half dozen or so QBs.  Of course, he has the luxury of a heavy running game behind him.

3) Chicago Bears (7-2)
Yeah, they beat a fired-up Bucs team by throwing long, imagine; but strategically, the end of the game was not indicative of the coach's Yale degree.  Four straight kneels, which stopped the clock and gave the Bucs the ball with 0:18 left and a chance to tie the game with a final field goal. In a similar situation, Bill Parcells once had Neil O'Donnell pivot and heave the ball into the stands for a deliberate safety.  Personally I would have had Jim Miller doing a slow jog toward his own end zone far away, back, back --my god, what's the blighter doing? -- until either the clock runs out or he has given up the safety and then the Bears get to free kick it with a couple of seconds left.  The only problem with this strategy is that it ruins your rushing stats for the year.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. I'm sure Brian Billick will tell his players to put a sock in it  -- they're all taking jabs at his quarterback -- but it's becoming increasingly apparent that Elvis Grbac can't take the pressure, mentally and physically, of carrying an offense on his shoulders. Too bad. He's a good player. But he might be too psyched-out now to carry the Ravens to the playoffs.

2. Drew Bledsoe's future? Take this to the bank: It won't be in Houston, where former trusted Patriots offensive assistant Chris Palmer is the offensive coordinator. Bledsoe is too old -- 30 next season -- and too immobile for the Texans. If the draft were today, Houston would select Fresno State's David Carr, the quarterback with the best long-term chance for success as a passer in this class.

3. The change won't be made now, nor will it be made in the next week or two. But the Chargers can't take many more of those yo-yo performances from Doug Flutie. They won't hesistate to turn to Drew Brees. Norv Turner tells me Brees is the smartest quarterback he's ever been around, which is saying something considering he's coached Troy Aikman and Flutie and Trent Green and Jeff Hostetler.

UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Keep an eye on Seahawks defensive back Curtis Fuller. The 2001 fourth-round pick can play corner or safety and against the Bills had eight tackles and two passes defended. Mark my words: He will continue to get more playing time each week and will emerge as one of the best dime backs in the league by year's end.

FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSI.com's James Quintong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
Rod Smith left Sunday's game early with his sprained ankle and he might be worth stashing on your bench this week. Given the short week because the Broncos will be playing on Thanksgiving, Smith may not have time to recover properly and may not be ready to go. If that happens, you could take a chance on one of the Denver tight ends since the backup receivers don't have much fantasy potential.

Lamar Smith has been very disappointing in recent weeks, averaging only 46 yards per game over his last five outings. He has a very favorable matchup this weekend as the Dolphins take on the Bills, so he should have a good game. If he struggles again, it may be time to send him to the bench permanently.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

MATCHUP OF THE WEEK by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
A few years ago, when Jimmy Johnson was coach of the Dolphins, he took a jog near Miami's training facility one day around lunchtime. A car drove up next to him. The window was rolled down. ""Hey Jimmy!'' the guy driving said. ""J! E! T! S! JetsJetsJets!'' That's the silly chant that reverberates throughout Giants Stadium when the Jets are ""home.'' It's not something the Dolphins like to hear. Miami has made the playoffs in each of the last four seasons but hasn't managed to beat New York in that span. And this week, things might be more difficult than usual. New York gets its first-round pick, dangerous speed receiver Santana Moss, back to pair opposite Laveranues Coles in three-receiver sets, with Wayne Chrebet moving to the slot. At the same time, rookie Jamar Fletcher replaces the injured Sam Madison at corner for Miami, thinning the Dolphins' secondary at a very bad time. A few weeks ago, Zach Thomas told me the ""New York thing'' plays on his team's mind. With Curtis Mart!
in!
 running as well as he's been, I don't look for that to change this week. Jets, 24-22.

Catch Sports Illustrated's Peter King live from Miami with the latest football news Sunday at 10 a.m. on NFL Preview.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
POWER RANKINGS from SI's Dr. Z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) St. Louis Rams (7-1)
Now it comes out that Kurt Warner's sprained thumb is the reason why he's been throwing interceptions. And then there was a stretch in which Marshall Faulk was out. And still the army moves on. Frankly, I feel much more comfortable with this team up at the top where it belongs.

2) Pittsburgh Steelers (6-2)
They went for the body in the early rounds against the Browns, and then when the fight was on the line, the sack machine and the Bus moved in for a knockout against a worn-down opponent. It was classic strongarm football, and right now a Steelers-Rams Super Bowl is an intriguing prospect, although I'm not predicting it. No one wants to make Ravens and Raiders and Dolphins and Bengals and Chiefs fans mad.

3) Green Bay Packers (6-2)
I still say their defense is the unsung hero of the drama. You can expect the Pack to be up here for a while. The toughest part of their schedule is behind them.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SI's Peter King
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. If Tennessee's lost season isn't in enough trouble, quarterback Steve McNair, who is nursing about six injuries right now, couldn't grip a ball at practice Wednesday and may have to sit out the week.

2. Steve Mariucci just can't stand people not liking him, which is why his feud with standout receiver Terrell Owens bugs him so much. Owens is acting so small in this case. He'll never admit he's wrong. But the 49ers simply cannot let this thing fester, because we're talking about one of the 10 most dangerous players in the game right now.

3. Michael Strahan has a bulging disk in his back. No worry, apparently. He's been playing with it for a couple of years, and surgery isn't needed. Must not be, with 15 sacks in six games.

4. The Patriots have no intention of putting Drew Bledsoe back in the lineup anytime soon. Would you? Tom Brady is 5-2 and playing more efficiently than Bledsoe has in three years.

UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
How about Falcons quarterback Doug Johnson? All you hear out of Atlanta is about the battle for playing time between veteran Chris Chandler and top draft pick Michael Vick. But it was the little-known Johnson who threw a late touchdown and ran the offense for the winning score against the Cowboys. Johnson was an undrafted free agent out of Florida in 2000. In limited action as a rookie he completed 36 of 67 passes and threw two touchdowns but until Sunday he hadn't yet been involved in a winning pro effort.

FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSI.com's James Quintong
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
After a slow start, Washington's Stephen Davis has been on a roll, averaging just under 112 yards per game over his last four games, improving his rushing total in each of those four contests. He'll face a tough Denver defense that's allowing just 99 yards per game, but Davis is a good enough runner to overcome that.

Arizona's David Boston is one of the surprise fantasy performers of the year, leading the league with an average of 108 yards per game receiving. However, he has just one touchdown, a big letdown given all of his yardage production. Boston could have a great chance to get a couple of touchdowns under his belt this weekend against a Lions' team allowing a league worst 16 TDs through the air.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count. 
Please call Shirley Crenshaw at 3-5290 to register.

Pizza and soft drinks will be served.

Matchup of the Week 
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/black1x1.gif>	  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/helmets/sd.chargers.sm.gif>  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/helmets/den.broncos.sm.gif>	
by SI's Peter King	

After I, along with most of the western world, declared the Broncos the favorites in the AFC West this fall, they've now been beaten to the kind of Gerry Cooney pulp that makes their top-flight status quite shaky. They're the third-highest scoring team in their own division, for crying out loud. (San Diego 132, Oakland 131, Denver 123.) And quarterback Brian Griese has a bum throwing shoulder; he has far less zip on the ball. Trouble, with a capital T, especially now that he has to play without Ed McCaffrey. Even though the Chargers have lost two straight weeks on the road to beatable Cleveland and New England, you have to like their chances to win at a fever-pitched Qualcomm. I like Doug Flutie to play big in a big game. Flutie and new offensive coordinator Norv Turner have made some beautiful music together in the first third of the season, which is pretty remarkable considering this is about the 64th offense Flutie's had to learn since leaving Boston College. ""It's tou! gh! when you have to keep learning new offenses,'' Flutie tells me, ""but you have to wipe the slate clean and start fresh. A lot of guys carry some baggage when they go from one place to another. You say, We used to to do it this way, or call it such and such, and you think of it in those terms. But you have to erase that. I've been pretty good at doing that. And the bottom line here is, I believe in Norv Turner, and I will try to do it his way. It's worked well so far.""

from SI's Dr. Z 	
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/helmets/st.rams.sm.gif>	St. Louis Rams (5-0) 
The Giants figured out how to slow them down: Put your best pass rusher on a guy who's playing with a separated shoulder and a broken hand.	
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/helmets/gb.packers.sm.gif>	Green Bay Packers (4-1) 
Superb work by the offensive line against the Baltimore rush made a statement. Without heat on the quarterback, a zone defense -- anyone's, even that of the Ravens -- is fresh meat for a hungry lion like Brett Favre.	
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/helmets/ok.raiders.sm.gif>	Oakland Raiders (4-1) 
Why look for problems after a good road victory, but we must point out that the 101 yards gained on the ground was the most by the Raiders this year, and sooner or later it's gonna catch up with them.

What You Need to Know by SI's Peter King
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/black1x1.gif>


1. Butch Davis believes just what his old boss in Dallas, Jimmy Johnson, believes when it comes to draft choices. In jettisoning a player they were not using prominently, defensive lineman Stalin Colinet, to Minnesota, the Browns upgraded a seventh-round draft pick to a fifth-rounder. Now Cleveland has the most picks in the 2002 draft, 10, of any team in the league but expansion Houston.

2. With the No. 1 pick in next April's draft, Houston likely will not reach for either of the two top-tier quarterbacks available, Oregon's Joey Harrington and Fresno State's David Carr. My sleeper picks for the Texans' Opening Day QB: Shane Matthews or that kid with the Texas name and California 'tude, Cade McNown.

3. Good for Mike Holmgren. He's not wavering on putting Matt Hasselbeck back in the lineup next week at Miami. Here's the thing with the Seahawks' QB situation: You'll never find the upside of Hasselbeck unless you play him. Remember, it was late in Brett Favre's second year as a starter when assistant coaches on the Green Bay staff urged Holmgren to yank him. Hasselbeck needs time, even with the pennant race on the line.

4. Underrated Defensive Player of the Year so far: Pittsburgh rookie linebacker Kendrell Bell, a force as an inside and outside player. He has 20 tackles and three sacks in his last three games. And doesn't that make the Cowboys sick. This was the player Jerry Jones bypassed to select Quincy Carter, trumping the Dallas draft board.

Unsung Heroes
  <http://i.cnn.net/si/email/pro_football_extra/images/black1x1.gif>
by CNNSI.com's Pat Kirwan 	

Wide receiver Hines Ward was supposed to watch two first-round draft picks take over starting roles at his position in Pittsburgh. But Plaxico Burress and Troy Edwards haven't developed the way Ward has. In the past two weeks he has caught 12 balls for 106 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, backup running back Amos Zereoue has been giving the Steelers a change of pace when Jerome Bettis has needed a break. In the last two games, Zereoue has rushed 16 times for 102 yards. In my book, that makes him a productive player behind the scenes and a guy a number of teams would start if they had him on their roster.

by CNNSI.com's James Quintong 

It looks like it's safe to play Terry Glenn after he had a huge game against the Chargers on Sunday. He could be in for another big effort as the Patriots take on the Colts. The Indianapolis defense is still very spotty, allowing New England to put up 44 points in Week 3. Glenn's return could help the value of Tom Brady, who you might want to pick up if you're desperate for quarterback help.

Tim Biakabutuka hasn't had much of a season so far, but this could be the week to play him as the Panthers take on the Redskins, who have the worst run defense in the NFL. In fact, until proven otherwise, any decent running back playing Washington that week will be a recommended play.

"Slower Reporting Runtimes","Hi All,

We've been looking into determining why certain reports are taking longer to run than usual.

After examining the log, it seems that, either by fact or coincidence, the longer runtimes 
began to occur after our migration to the new database server -- no code had been changed.

Although there are other possible causes to investigate, we can start by rebooting 
our machines to ensure there aren't any issues caused by low memory on the machines 
running reporting jobs as scheduled tasks. 

We will continue to look into the possible cause of the bottle neck, and will seek to have it resolved
this week.  However in the meantime please reboot your machine if it is running scheduled
reporting jobs.

Thanks,
Kim

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Please call me if you have any questions.

"Aggie Announcements","Howdy Ags!  Here are a few announcements and some information we thought you might find useful as the holidays get close.

Aggie Yell Practice and a Pre-Yell Party will be held at the Sam Houston Race Park on Thursday, December 27, 2001.  The pre-yell party includes a concert performance by Roger Creager '93.  For more information, click here: http://www.aggienetwork.com/whats_new/agreception.html

Franklin Covey has introduced a new line of Aggie planners!  They include great photos from Aggieland, and lots of fun Aggie trivia.  For information or to order, click here: http://www.franklincovey.com/texasam/

Send a special holiday message to our men and women in the military, many of them Texas Aggies, defending American freedom worldwide.  Concerns about mail delivery have prompted the military to suspend this year's letter-writing campaign. However, the United States military is providing this private and secure online resource that will allow you to share your special holiday message. We thought Aggies might enjoy participating.  To send your message, click here: http://anyservicemember.navy.mil/

The Association of Former Students wishes you a happy and safe holiday season, and lots of good bull in 2002.

"News about your Fantasy Baseball league","Just a note to thank you for playing CBS SportsLine.com 
Fantasy Baseball. We hope you enjoyed a successful season.

Your Fantasy league's web site will be accessible during the
offseason. However, sometime during the week of November 26, 
we must take your league off-line so we can prepare it for 
the offseason. 

After that week, your league will be accessible again, and
your most important data will remain available. This data 
includes final 2001 standings, rosters, schedule and results 
(in head-to-head leagues), the league transaction report, 
message board posts and league news articles.

If there are any other reports you'd like to keep, please 
visit your site this week and save them. You can do this by 
clicking the ""sheet"" icon above a report to open the report 
in a spreadsheet, and then saving the spreadsheet on your 
hard drive.

Thank you again for playing CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy 
Baseball. Have a great offseason, and please join us for 
Opening Day 2002!

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Bill here's the list of action items from our meeting today.

Network Segment -- Perhaps NAHOU-SQGN02P and NAHOU-SQFND01P were on different network segments and experiencing different traffic loads -- Bill will check into this.
Maintenance Schedule -- Performance might be related to disk backups -- Bill will check into this.
Resource Utilization -- Other processes might be gobbling up resources causing contention -- Bill will check into this.

Thanks for visiting with us today.

We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"We need your help!","Howdy!

We need your help!  Earlier this week, a letter was sent to you asking you to renew your support for The Association of Former Students in 2001.  Because of the time sensitivity of this request, we wanted to make sure you received this message via e-mail as well.

This year is almost over and The Association is just below our goal of raising six million dollars for Texas A&M in 2001.  We need your help to allow us to provide critical unrestricted funds to the University that directly support the students and former students of Texas A&M.

To learn more about how The Association supports Aggies everywhere and to donate on-line by December 31st, please visit www.AggieNetwork.com.

With your support, The Association has always met Texas A&M's financial needs.  Your continued support in 2001 and beyond will ensure the traditions and spirit that make Texas A&M so special to us all remain in tact.

Thank you and Gig 'em,

Matt Jennings '95
Director of Annual Giving

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.
