I sent her an email thanking her and answering her questions. I will follow-up with a phone call later this week when I get back from Fort Lauderdale-have to go there for work. 

On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.  I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.  Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.  It gave me some good insight.

Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.  I have to join the LONGEST conference call in the world in a couple minutes.  Cheers,
Beth

Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

"RE: FW: Suzette's friend","Thanks for the insight.  Hopefully, we will be able to set something up.

I didn't really think FPL was going to have something, but it doesn't hurt to try.  I am now trying to find someone I can network with or through at Progress Energy, formerly Florida Power.  Don't have a cousin there do ya??  Just kidding...

But seriously, when your schedule allows, I would love to buy you a drink as a thank you.  You have been great.

Dear Joe,
 
Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at about 3:00 p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you could come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my son's soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for you???

"(no subject)","hey you! someone sent me this e-mail, and i thought of you. it's kind of long, but read it anyways ok-bye. 
maybe god wanted us to meet the wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. 
maybe when the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us. 
maybe the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. 
maybe it's true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it, but it is also true that  we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives. 
giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they will love you back. don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their hearts; but if it does not, be content it grew in yours. 
it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. 
don't go for looks; they can deceive. don't go for wealth; even that fades away. go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. find the one that makes your heart smile. 
there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real. 
dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you only have one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. 
may you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. 
always put yourself in other's shoes. if you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. 
the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. 
happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only that can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. 
love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. 
the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. 
when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. live you life so that when you die, you are the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Startup Mining Company Hopes to Expand
Only U.S. Fluorspar Mine, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Located close to Cedar City, Utah, a start-up mining
venture hopes to expand the only fluorspar mine in the U.S. According
to company's President, John Price, ""Milford Mining Company LLC is the
only miner of fluorspar in the U.S."" Price went on to say, ""We've
started of on a small scale, but our market shows promise and if all
goes well, we may look at expanding in the future.""
	   According to data collected by the USGS, the U.S. consumes
approximately 523,000 metric tons of fluorspar annually. All of this
is imported from foreign sources, 67% from China, 22% from South
Africa, and 11% from Mexico. The majority of this, about 90%, is acid
grade fluorspar used in the production of hydrofluoric acid and
aluminum fluoride.
	   Milford Mining produces metallurgical grade fluorspar and also
kaolinite and silica. It is studying options for the sale of these
minerals to new markets. Currently, it sells fluorspar to west coast
cement plants, where it is used as a fluxing agent in rotary kilns.
Fluorspar helps to reduce the melting temperature of clinker (an
intermediate product of the cement manufacturing process produced in
rotary kilns), enabling cement producers to increase throughput
without significant equipment additions. Future plans include adding
increased crushing, screening, and processing equipment to enable the
company to expand service to the cement industry, as well as other
metallurgical grade fluorspar users such as the steel or aluminum
industries and possibly acid grade fluorspar users at some point in
the future.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) U.S. Petroleum Refining Industry Can
Expect a 5% Growth in 2002 for Capital and Maintenance Spending, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 26, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (industrial Information Resources
Incorporated: Houston ). According to the recently released 2002
Industrial Outlook, the U.S. Petroleum Refining industry is expected
to see an increase of 5% in annual capital and maintenance spending
for 2002. This increase in spending is partially a result of
environmental compliance issues requiring refineries to produce
cleaner fuels and reduce Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP's).
	   The spring and summer of 2001 brought unusually high gasoline and
crude oil prices, delaying many planned maintenance turnarounds.
However, in the late summer and early fall of 2001, the high prices
retracted which led to the acceleration of many of the late fall
planned turnarounds. 2001 capital spending focused on the
implementation of new technologies and process changes to increase
product yields. With a less than optimistic outlook for margins in
2002, spending could likely be isolated to environmental and
maintenance programs for the coming year. These topics and more are
included in the recently released 2002 Industrial Outlook published by
Industrial Information Resources and available on CD-ROM.

market place including industry alerts and database for the energy and

But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/28/01 ! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - G money Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free Ag! en! t Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - God Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no ma! tt! er what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touch! do! wn Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - God Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

"RE: Discovery Responses","Joe,

If you would be so kind as to bring your address book and/or a list of
family and friends, including addresses and phone numbers, of those who have
knowledge of this situation, especially your mom and sister and anyone who
had firsthand knowledge (not just things you've told them, but things they
knew or experienced) of the issues in this case.  For instance, a coworker
might know things you've told while all this has been going on, but a common
friend or neighbor would have more significant knowledge.

Also, if you would go through the Interrogatories and take a stab at
answering the questions that you have answers to, it will save you a lot of
attorney fee time.

Thanks!
Jonda

   Joe-

   I can't guarantee what time he will call today, but it will have to be
   between appointments.  As he will be at a seminar all next week, his
   appointments were scheduled VERY tight this week, along with three days
   of
   depositions which have been scheduled for over 2 months.  It may not be
   until this evening.  He has your work and cell phone numbers.

      Jonda,

      I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me
      and
      my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I
      have
      cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails
      (trying
      to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to
   do
      that
      so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will
      forward
      them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I
      really
      think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or
   she
      is
      mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

      Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to
   go
      over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury
      trial?
      Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the
   something
      to
      Tonya?  I don't understand....

      I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting
   for
      work
      (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after
      3:30.
      I hope that helps

      Thanks again,

      -Joe

         Dear Joe,

         I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back
         meetings,
         hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a
      short
         telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition
         schedule
         may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge
      rules
         at a
         hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the
   Court,
      I
         could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

         I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery
         responses
         because I will be out of town next week and they are due next
   Friday.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/26/01 Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play.    Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   ""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said.    James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 12/26/01 Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again.   Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 12/26/01 Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/26/01 Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this week.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 12/26/01 Muhammad is still battling a turf toe injury. His status for Week 16 is still unclear.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the Chiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/26/01 Gadsden (hamstring) might miss his second consecutive game this week. Chris Chambers may start in his place again.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 12/26/01 Taylor (groin) has returned to practices and is working with the scout team. He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this point of the playoffs.   Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 12/26/01 Smith (ankles) has returned to practice. He is expected to play this week.   Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 12/26/01 Ismail is recovering from a mild concussion. He is expected to play this week.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Starboy Updated 12/26/01 Galloway is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week.   Bert Emanuel  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Emanuel is day to day with an ankle injury. His status for the upcoming week is unclear right now.   James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 McKnight is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to play this week.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - G money Updated 12/26/01 Brunell is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this week.   Mike McMahon , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 McMahon may miss some practice time this week with a foot injury. His status for this week's game is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start in his place if he can't play.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 12/26/01 Brookins may be able to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry Allen and Moe Williams will continue to split carries.   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/25/01 Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. The Buccaneers may sign a free agent kicker to replace him in Week 16.  Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     More Updates   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]God Player News  Wesley Walls , Active TE Updated 12/26/01 Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this week.   Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01 Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina.   Troy Brown , Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs.   Terrell Owens , Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this week.   Stacey Mack , Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01 Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining weeks.   Qadry Ismail , Reserve WR Updated 12/21/01 Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs.   James Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01 The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson, who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use during the Fantasy playoffs.   Ricky Watters , Injured RB Updated 12/19/01 Watters has placed on injured reserve. He will not play again this season. Shaun Alexander will be the starter for Seattle's final three games.   Buccaneers , Active DT Updated 12/18/01 DT Warren Sapp (shoulder) and CB Ronde Barber (hamstring) were both injured during Sunday's loss to Chicago. They will be limited in practice this week, but should be available for Week 15.   Shaun Alexander , Active RB Updated 12/17/01 A season-ending ankle injury to Ricky Watters makes Alexander the main man in Seattle again. Expect him to put up good, if not spectacular numbers in the team's final three games.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco. The Miami RB has been very inconsistent in recent weeks, but he still may be good for a few TD runs during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.   Mike Vanderjagt , Reserve K Updated 12/16/01 Vanderjagt (back) is healthy enough to handle all the kicking duites for Indianapolis this week. As a result, the team released Doug Brien, who was used in last Monday night's loss to Miami.   Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 12/16/01 Brady had another disappointing game, throwing for 237 yards, no TDs and an interception at Buffalo. All of a sudden, the New England QB appears to be a Fantasy risk during the most important weeks of the year.  Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 11/30/01 Dilger has been a major disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. With Marcus Pollard emerging as the Colts primary tight end, Dilger has very little Fantasy value.   Browns , Reserve DT Updated 09/23/01 The Browns allowed just 14 points during Sunday's game against Detroit, and racked up two sacks and seven interceptions in the process. Cleveland's defense is a tad underrated and has some Fantasy value in deeper leagues, but keep in mind that the high interception total was mainly due to an ineffective game by Ty Detmer.  John Carney , Active K Updated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.

He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/23/01  Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - God Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Perrito-style Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hurricanes Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Tacos Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

I cannot believe Larry Dierker resigned, although he probably would have been fired anyway.  This Saturday is full of great games and of couse I have to work until 2:00, ridiculous.  Later

What's up? 
I will be coming in town the weekend of Nov 1st - Nov 4th.  I hope you 
don't have plans for that Saturday.  I'll find out today if I can get him 
for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take 
him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick 
him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what you 
think?  My sister will probably also come (just for the day).  As soon as I 
find out I'll let you know. 
Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for the 
UT and Colorado game (Austin is an awesome place!!!)

   Bird, where you in town this weekend? I talked to your sister for a

   The Astros are good.  What's going on with Peyton? I am sure Tonya is 
   being reasonable again.

"RE:","Don't be so touchy!  I was only teasing. BTW, I tried to call you Sunday but you never left me your number. I left you 2 messages at work. Actually it was you who blew me off, thanks a lot. ; )

I'm off to Virginia late this morning so I may not see you. 

You are done on double or nothing, but I thought the bet was $20. I'm just a lowly originator, I can't afford big trader bets!

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin the week of October 15th.
Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.  
			Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information.
	3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored.  
Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on awaiting list for the course or courses indicated.
Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"RE: FW: Suzette's friend","Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.
Beth

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  Solar and wind power have long been used as renewable sources of energy.  On Wednesday, we'll have a report on an interesting alternative to these renewables.  ENL's Gale Smith will tell us about a Louisiana company that is using rice hulls to produce electricity.  Catch Gale's report from Houston tomorrow.   The Enron/Dynegy negotiations continue and Gale tells me the Houston bureau is keeping close tabs on all developments.   Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' David Hitchcock will talk to ENL's Kym McNicholas Wednesday about California's current credit rating.  The state is set to issue a proposed $12.5 billion in revenue bonds and Hitchcock will discuss whether renegotiating California's long-term power contracts could delay the process.     Kym will also speak with the Executive Director of the California Natural Gas Producers Association John Martini.  He'll address the unspecified threats to U.S. pipelines.  Watch for those details from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday.   We'll have an interview from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.  Alaron Trading Vice President Phil Flynn will join us to discuss the API and DOE numbers and tell us what's going on with the brewing OPEC price war.  We'll hear from Flynn during the noon ET newscast tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Nov. 27, 2001    Crude: $19.48 +$0.79   Unleaded: $0.5381 +$0.0164   Heating Oil: $0.5394 +$0.0177   Natural Gas: $2.606 -$0.09   We'll have live coverage from Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday. Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante is covering ""Alaska Resources 2002: Can Alaska Compete?""  Catch reports from Anchorage on Thursday.   Also on Thursday, ENL's Gale Smith will attend the Arctic Gas Symposium in Houston.  The symposium will address supplying the North American market and bring us a pipeline route update, among other topics.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems.

He is expected to play this week.   Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week.

Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/27/01 The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over.

Brian Griese , QB DEN - G money Updated 12/27/01 Griese told the Denver Post he is ready to take on the Broncos, although Mike Shanahan questioned how effective he would be in his return. ""How do you know with a concussion?"" Shanahan said. ""There should be no side effects. Hopefully there's not. But we have learned a lot through the years about concussions and how serious t! he! y can be, and hopefully that's something in the past and they won't reoccur.""

If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue.""     The Titans listed him as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/27/01 Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice, and indicated he might not play in the regular season's final two games. ""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing, that means not playing,"" Bettis told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""But you want to make sure you're healed up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely.""   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/27/01 Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the Baltimore Ravens this week.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/26/01 Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play.    Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   ""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said.    James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 12/26/01 Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again.   Skip Hicks  , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 12/26/01 Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will start in his place.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again.    Seahawks  , DT SEA - G money Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - R-Diddy Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 12/28/01  Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issu! e ! after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.""

Hello, I just wanted to say I hope your weekend  went well.  Payton is growing like a weed.  He is now tickalish.   He also has learned how to scream, now that's about all he does.  He has a  walker and he loves to sit in it and just talk away.  He is such a happy  baby, everyone enjoys him and loves to see him, he's so pleasant.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - God Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Perrito-style Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hurricanes Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Tacos Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.   Johnnie Morton , WR DET - BCWD's Updated 12/21/01 Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated 12/21/01 Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 12/21/01 Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs.    Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 12/21/01 Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs.   More Updates  Schedule, Breakdown  [IMAGE][IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

"RE: Blackberry","You are the one letting her down, not me.  Your guilt trip won't work on me.  

Go to FAO Schwartz, they'll take care of you.  You can never go wrong with Barbies.  You can also ask her mother what she wants.  Of course my strategy was always to buy things that either made the biggest mess (paint, giant Play-Doh), had the most pieces, or made a lot of noise.  That way your niece loves you and your sister hates you.  Two wins in my book.

What about hot yoga?  I haven't been since Monday a week ago and I can't keep blowing it off.  It's about the only exercise I get!  Besides, what time do you usually leave every day?  3:00?  Some of us have to work a little later.

"Rockland Electric Transfer to PJM","On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joint application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJM of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

"results of football pool","Hello everyone, 

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. 

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. 

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. 

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name.

"RE: FW: Suzette's friend","I sent her an email thanking her and answering her questions. I will follow-up with a phone call later this week when I get back from Fort Lauderdale-have to go there for work. 

On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.  I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.  Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.  It gave me some good insight.

Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.  I have to join the LONGEST conference call in the world in a couple minutes.  Cheers,
Beth

Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

"RE: Discovery Responses","Dear Joe,

I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back meetings,
hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a short
telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition schedule
may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge rules at a
hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the Court, I
could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery responses
because I will be out of town next week and they are due next Friday.

   Dear Joe,

   Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at about 3:00
   p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you could
   come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my son's

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/23/01  Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - God Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Perrito-style Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hurricanes Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Tacos Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Starboy Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

"Suzette's friend","Hi Joe-
I am Suzette's friend-the one looking for jobs (on the sly of course) in the greater Tampa and/or St. Petersburg area.  She had suggested I send my resume to you for potential contacts at FPL and Bank of America.  

I am currently in the associate program but have a 'unique' concentration.  I was hired into the marketing track and have focused mainly on those areas here at Enron.  Let me know if you have any questions for me-here's a recent copy of my resume which includes my latest rotation.  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards,

Here's a neat opportunity to share some of your club's great Seminole
spirit!

Mike Palios is in charge of the parade this year, and together, Mike and I
are jointly extending this special invitation to ALL clubs to please join us
for the Sesquicentennial parade of Nov. 9th!

Please let me know if you are coming, for I might be able to help with
decorating your cars, and will ALSO want to hook up with each during
Saturday's pregame reception behind Garnet and Gold on Pensacola Street,
AFTER THE HOMECOMING breakfast Saturday AM.

We are strongly suggesting that if you ARE coming, bring your club banner,
and we can use bungee cords to attach it to the front of your cars!!!!!

If you or ANY of your club membership is coming in for Homecoming, sincerely
hope that your arrival will be in time to join the parade.

Thanks!

Best,

Terry

Club Presidents:

Here is your chance to get the entire FSU and Tallahassee Community to know
who you and your Club is.

This yesar, on Friday, November 9, 2001 at 1:50PM, the Sesquicentennial
Homecoming Parade will start, heading east on Call Street, turning right
(south) at Monroe Street, heading south to College Avenue and making the
final turn right, heading west, and ending at Westcott Fountain.  Line Up
for the Parade begins at 12 Noon at the Fine Arts building parking lot.

I have attached the Parade Confirmation form, if you are interested.  You
will be responsible to get your own car (I suggest getting a convertable if
possible!) and bring your Club banners so everyone knows who you are!  If
you don't have a Club banner, let me know immediately and we can make a sign
to put on the side of the cars.

Please contact me if you have any questions at all, and I hope to see many
of you that day!

Go Noles!

"Payton","
Joe, just wanted to give you and update on how  Payton is.  He is growing like a weed, he is now 16lbs and 5 ozs.  His  hair is getting thicker, I had to trim his hair over his ears because it was  getting long enough to tuck it behind his ears He is learning very fast, he can  move really well in his walker when he is on smooth flooring and he is praticing  everyday to sit up and crawl, it want be long.  He still talks alot and  never cries, he is such a wonderful baby.  He can turn around on his back  in a 360 turn and he can roll across the room, if nothing is in his  way. Wel, he is ready for me to get him out of his bed, I better  go!!
 
He looks forward to visiting with you  soon!

"Re: FW: Suzette's friend","

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will start in his place.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again.    Seahawks  , DT SEA - G money Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - R-Diddy Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.""

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

  Dear Joe Stepo,  Here is the latest NFL News from the Associated Press:  RAIDERS Oakland kicker Sebastian Janikowski fell at a nightclub due to ""an apparent drug overdose,"" cutting his face and requiring five stitches a few hours after the Raiders' game against Dallas, police said Tuesday.  Janikowski was taken to a hospital after patrons at the Sno-Drift Bar reported he had collapsed early Monday morning, police spokesman Dewayne Tully said.  Janikowski, 23, who attended team meetings later Monday, was not arrested, Tully said. A police report indicated the club's doorman told officers that Janikowski was ""possibly overdosing on GHB"" _ the so-called date-rape drug.  Last April in Florida, Janikowski was found innocent on charges of drug possession and evidence tampering in April in Florida after being accused of possessing GHB.  In the police report Monday, officers wrote they ""found Janikowski incoherent and wildly flailing around on the floor. As a result of the uncontrolled flailing, Janikowski hit his head on the floor and caused a cut over his right eye.""  Janikowski did not respond when officers talked to him, and he was placed in soft restraints on a gurney for the trip to the hospital, the police report said.  Janikowski's roommate, Jay Hoffman, told police the kicker was not taking drugs but that he was with an unidentified woman earlier in the night who may have slipped something into his drink.  Other witnesses told police they saw Janikowski voluntarily taking what appeared to be GHB and that he ""does it all the time.""  Paul Healy, the kicker's agent, said Janikowski needed stitches for a head wound. He said his client had been drinking, and said reports of a drug overdose were ""totally false.""  ""I know he was out there at a nightclub in San Francisco and slipped and fell. At a lot of these clubs, people spill their drinks, and he slipped and whacked his head,"" Healy said. ""You don't have a drug overdose Sunday night and go to practice Monday morning.""  Raiders coaches said Janikowski appeared fine Monday. The kicker, who has made all eight of his field goals this season, was not in the locker room in the hour that reporters are allowed access on days following games.  Janikowski, a native of Poland, was Oakland's first-round choice in the 2000 draft after starring at Florida State.  In June 2000, Janikowski was acquited on a charge he offered a Tallahassee policeman $300 to release his roommate after an argument with a bouncer who wouldn't let him into a local nightclub.  His contract includes a clause that will force him to pay back about $25,000 for every game he misses due to suspension. The clause was added because of his run-ins with the law.  CHIEFS Starters Derrick Alexander, Tony Richardson and Dante Hall will probably be out Sunday when Kansas City plays host to Pittsburgh.  The loss of Alexander, last year's team MVP and the Chiefs' only experienced wide receiver, will send the Chiefs (1-3) into the weekend dangerously short at the position.  Sylvester Morris, last year's No. 1 draft pick, has been out all year with a knee injury. Marvin ""Snoop"" Minnis, this year's top pick, has been inconsistent.  Inconsistency at wide receiver has been cited by coach Dick Vermeil as the top reason for quarterback Trent Green's problems. Green threw four interceptions last week in Denver.  ""It really makes us thin at wide receiver,"" said Vermeil. ""We count on Hall as one of our four wide receivers, but now we can't do that.""  Alexander, slowed all season with a sore Achilles' tendon, developed back spasms during pregame warmups last week before the Chiefs' loss at Denver. Although Alexander played, Vermeil said he ""couldn't bend over and tie his shoelaces"" on Monday.  Fullback Richardson, the Chiefs' most consistent performer on offense, also missed last week's game with a shoulder injury. Hall, a wide receiver/kick returner, has a ""deep contusion"" on a shoulder that has already undergone surgery.  ""It would take drastic change to all of a sudden have Tony Richardson back,"" Vermeil said. ""I think it's a better chance of having him a week from this weekend.""  The only healthy wide receivers left are Minnis, Chris Thomas and Larry Parker. Tight end Mikhael Ricks will probably be used in the position.  The Chiefs will be reduced to using defensive backs as wide receivers during practice. But Vermeil said he did not anticipate bringing in another wide receiver.  ""The problem with bringing guys in is you have to let somebody else go. Who? If guys are injured and go on injured reserve, they create their own roster vacancy,"" Vermeil said. ""But who do you want to sacrifice? It's not an easy thing to do.  ""Then if you do bring somebody in, will he suit up on Sunday? When you bring them on the roster and he can't automatically line up and play this weekend because he doesn't know the scheme, that really hurts you.""  One possibility would be Derrick Mayes. Signed to a free-agent contract last spring, the former Seattle starter was released after training camp.  ""We've talked to Mayes in the past about being in shape and being available,"" Vermeil said. ""He would be a logical guy because of his knowledge of our scheme. But who would we let go?""  Vermeil said Parker would probably return punts, but rookie running back Derrick Blaylock could be activated. Reserve running back Mike Cloud was expected to return kickoffs.  Richardson's loss is felt throughout the offense.  ""Tony Richardson might be the best player at his position in the league,"" Vermeil said. ""We miss his leadership. We miss his running. We miss his blocking. It's not easy to just plug somebody in.""  COWBOYS Rookie quarterback Quincy Carter is expected to be out two weeks for the Dallas Cowboys after straining his left hamstring in the loss against Oakland.  Anthony Wright, who replaced Carter in the first quarter, is set to face Washington in his third start of the season.  Carter had a MRI on Monday to determine the injury's severity.  ""My teammates know I can play,"" he told The Dallas Morning News on Tuesday. ""They know I have talent. I've just had some injury problems.""  Carter had returned to the lineup on Sunday after missing two games with a bruised thumb.  During an 8-yard run in the 28-21 loss to Oakland, Carter strained his hamstring. He finished the drive but did not return.  On his first play, Wright threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway, who ran past Pro Bowl cornerback Charles Woodson.  ""Anthony showed us that he can come off the bench and play with a limited number of repetitions in practice,"" coach Dave Campo said.  Wright completed 14 of 22 passes for 126 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He has been the quarterback when Dallas scored 44 of its 66 points this season.

"","On September 25, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission),  
revisions to its Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff (Services Tariff) and its Open-Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) to make
permanent two temporary market rules pertaining to External Transactions that were initially implemented as  Extraordinary Corrective Actions, and to introduce several new enhancements to its external transaction scheduling processes:  1) provisions to ensure that Exports are evaluated consistently for purposes of scheduling and curtailment by incorporating the concept of ""Sink Price Cap Bids"" into, and by eliminating the concept of ""default"" Decremental Bids, and 2) revising the time priod within which it will perform the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME).  Currently NYISO runs BME 90 minutes ahead of each dispatch hour.  The revisions would allow NYISO to use BME at any time no later than 90 minutes before the hour.    The NYISO has
     requested a waiver of the usual sixty day notice period so that
     this filing can become effective on October 30, 2001.

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

Subject: an object lesson

Dunno about you. I've run into a couple of people in the last week or so 
who believe that peace is, even at this point, our only viable option.

Sometimes, an object lesson is appropriate...

1) Approach the person who is talking about ""peace"" and saying there should
be, ""no retaliation.""

2) Engage in brief conversation, ask if military force is appropriate.

3) When he says ""No,"" ask, ""Why not?""

4) Wait until he says something to the effect of,
""Because that would just cause more innocent deaths, which would be
awful and we should not cause more violence.""

5) When he's in mid-sentence, punch him in the face as hard as you can.

6) When he gets back up to up to punch you, point out that it would be a
mistake and contrary to his values to strike you, because that would, ""be
awful and he should not cause more violence.""

7) Wait until he agrees that he has pledged not to commit additional
violence.

8) Punch him in the face again, harder this time.

Repeat steps 5 through 8 until they understand that sometimes it is
necessary to punch back.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith  , WR JAC - R-Diddy Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash  , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.""   Doug Brien , K IND - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the c! lu! b wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Hurricanes Updated 12/28/01 According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report, Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 12/27/01 Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants.   Patrick Jeffers  , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place.   Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - El-Gato Updated 12/27/01 Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week.   Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito-style Updated 12/27/01 Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/27/01 The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 12/27/01 Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.

Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven a! s ! the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and ! co! uld miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times. ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Favre i! nj! ured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""  James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 10/22/01 Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the Chicago Tribune reports that the Bears will continue to use an alternating system with him and ! Ja! mes Allen. ""We will continue to use them both,"" said offensive coordinator John Shoop. ""Anthony did a great job today, though."" As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.  Robert Wilson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be evaluated on a daily basis.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 10/22/01 Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception. Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/! 01!  Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards on Sunday.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status i! s ! day to day.  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - G money Updated 10/22/01 Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against Detroit.  J.R. Redmond , RB NE - G money Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 1! 0/! 22/01 Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week;s game is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/22/01 Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the Baltimore Sun, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a daily basis.  ! Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength, but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on November 4.    Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 10/22/01 Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-G! at! o Updated 10/22/01 Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season. Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.  Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will be the primary receiver in his absence.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.  Ricky Williams , RB NO - R-Diddy Updated 10/22/01 Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21 carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the second half. ""We couldn't do anything in the second half,"" Williams said. ""We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made plays."" Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams this Sunday.    Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 10/22/01 Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for the rest of the season.   Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - God Updated 10/22/01 Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) U.S. Forest Products Industry Shows
Signs of Getting Out of the Woods in Late 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). The year ahead will be challenging for America's forest
products industry, much like 2001. Weak demand for some products
combined with a sluggish economy will continue to plague the industry
through most of 2002. Getting out of the ""woods"" will be determined by
how well manufacturers match production to demand, more industry
consolidation and by limiting capital spending.
	   Capacity expansion is mostly non-existent and growth will be less
than 1%, as plants will still have to contend with production
curtailments through the first half of 2002. Producers have indicated
that machines will no longer run outright, but instead run closer to
demand. By the third quarter of next year, producers expect to see a
significant reduction in high inventories that could trigger long
awaited price increases.
	   Industry consolidation has become necessary for growth as well as
a way to survive in a global marketplace. More mergers and
acquisitions are in line for the industry next year. In the midst of
shuffling manufacturing assets, business groups and marketing
strategies, more of the country's plants will close permanently.
Additionally, consolidation will lead to some U.S. plants falling into
the hands of foreign companies. For some plants, new ownership could
mean an injection of much needed capital investments.
	   Industrial Information Resources recently published 2002
Industrial Outlook (http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm),
available on CD-ROM, projects a whopping 20% decline in capital
spending compared to 2001. Though seemingly dismal, spending will be
sustained by environmental projects, the need to replace aging
equipment and by investments that yield high returns in the short
term.

market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   Just a reminder - On Friday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante is live in Cairo, Egypt covering the OPEC meeting.  Join us tomorrow as Kim brings us the latest on possible oil production cuts beginning in January.      We'll also have more reaction from here in Washington to the OPEC meeting.  American Petroleum Institute Chief Economist John Felmy, Ph.D., will share his thoughts on the cartel's moves and what they might mean for the U.S.  Also during the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast, The Petroleum Finance Company Senior Market Analyst George Beranek will give us his assessment of the market if OPEC follows through with a production cut.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has had a very busy year - from the California crisis to the crisis at Enron, the Commission has had a full docket.  On Friday during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast, we'll hear what former FERC Chairman James Hoecker thinks about the past year at the FERC and what issues may surface during the New Year.   As the year draws to a close, the Houston bureau will take a look back at one of the biggest energy stories - the collapse of the energy giant, Enron.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says on Friday, the Houston bureau will review the timetable of Enron's demise, the effects of its bankruptcy filing, layoffs and the company's downgraded credit rating.    As Texas deregulation nears, competition in the market is heating up among retail energy providers.  The Houston bureau says the Texas Public Utility Commission set the price to beat for areas in the state, and competing retail energy providers are beating those prices.  We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says on Friday, California Senator Debra Bowen talks about what to expect from the legislature in the first few weeks of 2002.  Kym says possible topics of discussion include the issuance of the state's $12.5 billion in energy bonds, the California Power Authority and plans to get Southern California Edison and PG?out of debt.   Also on Friday from the West Coast bureau, California Energy Commissioner Michael Moore talks about the gas supplies in California.  Join us for these reports and more from Sacramento tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Thursday, Dec. 27, 2001    Crude: $20.90/bbl -$0.37   Unleaded: $0.5927/gallon -$0.0086   Heating Oil: $0.5815/gallon -$0.0131   Gas: $2.555/mmBtu -$0.356   Broadcasting Note: On New Year's Eve, we're broadcasting through 1:00 p.m. ET.  We're dark on New Year's Day.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Re: FW: Stepenovitch","

I guess in the scheme of things one of the reasons you try not to go to
trial is to prevent this from happening.  Plus it takes a long time to
prepare for the case and it looks like your attorney wants to win.  Do you
want me to call Tonya and explain to her that going forward things are not
going to be pretty.  I think I can do this in a gentle and concerning way.
Or should I not be involved?
Love,
Mom

"Orders issued today in NYISO and ISO-NE proceedings","Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

He has yet to be added to the team's active roster, and is questionable for Week 17 against Kansas City.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/31/01 Gramatica missed Saturday's game against Baltimore due to a leg injury. He will attempt to practice on Wednesday, but early indications seem to point to Doug Brien handling the kicking duties in Week 17.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 12/31/01 Wycheck left Sunday's game against Cleveland in the first quarter due to a thigh bruise. He did not return to the game and is listed as day to day.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 12/31/01 According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , Hasselbeck (shoulder) hopes to play in Seattle's season finale. However, it seems more likely that Trent Dilfer will start for the second consecutive week.  Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - BCWD's Updated 12/31/01 Jurevicius suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He was able to finish the contest, but was held to only one catch for 18 yards.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 12/31/01 Barber suffered a slightly sprained ankle during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He was able to finish the contest, and compiled 158 all-purpose yards in the Giants' 24-21 loss.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 12/31/01 Davis suffered a sprained ankle during Sunday night's win over New Orleans. He was removed from the game for precautionary measures, and is expected to start in Week 17 against Arizona.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - El-Gato Updated 12/31/01 Buckhalter suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's 24-21 win over the N.Y. Giants. The rookie tailback is listed as day to day.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Minor got most of the carries during Sunday's 21-14 win over Atlanta. The rookie compiled 98 all-purpose yards and a touchdown in the game, and may have overtaken Lamar Smith as Miami's featured back.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 12/31/01 Zereoue suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's game against Cincinnati. He left in the first quarter and did not return to the contest. He is listed as day to day.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Baxter suffered a sprained ankle during Sunday's 24-0 win over Detroit. He is listed as day to day.   Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Byrd suffered a concussion and a leg bruise during Sunday's 30-7 loss to Arizona. He may be listed as questionable for Week 17 against New England, but his current status is day to day.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Hayes suffered a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against Arizona. He could be listed as questionable for Week 17 against New England, but his current status is day to day.  Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/31/01 Kelly suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's 21-14 loss to the Miami Dolphins. He was unable to return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 12/31/01 Chandler left Sunday's game against Miami in the second quarter after suffering an injury to his right elbow. X-rays were negative, but Chandler did not return to the game. He is listed as day to day.   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 12/30/01 Bettis has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will start in his place.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - G money Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - G money Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.

"results of this week's football pool","Hello Everyone,

	We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia
defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight. We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!! Therefore Joe won $66. Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.

Jonda,

I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me and
my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I have
cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails (trying
to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do that
so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will forward
them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I really
think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she is
mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go
over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury trial?
Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something to
Tonya?  I don't understand....

I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for work
(not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after 3:30.
I hope that helps

Thanks again,

-Joe

   Dear Joe,

   I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back
   meetings,
   hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a short
   telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition
   schedule
   may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge rules
   at a
   hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the Court, I
   could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

   I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery
   responses
   because I will be out of town next week and they are due next Friday.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) French Chemical and Explosives Producer
Creates Measure to Self-Regulate, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2001--The following in an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Groupe SNPE (Paris, France) announced
plans on December 10, 2001 to regulate and improve safety at it three
plants in Toulouse, France. SNPE announced that it would spend several
million francs to improve plant safety at it Toulouse facilities. The
plan includes the formation of a commission of local delegates with
the authority to order investigations and acquire knowledge about
safety issues relating to the three plants. Included in SNPE's plan is
the limitation of storage tank capacity to two tons and limiting
access of non-authorized personel to the plant. The neighboring
Atofina Grande Paroisse fertilizer plant explosion in September
damaged SNPE's three plants. These plants have been shut down since
the explosion pending a decision by the French government as to
regulations concerning the proximity of industrial plants to
residential areas.
	   SNPE's announcement came a day before Yves Cochet, the French
Environmental Minister, conducted national debates with nearly 7,000
people regarding industrial site proximity to residential areas. On
November 13, 2001, SNPE opened its plants in Toulouse for neighboring
residents to tour. Tours involved explanations of SNPE's manufacturing
process as well as the practical applications of their products.
	   Groupe SNPE was founded in 1971 and produces fine chemicals plus
explosives and propellants used in the pharmaceutical, intermediates,
agrochemical, and defense industries. The company's products are
marketed in 70 different countries and have subsidiaries in Asia,
Europe, and North America.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"RE: Discovery Responses","Joe-

I can't guarantee what time he will call today, but it will have to be
between appointments.  As he will be at a seminar all next week, his
appointments were scheduled VERY tight this week, along with three days of
depositions which have been scheduled for over 2 months.  It may not be
until this evening.  He has your work and cell phone numbers.

   Jonda,

   I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me
   and
   my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I
   have
   cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails
   (trying
   to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do
   that
   so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will
   forward
   them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I
   really
   think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she
   is
   mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

   Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go
   over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury
   trial?
   Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something
   to
   Tonya?  I don't understand....

   I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for
   work
   (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after
   3:30.
   I hope that helps

   Thanks again,

   -Joe

      Dear Joe,

      I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back
      meetings,
      hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a
   short
      telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition
      schedule
      may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge
   rules
      at a
      hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the Court,
   I
      could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

      I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery
      responses
      because I will be out of town next week and they are due next Friday.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

"FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel","

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.
