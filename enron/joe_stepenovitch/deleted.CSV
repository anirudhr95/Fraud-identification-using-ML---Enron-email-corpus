( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Expansion Brewing at Coors, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 29, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). The country's third largest beer brewer, Adolph Coors
Company (NYSE:RKY) (Golden, Colo.), is underway with a $68 million
program to increase brewing capacity through an expansion at their
Memphis, Tennessee brewery. The program began over a year ago with the
goal of increasing brewing capacity by a million barrels per year.
	   The challenge is to increase capacity without having to shut down
and lose the current 3.8 million barrel per year production volume.
Utilizing in-house engineering talent and support from alliance
engineering firm Jacobs Engineering Group (Pasadena, Calif.), Coors
has developed a plan to achieve this through strategic replacement of
old equipment and automation integration. The project also involves
implementation of a new technology, which removes oxygen that can be
harmful to malt during the brewing process.
	   With all of these systems in place along with brewing and
packaging debottlenecks, Coors hopes to achieve its goal of increasing
capacity by February of 2003. Peter H. Coors, chairman of Coors
Brewing Company, added, ""The beer industry has had a flat year;
however, the company has high expectations from the Memphis brewery
and its ability to increase volume.""
	   Coors reported net sales of $1.87 billion for the first three
quarters of this year and have released third quarter net income
increase of thirteen percent compared with the same period last year.
Coors brews about 23 million barrels per year between its Golden,
Colorado and Memphis, Tennessee breweries, making it the third largest
domestic brewer.
	   For more information on trends and upcoming construction
activities in the Food and Beverage market as well as other industrial
sectors send inquiries to foodandbeveragegroup@industrialinfo.com or

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - BCWD's Updated 10/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major scoring! t! hreat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   M! ic! hael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - G money Updated 10/21/01  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - G money Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started S! un! day's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Kar Bombs Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detr! oi! t. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - G money Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-qua! li! ty Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - R-Diddy Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Betti!  , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Perrito-style Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sun! da! y, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Perrito-style Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Starboy Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy num! be! rs.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error U! pd! ated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   ! Az! -Zahir Hakim , WR STL - God Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Oper Error Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-Gato Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Kar Bombs Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - God Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks  , TE GB - BCWD's Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Starboy Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.   More Upda! te!

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Dynegy Sets Commissioning of 1,010 MW of
New ECAR Region Power for 2nd Quarter 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 18, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Dynegy Incorporated (NYSE:DYN) (Houston) is underway
with the construction of two new power plants that will bring 1,010
mega-watts (MW) into service during the 2nd quarter of 2002 in the
ECAR (East Central Area Reliability) region.
	   The larger of the two projects, the $150 million, 680MW
Renaissance Power Plant, will be located in Carson City, Mich., on a
30-acre track of land north of Highway 57 on property that was
originally developed by Decker Energy International back in June of
2000. The natural gas-fired plant will utilize four Westinghouse model
501F combustion turbines and will tie into Consumers Energy's
transmission system through a 2-mile interconnection line. Gas
connections will be provided by a 9.2-mile pipeline from Michigan
Consolidated Gas Company.
	   The second project, Foothills Generation Station, is adjacent to
Dynegy's 500MW Riverside Generation, located near Louisa, Ky., that
began commercial operation in June 2001. This $100 million natural
gas-fired simple-cycle peaking plant consists of two Siemens
Westinghouse 501F combustion turbines and brings an additional 330MW
to the grid. American Electric Power will provide transmission
interconnects and fuel will be provided by Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company.
	   When Renaissance and Foothills come online along with Riverside,
Dynegy will have added approximately 1,510MW to the ECAR region by 2nd
Quarter 2002. Steve Bergstrom, president and chief operating officer
of Dynegy added, ""These power projects will contribute significantly
to the financial base of the communities, providing for expanded
community services that will directly or indirectly benefit local
residents. These projects also will contribute to the county's goal of
continued growth and development, as well as provide much needed
capacity to help enhance electric service reliability in the areas.""
	   Dynegy is a leading provider of energy and communications
solutions to customers in North America, the United Kingdom and
Continental Europe. Their position extends across the entire
convergence value chain, including power generation and wholesale and
direct commercial and industrial marketing and trading of power,
natural gas and coal. They are also involved in the transportation,
gathering and processing of natural gas liquids and the transmission
and distribution of electricity and natural gas to retail consumers.

"Replacement for ""Big Deal""","Gentlemen, 
I have created a new file to track our physical P&L and power flows.  I have tried to simplify the data
entry, by coloring only the cells that require an input.  If the cell is white than it is a formula and no
data entry is required.  Also, the file now accurately captures reservation charges, and flowed vs. 
reserved megawatts.

I created 2 copies of the file.  One for Peter, Joe, and Willis.  And the other for the night crew.

Peter, Joe, Willis -

"Conflict of Interest Policy Mailing to Vendors","
Attached is a copy of a sample letter which we are sending to selected vendors of Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries as an additional step toward implementing our commitment to conduct our business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business Ethics Policy.

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to an Enron work environment of which we can all be proud.

******************************************************************************************************************************

SAMPLE 
November ____, 2001
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
<<Headquarter_Name>>
<<Street>>
<<City>><<State>><<Zip>>
<<Country>>
Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. (""Enron"") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

Subject:	FW: pjm-emc EMC MEETING NOTICE

See the notice below regarding the next PJM Energy Market Committee (EMC) meeting on Nov 8. I will be on jury duty that day and will be unable to cover the meeting.  The  EMC is the most active (and activist) committee in PJM where most issues and changes to market rules and the tariff are proposed and debated (an agenda has yet to be issued).  I would suggest that we provide coverage of this meeting either in person or conference call.  If you are interested in attending or participating via conference call let me know.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  On Wednesday, we'll continue our live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day.   Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on energy legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the anthrax scare in Washington.  Congressional office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday.   The Washington bureau will also cover Wednesday's FERC meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations.  Peter says new proposals for developing RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the FERC's agenda.   Dyonyx CEO Fred Pratt will talk with the Houston bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. Dyonyx is a privately held information technology and management-consulting firm.  Join us for the Pratt interview from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.   We'll also get a Texas PUC update on Wednesday.  ENL's Gale Smith says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Texas PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Texas.  Be sure to catch all this from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   California Power Authority Chairman S. David Freeman gives a reflective look back at the state's energy crunch from the West Coast bureau Wednesday.  Freeman also talks about how the state plans to stay out of the headlines in the future.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station will go ahead with plans to set off its 49 sirens on Wednesday to make sure warning systems are operational.  Kym says they will continue the test despite their concerns of a jittery public in light of recent terrorist attacks.   Video Library Update: If you happened to miss it, check out ENL's interview with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).  Sen. Bingaman discussed the status of energy legislation in the Senate and the anthrax threat in Washington.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel"," 
-----Original Message-----

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give testimony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week.  What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energy market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.    

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Schmuel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Carol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works.  

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not physical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissioner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could work together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it's okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premise, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or flowgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not agreed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstances change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on which instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs being allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front.  

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

He is expected to play against Detroit.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 10/29/01 Cleeland (ankle) should be able to play in the Saints' next game. His current status is day to day.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perri! to! -style Updated 10/29/01 According to published reports, Dunn (hamstring) may return to practice later this week. But don't be surprised if his workload may be lessened a bit after Mike Alstott's performance against Minnesota.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Tacos Updated 10/29/01 Davis was inactive for Sunday's game, although he claimed he felt healthy enough to play. According to the Denver Post, there is no clear indication of when the Broncos will use Davis again. ""He never practiced last week with the first team,"" Mike Shanahan said.  Ryan L! ea!   , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Leaf was the No. 2 QB vs. Arizona and did not play on Sunday. As of now, it is not clear who will start for the Cowboys at New York. Clint Stoerner may have played well enough to get the call again next week.  Jim Miller , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Miller (hip) will be further evaluated on Monday. According to some published reports, he should be available for Chicago's next game.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - God Updated 10/29/01 Jo! hn! son injured his right foot in Sunday's game at San Diego. The injury is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hurt his elbow and shoulder.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/29/01 Pittman suffered a concussion in Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to day.  James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 10/29/01 Stewart was inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at RB for the Lions.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action. ! Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to pr! ef! er his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - G money Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - God Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consi! de! ring the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matt! er! what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdo! wn! Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Construction of Mexico's First Privately
Owned Ethylene Complex Hinges On Availability of Feedstock, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 26, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc; Houston).
Corporacion Grupo Serbo (Mexico City) first announced its intent to
construct an estimated $3 billion ethylene and derivatives complex in
Altamira, Tamaulipas earlier this year. Serbo's owner, Sergio Bolanos
Quesada, seeking partners to round out his 20% interest in the
complex, made the announcement shortly after it was revealed that
Serbo was purchasing the beleaguered engineering and construction
firm, Bufete Industrial (Mexico City). From the start, Serbo
understood that Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the state run oil and gas
monopoly, would provide 71,000 barrels per day of naphtha feedstock
for the proposed 975,000 metric ton per year ethylene cracker.
	   Pemex has been slow to sign the 25-year contract sought by Serbo
for the complex it hopes to complete by late 2005. A need to insure
feedstock supply could possibly delay the anticipated early 2002
groundbreaking of the 10-unit complex, which will include propylene,
butadiene, polypropylene and other downstream products, as well as its
own cogeneration unit for electricity and steam. Serbo also has plans
to construct a ""city"" adjoining the complex, featuring homes, schools,
churches, and hospitals, among many other features over and above
those found in more traditional ""company towns.""
	   Serbo and its partners hope to sell 95% of the complex's output on
the domestic market, with an estimated 50% going to other
petrochemical companies in Altamira. The heavily industrialized
Altamira is home to plants owned by BASF, Shell, and other chemical
majors. Serbo would have to import its naphtha feedstock if Pemex
fails to comply with their preliminary agreement, as other naphtha
sources are simply not available domestically.
	   ""With this stall, Pemex is hurting itself and quite possibly the
future of additional private petrochemical investment in Mexico,""
according to Annette Kreuger, chemical industry specialist with
Industrialinfo.com. ""With Mexico's President Vicente Fox making recent
speeches that private investment is the hope for Mexico's
petrochemical future, it doesn't bode well when a state run company is
dragging its feet over its part in a $3 billion investment -- an
investment that not only increases Mexico's protection against an
anticipated surge in foreign petrochemical imports over the next few
years but also offers an increased quality of life for an estimated
2,700 future employees.""

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Dredging Angolan Diamonds Beats Rain
Season Hazard, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--October 24, 2001--The following is an advisory by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc., Houston,
Texas). When licensing and share details of the Canadian company
SouthernEra have been finalized between the Angolan government and the
mining partners by March 2002, work will be able to proceed on the
Camafuca diamond project which has a diamond bearing kimberlite pipe
with a surface area of 167 hectares. Time and the rainy season are
crucial factors in the venture as the exposed part of the pipe can
initially be exploited by bulk-sampling whereas when the rainy season
hits the 80m wide Chicapa river floods over the area.
	   SouthernEra will use barge mounted dredges fitted with cutting
heads to recover the 23.2m carats worth $2.3 billion. This innovative
technique surmounts the natural obstacles, which have hitherto
prevented the exploitation of the pipe. The Israeli company Welox is
providing funding up to $20 million and will hold 33% of the joint
venture. Endiama, the Angolan government diamond corporation, will
hold 20%. SML, which is a combination of the Portuguese SPE and
Endiama, will take 15% and SouthernEra 32%.

during the course of the winter.""  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to ""keep the lights on"" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will be live from the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The focal theme this year is ""Energy markets: The challenges of the new millennium.""  Catch live reports from the first day of the 18th World Energy Congress on Monday.   Congress returns to Washington Monday amid continuing concern over the anthrax threat on Capitol Hill.  Both the House and Senate are expected to resume their normal schedule, which includes some action on energy.  There are hearings scheduled on the Price Anderson Act, reducing vehicle fuel consumption and MTBE.  The main action, however, will be behind the scenes in the Senate where Republicans and Democrats still differ on whether there's time to consider a comprehensive energy bill this year.  We'll bring you more details next week.    A summit on energy efficiency is also taking place next week from Washington.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D)-New Mexico and Representative  Ed Markey (D)-Massachusetts will be among the speakers at the event. We'll have all the details from the summit next week.   Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us a report Monday on Texas wind power projects.  Kim says federal and state laws helped get the idea off the ground, and now demand for wind power is allowing the market to do very well.  Kim will have all the details of wind generation success in Texas on Monday.      The Houston bureau will also have a report on how refiners will keep gasoline inventories well supplied once MTBE is phased out. Right now, MTBE makes up 10 percent of the U.S. gasoline pool.  Once the blending component is banned, refiners will look to isooctane to help supplement gasoline supplies.  Jacobs Consultancy's Dan Foley will talk about the role of isooctane on Monday.   Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz tells West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas, California's energy supply crisis is understandable, but the financial crisis is not.  Kym also talks one-on-one with former California Governor Pete Wilson.  He gives a reflective look into what went wrong with the state's deregulation plan and what the state needs to do to recover.   With earnings expected out October 31st, Calpine Corporation CEO Peter Cartwright will talk about his company's growth this quarter compared to this time last year.  He also reacts to word the state may attempt to renegotiate long-term power contracts.  We'll bring you details from the West Coast bureau on Monday.   Get the streamers and balloons ready - Energy News Live is turning one.  You'll want to be sure to log on Tuesday, October 23rd, because in celebration of ENL's one-year anniversary we've scheduled a  star-studded cast of energy industry guests.  Here's a little preview:   Former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, Ph.D.  Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King  FirstCall Director of Research Chuck Hill  Platts Global Director of Oil John Kingston  Petroleum Argus, Inc. President Dan Massey  American Association of Petroleum Geologists Director Rick Fritz   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Did you watch the same game I saw?  Apparently not.  The Horns looked awesome.  Alot better than that team you root for.  You wish you went to UT, don't you?!

Did you have a good time last night?  Find a cute little Texas girl to fall in love with?  There are plenty of them in Austin.  If I hear no stories, I know you had a really good time.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. !  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starboy Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.    Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - El-Gato Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01  Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01! Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on ! Su! nday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsi! st! ent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone on! ce! again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Star! bo! y Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

Dear all,

This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not throw a touchdown pass for the f! ir! st time this season, however, and has been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear who will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Batch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go, but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears secondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  ! Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Carter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for Dallas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit. Keep an eye on his progress during practice this week before you make a final decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Graham suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is day to day.  Jason Brookins  , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/26/01 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore will elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - G money Updated 11/26/01 Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - God Updated 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day to! d! ay.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 1! 1/! 25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - God Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his o! wn! ers would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Tacos Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  ! Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - God Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) American Electric Power and Dow Chemical
Await Final Permit for Cogen Unit, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston,
Texas). American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) (Columbus, Ohio) and
development partner The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE:DOW) (Midland, MI)
are expecting final permit approval in November for the construction
of a 900 mega-watt (MW) $325 million cogeneration unit to be
constructed at Dow's Plaquemine chemical complex in Louisiana.
	   AEP plans to begin construction during December of 2001 utilizing
their subsidiary AEP Pro Serv, Incorporated (Columbus, OH) for
engineering design on the project that is scheduled to take 22 months
to complete. A short list of two general contractors has also been
identified.
	   The natural gas-fired unit will be configured with four General
Electric 7FA combustion turbines and a nominal 200MW Alsthom stream
turbine with a heat recovery steam generator to produce electricity
and process steam for the Dow complex. A 20-year power sales agreement
is also in place with Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc. a subsidiary of
Belgian company Tractebel S.A.
	   Paul Addis, executive vice president for AEP adds, ""This new
facility will bring generating capacity to Louisiana using
environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient technology, while at the
same time allowing Dow to achieve greater energy efficiency in its
core business.""
	   American Electric Power is a multinational energy company based in
Columbus, Ohio. AEP owns and operates more than 38,000 megawatts of
generating capacity, making it one of America's largest generators of
electricity. The company is also a leading wholesale energy marketer
and trader, ranking second in the U.S. in electricity volume.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone, 

	This weekend saw more tough games to pick, both in college and the pros. Among the games missed by many people were, in college games, Michigan/Michigan St.; Stanford/Washington; UCLA/Washington St.; Illinois/Purdue; and Texas A&M/TexasTech. 
In the pros, Baltimore/Pittsburgh was not a good game for most people, Seattle/Washington was a bad one and NY/Jets/New Orleans was missed by most people, while Kansas City/San Diego was not correctly picked by anyone. 

	We had 31 entries this week, making the pot $93. Currently in the lead is Robert Vargas, with only 6 games missed. No one else had 6 wrong, while Carter Ellis was the only one with 7 wrong. Robert picked Denver tonight, while Carter picked Oakland. Therefore, if Denver wins, Robert will win outright; if Oakland wins, then it will come down to the total points scored. Robert chose 49, while Carter choose 30. Therefore, if Oakland wins and there is 40 or more points, then Robert will win, 39 or less with Oakland, then Carter will win. Here are the number of games each person missed this week.

He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He wo! n'! t make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Hurricanes Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is un! cl! ear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't star! t ! Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 11/18/01! Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a tou! ch! down. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterb! ac! ks in the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good backup RB right now.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01!  Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch.

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take 
him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick 
him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what you 
think?  My sister will probably also come (just for the day).  As soon as I 
find out I'll let you know. 
Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for the

"results of the football pool","Hello everyone,

	We already have a winner in this week's football pool. Rudy Acevedo only missed 5 games and picked Minnesota in tonight's game, while the other people who missed 6 games, all picked Minnesota as well tonight. There were 21 people who played this week, making the prize $63. 

	Among the games widely missed were: in college, mainly just the Alabama/Auburn game; in the pros, Atlanta/Green Bay; NY Jets/Miami; Cleveland/Baltimore; Washington/Denver and Chicago/Tampa Bay. 

	With the short week this week, there will not be a pool this coming weekend. We will resume next week. Here are the amount of games missed by each person who played this week.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America
Nears Completion of $800 Million Expansion in Princeton, Indiana, in
an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (Erlanger,
KY), a division of Toyota Motor Corporation (Aichi Prefecture, Japan)
(NYSE:TM) is nearing completion of an $800 million expansion at its
Princeton, Indiana assembly plant. Located on 1,160 acres, the
original plant was built in 1998 and is the sole manufacturer of the
new Tundra full-size pickup truck. The Tundra is Toyota's first entry
into the full-size truck market and the Princeton plant produced
56,176 Tundras in 1999 for U.S. and Canadian export markets.
	   Construction started in the spring of 2001 to expand the original
2 million square foot facility by adding 1.8 million square feet. The
investment of $800 million at this facility will raise the annual
production capacity of Tundras and Sequoias from 120,000 units to
200,000 units. The facility houses operations in stamping, body
welding, painting, plastics and assembly of the Tundra pickup truck,
Sequoia full-size sport utility vehicle, and the Sienna minivan, which
is scheduled to start production in 2003. Once this expansion is
complete, Toyota's investment at Princeton, Indiana will total $2
billion, with a capacity of 300,000 units and employment expectancy of
4,300 people. Employment is currently 2,460 at this facility.
	   Toyota employs more than 30,000 people in North America, including
approximately 20,000 at its manufacturing plants in California,
Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, West Virginia, and Ontario and British
Columbia in Canada. Once the Indiana-built Sequoias debut, Toyota will
produce eight vehicles in North America; including the Avalon, Camry,
Camry Solara, Corolla, Sequoia, Sienna, Tacoma and Tundra.

Subject:	FW: FERC Meeting on November 7

TJ and Claude-please send to your groups. thanks.

 

FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.  The generic docket ""Electricity Market Design and Structure,"" which is the docket FERC is using for its ""RTO Week"" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.  However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Harley-Davidson Roars into the New
Millennium, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Automotive Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). You can hear them approaching from hundreds of yards
away. That guttural, rumbling, roar can only denote one thing, a
Harley is near. Harley-Davidson Motor Company (Milwaukee, Wi.)
(NYSE:HDI) has been an institution in the motorcycle industry since
1903 when William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson first painted their
names on the gas tank of the first Harley-Davidson (H-D) Motorcycle.
Originally designed to be a racing bike, the H-D bike won its first
race in 1905 and never looked back.
	   As the most popular motorcycle in America, H-D is constantly
growing in an effort to keep pace with ever-increasing demand, and to
keep ahead of the research curve on new product development. The new
millennium appears to bode well for H-D as they have announced plans
to spend approximately $250 million on capital projects in 2001 alone.
This includes grassroot plants in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and
will position H-D to maintain its lead in the U.S. motorcycle
industry. In addition to planning brand new facilities, H-D is also
expanding and upgrading their existing plants and research centers. In
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, H-D is planning a 75,000 square foot (sqft)
office building addition and a 65,000 sqft plant expansion.
	   These expansions will enable H-D to maintain 800 jobs and create
393 new positions, something the Governor of the state is fully
behind. ""The company is expanding and upgrading equipment at two of
its Wisconsin facilities,"" says Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum.
""The quality of its products has helped raise Wisconsin's viability
around the world."" H-D shipped 200,000 motorcycles for the first time
in company history last year. H-D's internal company goals had
initially called for reaching that sales milestone by 2003, the year
they celebrate their first century of business.
	   Harley-Davidson, Incorporated is the largest U.S.-based motorcycle
manufacturer, and produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a
complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel, and general
merchandise.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) TVA Starts Construction of the Nation's
First Energy Storage Plant, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston, Texas). The Tennessee Valley Authority (NYSE:TVB)(NYSE:TVC)
recently started construction of the nation's first large scale power
storage facility at a two acre site off of Highway 373 just east of
the Air Force Base near Columbus, MS. Construction of the $25 million
facility is expected to take 18-24 months to complete, creating
roughly 60 jobs before the project is finished in 2003. ""This
innovative energy-storage plant is designed to improve power
reliability and customer service, have limited environmental impact
and contribute to economic growth for consumers in Mississippi and
throughout the Tennessee Valley,"" says TVA Chairman Glenn McCullough
Jr. ""TVA continues to set the pace for energy production and
demonstrate its role as a national leader in the use of cutting-edge,
21st-Century technologies.""
	   The plant was designed by Regenesys Technologies Limited, part of
Innogy plc (UK) and utilizes regenerative fuel cell technology. During
periods of low electrical demand the cells are charged with
electricity generated at other locations. The stored energy is then
released during times of demand. The power storage facility is
designed to store up to 120 megawatt-hours of energy and will be
capable of providing power to 7,500 homes for up to 10 hours. ""This
will be the first use of the Regenesys technology in the United
States,"" said Regenesys Technology Chief Executive Officer Andrew
Duff. Rengenesys and Innogy are currently building a similar plant in
the United Kingdom scheduled for completion in 2002.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Construction Begins On $450 Million
Montreal Purified Terephthalic Acid Plant, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 29, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). Interquisa Canada, a Spanish-Canadian joint
venture between Compania Espagnola de Petroleos' (Cepsa) chemical
division Interquisa (San Roque, Spain) and Societe Generale de
Financement's (SGF-Montreal, Quebec) subsidiary SGF Chemie has started
construction of a new Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) plant in
Montreal, Quebec. The new plant will have an initial capacity slated
at 500,000 metric tons per year and will directly employ approximately
140 people. Interquisa, the majority partner with a 51% interest and a
major European PTA producer, provided the technology for the plant.
	   PTA is the main raw material for the production of polyester
fiber, and is also used in tire cord, magnetic tape, plastic film, and
PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) bottles. Polyesters based on PTA are
used everyday in the packaging products of soft drinks,
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, household and other products.
	   SNC-Dragados Industrial (Montreal, Quebec) is the construction
manager for the plant, which is expected to be in operation by late
2002. The paraxylene feedstock required for the production of PTA will
be provided from another SGF joint venture formed with Coastal
Petrochimie, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (Houston, Texas).
Coastal's 350,000 metric tons per year paraxylene unit, which was
shuttered in 1998, will be reopened at a cost of $135 million.
	   Interquisa, founded in 1972, is a subsidiary of Compania Espanola
de Petroleos (CEPSA), which is the second largest oil company in Spain
commanding 25% of the Spanish oil market. Interquisa, the only PTA
producer in Spain, also produces Dimethyl Terephthalate (DMT) and
Purified Isophthalic Acid (PIPA) at their plant in San Roque, Spain.
	   The Societe Generale de Financement (SGF) provides businesses with
development capital. SGF invests in partnerships, while assuming its
share of risk, by taking part in the management of every project it
supports. With a focus on Quebec's long-term economic development, SGF
chooses projects from natural resources to high technology and has an
investment potential of $2 billion over a five-year period.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Canada's Northwest Territories Sponsors
New Green Energy Power Development, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors & Environmental Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). Canada's Northwest Territories provincial
government has been looking at the region's major river systems as a
source for green or environmentally friendly hydroelectric power.
Studies indicate that the six river systems in the province could
produce 11,630 mega-watts (MW) of power. Developing hydroelectric
power of this magnitude would require about $16.6 billion for new
generation construction alone, with several billion more needed for
power transmission line and infrastructure construction.
	   The largest river system in the province, the Mackenzie River
system, has the greatest potential for future development. It is
estimated that the river system has the capacity to support the bulk
of studied new hydroelectric generation construction at around $14
billion.
	   Utilization of green power instead of fossil fuels for new power
plants could reduce future CO2 emissions in Canada by approximately
50% and supports the provinces' push for greenhouse gas emission
reductions. In addition, communities in the region would be able to
share over $428 million of power sales related revenues annually from
power companies locating in the area. These power projects can also
stimulate industrial growth by attracting new support businesses to
the area.

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) From Russia With South African and
Australian Associates, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Norilsk, the Russian nickel mining corporation,
is taking its first step out of the home territories of the former
Soviet Union with its participation in the Nakety nickel project in
New Caledonia. The project is at present estimated to be worth in
excess of $500 million. Assisting in the generation of the project,
which was initiated by the Australian/Canadian company Argosy, is the
South African project development and process engineering group
Bateman Project Holdings who have worked with both of the other
project associates on previous ventures.
	   The relationship with Norilsk could grow for Bateman as the
Russians are said to be interested in base metal projects in Africa
and South Africa. The South African company has developed technologies
and management and marketing techniques to apply to the commercial
exploitation of a range of raw mineral mining projects in developing
countries. It is currently completing a $160 million gas compressor
plant in Turkmenistan, which is being followed by a similar plant in
Uzbekistan. Phosphates projects in the Middle East and Peru are also
under consideration. In Africa, it has the Skorpion zinc-mine
concentrator, refinery and smelter in Namibia, the SA Chrome project
in South Africa and diamond, cobalt and copper projects in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as the Corridor Sands project
in Mozambique.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) DOE's Vision 21 Program Sets Goal of
Zero Emission Power Plant of the Future, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 20, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston). The energy plant of the future is being developed through a
series of research projects funded jointly between the DOE (Department
of Energy) fossil energy division and private sector partners. The
Vision 21 Program seeks to develop an ultra-clean, virtually
emission-free power plant ready for commercial generation by 2015. The
program sponsors emerging state-of-the-art technologies, which will be
combined in a modular plant configuration to utilize multiple fuels
(coal, natural gas, biomass, petroleum coke, and municipal waste) and
produce electricity along with other liquid fuels and/or chemicals.
The program sets performance targets of greater than 60% fuel to
energy efficiency for coal systems and greater than 75% fuel to energy
efficiency for gas.
	   Speaking at the recent annual meeting of the Western Coal
Transportation Association, Fred Palmer, vice president of legal and
external affairs for Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU) (St. Louis), said that
Peabody Energy is fully supporting and is an active partner in the
Department of Energy's Vision 21 Program. The goal of this innovative
program is to build the power plant of the future with essentially
zero emissions. Mr. Palmer went on to mention an ambitious coal
industry program to achieve a zero emission coal-fired power plant in
operation by 2025.
	   This summer the DOE announced the winners of the third and final
round of project funding. So far the DOE has promised $22 million to
be spent over three years on the twelve projects selected. These
projects focus on developing specific modular components of the plant
and involve fuel cell technologies, coal gasification, high strength
materials, hydrogen separation, and computer systems to name a few.

But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - God Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Beegs Boys Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in plac! e ! of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - G money Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Starboy Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Kar Bombs Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week! i! f the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Kar Bombs Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Update! d ! 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - BCWD's Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end no! w ! that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Oper Error Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Tacos Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 Canidate wi! ll! likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hurricanes Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productiv! e ! of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL! -! Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/28/01 ! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - G money Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free Ag! en! t Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - God Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no ma! tt! er what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touch! do! wn Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - God Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some w! or! k at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  M! arty Booker , WR CHI - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/18/01Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Banks was carted ! of! f the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good backup RB rig! ht! now.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01 Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Hurricanes Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB.   James Jackson , RB CLE - God Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - God Updated 11/18/01 Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01  The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

 	 	    Dear Joe,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   On Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Washington on the final day of the FERC's weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations.  Participants have told our bureau the workshop has been productive and tomorrow we'll find out how the meetings might impact FERC's implementation of RTOs.  Former FERC Commissioner Don Santa will give us his thoughts during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast on where RTOs stand now.   We'll also get more reaction to the nomination of Joe Kelliher to fill the open seat at the FERC.  Gay Friedmann of the INGAA will give us her thoughts on Kelliher's nomination during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Finally from Washington on Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Congress on energy legislation.  The anthrax scare has impacted an already crowded Congressional calendar and there's mixed opinion in the Senate on whether lawmakers there will vote on a comprehensive energy bill this year.     ENL's Gale Smith reports, a major energy company is launching a  one-of-a-kind Web site to buy fuel.  The unique idea behind this is that customers helped develop the site.  Motiva Vice President of Commercial Marketing and Distribution Ralph Grimmer talks about the site from the Houston bureau on Friday.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on Sakonnet Technology on Friday.  Sakonnet was started by a handful of former employees from JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch and has found success by being able to offer the same level of support as more established investment banks - for less money.  Join us tomorrow from the Houston bureau for all the details on Sakonnet.      From the West Coast bureau, ENL's Kym McNicholas says we'll have word on Friday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's press conference and remarks from his keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's electricity crisis.       California Governor Gray Davis is expected to announce his administration's strategy to attempt renegotiation of the long-term power contracts the state signed between January and September of this year with electricity providers.  Log on for these stories and more from the West Coast bureau.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.

Postcard from Faizabad


Oct 15th 2001 | FAIZABAD 
From The Economist Cities Guide

 
ANYONE planning to visit Faizabad, provisional capital of the northern
(non-Taliban) part of Afghanistan, had better be well prepared. Assuming
that you want to visit the main city in the poorest province of the
poorest country in Eurasia, here's what to do.

How to get there 

Faizabad is not served by scheduled transport of any form. The least
uncomfortable way of reaching it is by an elderly Soviet military plane
which makes an occasional run from Dushanbe, the capital of neighbouring
Tajikistan. The round trip is $300, although no return flights are
currently scheduled. If you are desperate to return, keep $900 handy in
cash. You may be able to persuade the pilot to drop you off at Dushanbe
when he flies his return leg, which is to a Russian military base in
Tajikistan where the plane is maintained.

For flight details, join the queue of journalists, chancers and
do-gooders clustered outside the Afghan embassy on Bakhtar Street,
Dushanbe. You will need a return Tajik visa, a letter from a western
organisation accrediting you, and a Tajik government pass (obtainable
from the Tajik ministry of foreign affairs). These formalities
(including an Afghan visa) take two or three days, after which you can
start haggling for a place on the plane. Your chance of getting one of
these places will depend on your importance, persistence, charm, and
good luck.

The only alternatives are: 

a) by land from Pakistan. This involves crossing a 4,700-metre-high pass
on a donkey, and is impossible in winter. The border is currently
closed, but porous for those with enough money; 

b) by land from Khoja Bahauddin, the military headquarters. This is a
bone-shaking ten-hour ride on very bad roads. To get to Khoja, you need
a helicopter. If you have friends at CNN, you may be able to get a place
on one of their flights. If not, join the queue at the Afghan embassy in
Dushanbe.

Arrival 

Faizabad airport is a desolate former Soviet military airstrip,
surrounded by a few ruined huts. There are no facilities of any kind.
You will be met by a jeep and taken to the so-called Club, which is a
guesthouse for visiting foreigners. There is another hotel, The Star,
for guests of the government.

Accommodation

If you are lucky you will be sleeping six or eight to a room at the
Club, on thin mattresses. If you are unlucky, you will be sleeping in
the corridor, or outside. Bring your own sleeping bag, preferably a very
warm one in case you are in the garden. Other things to remember include
a thin foam mattress, a mosquito net, a towel, soap, lavatory paper,
water and water-purifying equipment, satellite telephone, several
thousand dollars in small denomination bills and a flak jacket.

Booking ahead of time for the Club is impossible, but you may be able to
send a message via the Afghan embassy in Dushanbe.

Communications

Faizabad's phone system dates from before the second world war. There is
a publicly available satellite telephone at the telephone exchange in
the new town (open: daily, 8am-6pm), as well as a short-wave radio (in
the old town post office, near the police station in the bazaar main
square) that can be used for calling 15 other towns in the region,
including Dushanbe. 

Eating and drinking

The menu at the Club does not vary: bread, tea and curds for breakfast;
Plov (rice with meat), for lunch and dinner. You can buy supplementary
food in the bazaar. The carrots are delicious, as are the raisins and
dried apricots. The fiery local hot peppers may kill the local
intestinal parasites before they start trying to kill you.

Language

The locals speak Dari, a dialect of Persian. English is spoken very
little. However, everyone will ask you how you are and what is your
name, even if they don't understand the answer. 

Useful words & phrases

Man Mikheim = I would like...

Chai = tea

Teshekur = thanks

Berem! = Let's go

For about $30-50 a day you can have a translator. The best one, who has
studied English in Pakistan, is called Fawad. He can be contacted
through the hotel. 

Sanitary arrangements

There is no running water in the hotel, or indeed anywhere in Faizabad.
The standpipe water is piped from the mountain and has been tested for
potability by Oxfam. It is probably better to stick to tea, or the two
dozen bottles of water you have wisely brought with you.

Washing in the hotel can be done outside, from a cistern of fresh water,
which the bodyguards find highly amusing, or in the washroom inside the
hotel, which is less salubrious. You may be able to cadge a tin of warm
water for shaving.

There is no mains electricity supply. At the time of writing, the hotel
generator was running for about four or five hours in the evening. You
should use this opportunity to charge satellite phones, camera
batteries, laptops, or anything else. It is wise to bring an inverter
(available from hardware stores) with which you can convert electricity
from a car cigarette lighter to mains current.

Sightseeing

The most fascinating sights in Faizabad are in the bazaar. You can buy,
for example, a 1918-vintage Lee Enfield rifle, complete with 1942
ammunition, at the kiosk in the alley running down to the left of the
police station. There is an antique shop, half way up the main street in
the bazaar on the right-hand side going away from the hotel, where you
can buy lapis lazuli jewellery and other local handicrafts. An Afghan
""petu"" (wrap) is a good investment against the cold, especially if you
have to sleep outside. There are also attractive hats (Pakols) but these
will lead to death or imprisonment if worn in the Taliban-controlled
parts of the country. 

Entertainment

Faizabad has the only television station in Afghanistan. It broadcasts
for three hours every evening. Sit in a tea-house in the bazaar and
drink in the atmosphere, or go the to the mosque. During Friday prayers,
you can hear the Burhanuddin Rabbani (who lives in Faizabad) speak. Mr
Rabbani is president of the internationally recognised government of
Afghanistan, which controls between a tenth and a fifth of the country. 

Expeditions

Leaving Faizabad is possible with a government-approved driver (check at
the hotel). You can go and see the lapis lazuli mine, which is about a
day's drive away, or visit the Pansjir valley, currently the scene of
desultory fighting. Ask at the hotel for details, and expect to pay
$100-300 per day for a jeep and driver, depending on the kind of car and
the danger of the expedition. 

Kill an hour

The nicest expedition is to cross the river at the bridge below the
Club, and then turn right, walking about 1km along the precipitous
parapet of the newly built fresh-water canal. You will then reach an
interesting forestry project (deforestation in Afghanistan is
terrifying) and a water wheel. Continue on and you are in the new town,
where you can hobnob with any remaining foreigners, or make a call from
the municipal satellite telephone. Then cross the river, and you will
arrive in the middle of the bazaar. Turn right, and head down through
the ford, up the hill, turn right at the petrol tankers (take care not
to be splashed as they decant petrol from the big cisterns into little
cans) and you will arrive back at the hotel. At a gentle pace, this
takes about 45 minutes. 

Social customs

Although women may work, and girls can go to school, the sexes are
strictly segregated in public. If you have made Afghan male friends, do
not expect them to introduce you to their womenfolk. Women visitors
should not smoke in public, and should dress as modestly as possible.
Such crumbs of western-style social-life as exist are among the handful
of intrepid foreigners still resident here. They all live and work in
the same street in the new town, easily identified by their
organisations' emblems (Red Cross, Medicins sans Fronti?res, etc). 

Currency

The local currency is the Afghani (northern version) which trades at
about 130,000 to the dollar. The largest denomination is 100,000. It is
better to change small amounts of money. As well as the US dollar,
Tajik, Iranian and Pakistani money is easy to change. There are no banks
(see article: Mullah moolah, October 4th 2001).

Medical care

Medicins sans Fronti?res has a hospital. Apart from that, you're on your
own.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a de! ce! nt Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 ! There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewh! at! of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito! -s! tyle Updated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyle Brady , TE JAC - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy ! Sm! ith  , WR JAC - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at running back.  M! arcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver. Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/01 Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be Clark.  More Updates  Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]God Player News  Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01 Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay, so avoid starting him if at all possible.   Troy Brown , Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Wesley Walls , Active TE Updated 11/21/01 Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable.   Qadry Ismail , Active WR Updated 11/21/01 Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.  Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.  Ricky Watters , Injured RB Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Terrell Owens , Active WR Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against Indianapolis.   Shaun Alexander , Active RB Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 11/18/01 Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB.  Stacey Mack , Reserve RB Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/18/01 Garcia had another huge game, posting 305 yards and three touchdowns against Carolina. He's been one of the top three Fantasy quarterbacks this season, and may even be more valuable than Peyton Manning at this point.   James Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place.   Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Mike Vanderjagt , Active K Updated 10/12/01 Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play against the Raiders.  Browns , Active DT Updated 09/23/01 The Browns allowed just 14 points during Sunday's game against Detroit, and racked up two sacks and seven interceptions in the process. Cleveland's defense is a tad underrated and has some Fantasy value in deeper leagues, but keep in mind that the high interception total was mainly due to an ineffective game by Ty Detmer.  Buccaneers , Reserve DT Updated 08/08/01 Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesday.   John Carney , Reserve K Updated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.

"Breakfast & Lunch - $5.00 ea","Starting tomorrow, 11/28/01 we will be included with the Gas Breakfast and Lunches.  However, there will be a cost of $5.00 each or $10.00 total when breakfast is provided.  They will have lunch everyday and breakfast only three days of the month, which will be during bid week.  

I will come around every morning and collect your money...I will then have to provide a list to the Gas people who will be checking your name off as you enter the breakfast/lunch line.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

REMEMBER...ONLY THOSE WHO GIVE THE $5.00 WILL BE EATING.

"Daily Update","
Here is an update on new developments that have occurred over the past few days.

New Board Member & Committee Elected

Today, the Enron Board of Directors elected William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas, to the Board.  Bill currently holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law and the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, where he teaches tort, products liability, jurisprudence, legal process, civil procedure and contracts.  He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1973.

Additionally, the Board established a Special Committee that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The Special Committee, to be chaired by Bill, comprises independent directors Frank Savage, CEO of Savage Holding LLC as chairman, Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bonanza, and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings, Inc.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.

The committee has retained William R. McLucas, a former head of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as its counsel.  Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice.

SEC Changes Inquiry to Investigation

We also reported today that the SEC has opened a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and were previously the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  This is not unusual and we welcome this investigation and are confident that this matter will finally be put to rest.

With so much publicity surrounding our company right now, I want to ask you to keep in mind that not all media reports are accurate or even based on factual information.  We are committed to communicating updates to you every day by voice mail, e-mail or both, so that you know the factual status of our company's situation.

We have created an Enron Updates Intranet site (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>) to keep you apprised of current events.  Please check back frequently for information and new developments.

I truly thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.

Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc; Houston) The
Immunex Corporation (Nasdaq:IMNX)(Seattle) is set to start
construction on a fourth manufacturing plant for their very profitable
arthritis therapy, Enbrel(R). Immunex enjoyed a third quarter 2001 net
income of approximately $40 million, an increase of 26% over the same
period last year. Immunex is working towards ensuring enough
manufacturing capacity to support an anticipated $5 to $6 billion in
Enbrel(R) sales over the next five years.
	   Dubbed the ""BioNext Project,"" the new facility is being engineered
by Kvaerner Process (Bridgewater, N.J.), with Turner Construction
(Dallas) handling construction management. The plant will house one of
the largest bioreactors used in the industry, estimated to be 20,000
liters in capacity. There will also be a centralized utility area
featuring water-for-injection (WFI), clean steam, and other central
utility services.
	   The project is adjacent to an existing facility that is currently
being retrofitted to produce Enbrel(R) in an agreement with
Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals (Saint Davids, Pa.), another division of
American Home Products Corporation (NYSE:AHP) (Madison, N.J.), which
has 41% ownership of Immunex. AHP has agreed to sell Immunex the
facility, which it purchased in 1999 specifically for the production
of Enbrel(R). The new plant is expected to employ 350 people once
construction is complete in 2005.
	   The Immunex Corporation was founded in 1981. The biopharmaceutical
company focuses on immune system science innovations, with Enbrel(R),
their rheumatoid arthritis therapy, adding heavily to their 2000
revenues of $861.8 million and a net income of $154.4 million.

engineering services and the construction division, J. A. Jones
Construction (Charlotte, N.C.), will construct the plant. Both

General Electric 7FA combustion turbines. A seven-year power sales
agreement has also been reached with Seminole Electric Cooperative
(Tampa, Fla.) to purchase a portion of the plant's electrical output.
The remainder of the power will be sold on the wholesale power market
to help meet the growing energy demand in Florida.
	   Constellation Energy Group is an integrated energy company, which
includes Constellation Power Source, Baltimore Gas and Electric, the
oldest utility in the country, and Constellation Nuclear. Formed in
1997, Constellation Power Source is a national merchant energy company

He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game.    Derrick Alexander  , WR KC - G money Updated 10/25/01   Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.     Dave Stachelski  , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards.     Michael Bennett  , RB MIN - BCWD's Updated 10/25/01   Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.     Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Kar Bombs Updated 10/25/01   Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.     Anthony Thomas  , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 10/25/01   Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report.     Kevin Swayne  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.     Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/25/01   Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.     Jason Brookins  , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 10/25/01   Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday.

Charlie Batch  , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals.     O.J. McDuffie  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury.     Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Kar Bombs Updated 10/25/01   Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 10/25/01   The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday.

Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times .

He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - God Upda! te! d 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - God Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jo! na! than Quinn  , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - God Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy ! Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - G money Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/! 20! /01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money  Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - God Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley.    Giants , DT NYG - Starboy Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post , cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver,! WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Ravens , DT BAL - BCWD's Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax scare on Capitol Hill on Thursday.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the decision to shut down the House of Representatives until Tuesday means at least one energy hearing on MTBE will be delayed.  The Senate remains in session and we hope to hear from Senators on Thursday about the situation.   Peter also says the bureau will have more reaction to the news that Department of Energy official Joe Kelliher has been picked by  President Bush to fill the vacant seat at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Kelliher's name has been on the top of the list for some time, and now the decision is official.   PSE?Director of Interregional Transmission Laura Manz will also join us from the Washington bureau on Thursday.  Manz has been participating in the FERC RTO workshop, and she'll give us her take on what might come out of the weeklong meetings.  Join us during the  10:00 a.m. ET newscast for the Manz interview.   IBM Chemical and Petroleum Industry Vice President of Marketing Craig Hodges is penciled in from the Houston bureau on Thursday. IBM has been selected by Shell Oil to create the prototype for a wireless gas station named the e-Station.  Catch Hodges during the  noon ET newscast.   West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas reports, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will be in California to announce a new public-private partnership regarding ""Path 15,"" a transmission bottleneck in California.  Abraham will also give a keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's Electricity.     Also from the West Coast bureau on Thursday, Kym talks with a Spokesperson about the Valero refinery's plan to build one power plant to operate the refinery and one to sell energy to off-site customers.  The California Energy Commission is expected to decide Wednesday night whether to grant the Valero refinery, located in Benicia, a permit to build.   From the NASDAQ in New York, NYMEX President Robert Collins will join us.  He'll discuss the status of NYMEX operations and trading following the September 11th attacks during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven a! s ! the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and ! co! uld miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times. ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Favre i! nj! ured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""  James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-Gato Updated 10/22/01 Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the Chicago Tribune reports that the Bears will continue to use an alternating system with him and ! Ja! mes Allen. ""We will continue to use them both,"" said offensive coordinator John Shoop. ""Anthony did a great job today, though."" As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.  Robert Wilson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be evaluated on a daily basis.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 10/22/01 Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception. Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/! 01!  Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards on Sunday.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status i! s ! day to day.  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - G money Updated 10/22/01 Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against Detroit.  J.R. Redmond , RB NE - G money Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 1! 0/! 22/01 Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week;s game is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/22/01 Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the Baltimore Sun, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a daily basis.  ! Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength, but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on November 4.    Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Oper Error Updated 10/22/01 Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - El-G! at! o Updated 10/22/01 Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season. Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.  Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/22/01 Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will be the primary receiver in his absence.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.  Ricky Williams , RB NO - R-Diddy Updated 10/22/01 Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21 carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the second half. ""We couldn't do anything in the second half,"" Williams said. ""We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made plays."" Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams this Sunday.    Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 10/22/01 Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for the rest of the season.   Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - God Updated 10/22/01 Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

	   HOUSTON--October 25, 2001--Researched by Industrialinfo.com
(Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston, Texas). Human Genome
Sciences, Inc. (Rockville, Md.) (NASDAQ:HGSI) has begun yet another
multimillion dollar project as part of an ambitious expansion program
in Rockville, Maryland. The new $100 million facility will be capable
of manufacturing commercial quantities of multiple drugs. Among other
products, HGSI expects to manufacture novel human hormones, used in
the treatment of various conditions ranging from skin ulcers to immune
system stimulation therapies and human antibody drugs for the
treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Gilbane Building Company
(Providence, Rhode Island) is the construction manager for the 360,000
square foot project, expected to be complete in 2003.
	   The 27-acre manufacturing campus currently houses a 127,000 square
foot manufacturing and process development facility to supply human
protein and antibodies for human clinical testing needs, while a
52,000 square foot quality assurance and quality control facility
provides production support.
	   In June of this year, HGSI broke ground on a $250 million research
& development and corporate campus at their 55 acre site located
approximately a mile away. This 418,871 square foot project is the
first phase of what will eventually be 1,030,000 square feet of R&D
laboratories and office space.
	   Human Genome Sciences, Inc., founded in 1992, is a pioneer in the
use of genomics, the study of all human genes, and the development of
new pharmaceutical products. They currently have five drugs in human
clinical trials and plan to be a global pharmaceutical company that
discovers, develops, manufactures and sells their own genomics-based
drugs.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"RE: Nepool SS","Joe,

I looked at the sheet, and I think it will be very helpful.  When I open it however, its giving me an error message - ""error updating database.""  and then it freezes.  Any ideas?  Is it something I can update each day from the file you gave me, or do you have it saved in a directory that I could just open?  I will be up on 31 at 10:30 , and can swing by your desk if you will have a minute.  Thanks for all your help!

Joe,

My name is Castlen Moore, and I work with Narsimha Misra on the EES desk.  Anna Santucci and I are managing the Nepool hedging for EES, and Narsimha mentioned you might have a spreadsheet that could be helpful to us.  He said he thought it was pulling info daily from the web on various fundamentals.  Give me a call or email me when you have a minute.  Anything on Nepool would be greatly appreciated by Anna and I.

Thanks!
Castlen

"RE: Are you ignoring me?","Yes we would watch the game!  And celebrate a longhorn victory!  Good luck finding a decent place to stay. How much do you want to spend?  The driskol hotel on 6th street is great and the 4 seasons is wonderful. Not quite as much $$ is the omni (downtown), hyatt on the lake or sherton. I think there's a marriott down town too. 

I'd say call me on sunday but I know your aversion to the phone. Have fun. Think of me once or twice.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - God Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck f! ro! m a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - God Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Kar Bombs U! pdated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Tacos Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him! . ! He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Hurricanes Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11! c! arries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Oper Error Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - G money Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starboy Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Kar Bombs Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boy! s ! Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - God Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Perrito-style Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - El-Gato Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ! ab! le to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - R-Diddy Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) RS Cogen LLC Targets August 2002
Completion Of 425MW Louisiana Cogen Project, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 29, 2001--The following is an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston, Texas). Construction is well underway on RS Cogen LLC's 425
mega-watt (MW) cogeneration unit adjacent to PPG's Lake Charles,
Louisiana chemical complex. The new power facility has an anticipated
completion date of August 2002 and the total project cost is estimated
at $240 million. RS Cogen LLC will own the plant and PPG will operate
it.
	   RS Cogen LLC is a 50/50 joint venture formed between PPG
Industries (NYSE:PPG) (Pittsburgh, PA) and Entergy Wholesale
Operations (The Woodlands, Texas), the unregulated power development
division of Entergy Corporation (NYSE:ETR) (New Orleans, LA).
	   Construction on the unit began in September 2000, with BVZ Power
Partners-Riverside, a Texas joint venture between Black & Veatch
(Kansas City, Missouri) and H.B. Zachary (San Antonio, Texas),
handling engineering, procurement, and construction. The natural
gas-fired, combined cycle power plant will have two
Siemens-Westinghouse 501F gas turbines, which provide higher kilowatt
output and lower environmental emissions than conventional systems.
Nooter Eriksen heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) and one Alstom
Power steam turbine generator will also be installed, along with a new
in-plant substation. Foxboro/Invensys will be supplying the I/A Series
control, data acquisition system and intelligent field
instrumentation.
	   PPG is expected to use 50% of the unit's electricity with the
remainder being sold to the wholesale power market. The plant will
also produce 250,000 pounds per hour of process steam for use at PPG,
and another 525,000 pounds per hour of process steam is to be
purchased by Lyondell Chemical Company (NYSE:LYO) (Houston, Texas).
	   PPG Industries was founded in 1883 and operates about 120 coating
material manufacturing and research & development facilities
worldwide. Sales in 2000 were $8.6 billion.
	   Entergy Wholesale Operations (EWO) has development and marketing
offices in London, Madrid, Milan and Sofia, Bulgaria. EWO has
approximately 10,000 megawatts of net capacity in operation,
development or under construction in North America and Western Europe.

market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Sands Running for South
African/Australian Mining Venture, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors & Environmental Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). The joint venture Ticor SA, between Kumba
Resources, the mining arm of Iscor the South Africa steel company, and
Australia's Ticor, has brought in the biggest Australian investment to
South Africa to date. Kumba has sold 40% of their heavy minerals sand
mining project near Richard Bay off the Kwazulu-Natal Indian Ocean
coast. Kumba banked approximately $40 million on the signing of the
deal and Ticor has the option to increase its stake to 80% when the
$130 million smelter is completed during the second phase of the
project at the end of 2003.
	   With this venture, Ticor could double the company's profit, as
titanium dioxide slag production would double to 100,000 tons per
annum. This would mean that Ticor could control 11% of global titanium
feedstock, making it the third largest producer in the world. The new
project would also make South Africa the world leader in titanium
oxide production. The 80 million tons of heavy mineral reserves at the
Hillendale mine will represent the first phase and will be undertaken
with hydraulic mining methods. Reserves are expected to last about ten
years but the operation could be extended to 22 years by starting new
mines at Fairbreeze to the south before the Hillendale deposit runs
out. The project is expected to attract $110 million of foreign
investment in the next two years and has established a community
development program in the area. Environmental protection and safety
have also received priority attention as have other sand mining
projects in the area.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  It's been one year since ENL began broadcasting - log on Tuesday and join the Energy News Live celebration.  We've scheduled a full day of coverage and special guests to commemorate our anniversary.   At the top of the list is our continuing live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us an interview with European Union Energy Commissioner Loyola De Palacio.  Join us on Tuesday as De Palacio discusses the reliability of energy supplies for Europe.   The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax situation and how it's impacting Congress.  At noon ET Tuesday, the bureau is expected to talk with Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman about the chance the Senate will consider energy legislation before Congress adjourns for the year.   Also from the Washington bureau on Tuesday, Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King will give us his thoughts on where energy legislation stands in Congress.  King will drop by during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Former FERC Chairman James Hoecker will also speak with us from Washington on Tuesday.  Hoecker will discuss the newest FERC nominee, Joe Kelliher, and what the Commission accomplished with its recently concluded RTO week during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.   The Houston bureau also has some great guests scheduled on Tuesday. Petroleum Argus, Inc. President Dan Massey will join us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast.  He'll discuss the crisis in risk management over the last year.   We'll also hear from Merrill Lynch Lead Energy Analyst Donato Eassey.  He'll drop by the Houston bureau to discuss the difficulties of this year, and where the energy industry goes from here.  Eassey is penciled in during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.      ENL's Kym McNicholas will have more on the California Department of Water Resources from the West Coast bureau on Tuesday.  The CDWR is holding a workshop in Sacramento to explain new revenue requirements and how the factors involved will bring down costs.   Kym says we'll also have more from former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and his thoughts on deregulation.  We'll have details from these stories and more on Tuesday from the West Coast bureau.   From Columbus, Ohio, AEP Spokesperson Pat Hemlepp will discuss AEP's earnings report due out Tuesday.  Hemlepp will also bring us an update on changes at AEP's payment processing center in the wake of the anthrax scares, and the importance of electronic payments, during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc., Houston,
Texas). BHP Billiton Limited (Melbourne Australia) (NYSE:BHP) has
pledged $620 million in energy sector developments in Algeria. The
Ohanet gas project will require an investment of $430 million form BHP
Billiton. BHP Billiton holds a 45% interest in the project with
Australia based Woodside Petroleum holding 15% and Algerian state oil
company Sonatrach and other partners the balance. The total investment
in the Ohanet gas project will be $1 billion. Reserve estimates are

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  The Department of Energy is hosting a conference on Clean Coal Technology on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future.  U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is among those scheduled to speak.   Look for energy legislation to move to the forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break.  Republicans in the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the chances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the year.   The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us coverage.   If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drastically increase production of ethanol.  On Monday, the Houston bureau's  Gale Smith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of making ethanol.  We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE.   A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers.  The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on Monday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is meeting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Resource Investment Plan.  The plan is due to the legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will hear a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Metcalf Energy Center.  After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker.    Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday.  He'll give us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the real problem behind Enron.  We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director  Mark Easterbrook is joining us.  Easterbrook will talk about the performance and outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs.  Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule for next week.  ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving market holiday.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Fate of Enron's Forest Products Group Up
in the Air, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston) Energy giant Enron Corporation (NYSE:ENE) (Houston), also the
seventh largest newsprint producer in North America, recently agreed
to be taken over by energy rival Dynegy Incorporated (NYSE:DYN)
(Houston). Dynegy has given the forest products group, which falls
under Enron's Wholesale Services business segment, an ""under review""
status in determining which businesses are core or non-core. Whether
Dynegy sheds or retains its papermaking assets may not be known before
the summer of 2002, when the transaction is expected to close. The
forest products group consists of a mill on the east coast and two in
eastern Canada, which will require an infusion of capital for
improvements.
	   Last year, Enron Industrial Markets purchased Garden State Paper
from Media General, a communications company, for roughly $72 million.
Located in Garfield, N.J., the mill employs 290 people and has a
capacity of 240,000 short tons a year of newsprint.
	   Earlier this year, Enron acquired Daishowa Forest Products Limited
to gain ownership of its newsprint mill and related assets in Quebec
City, Quebec. The former Daishowa Forest mill, now called Papiers
Stadacona is integrated with a Thermo-Mechanical Pulp (TMP) mill that
feeds four paper machines and employs over 1,000 employees. The mill
has studied the addition of a new de-inking plant, a bio-mass boiler,
and modernizations to the four paper machines.
	   NLK Consultants and Enron share ownership in the Papier Masson
mill in Masson-Angers, Quebec. The single machine mill employs over
300 workers and produces approximately 600 metric tons a day of
recycled content newsprint.
	   Upon completion of the merger, the new Dynegy is expected to have
revenues exceeding $200 billion and $90 billion in assets.
	   Dynegy is one of the world's premier energy merchants. Through its
global energy delivery network and marketing, trading and risk
management capabilities, Dynegy provides innovative solutions to
customers in North America and the United Kingdom and Continental

 	 	    Dear Joe,  Congress is out of town, but we've still got plenty of energy news from Washington.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets on Tuesday.  One of the issues on the FERC's agenda is a complaint filed against the California Independent System Operator.

We'll bring you the latest from the FERC on Tuesday.    ENL's Washington bureau will also cover the release of the North American Electric Reliability Council's Winter Assessment on Tuesday.

The event focuses on the latest in clean coal innovation and the prospects for coal-fired generation in the U.S.   Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports, many companies feel wild price swings could be eliminated with more accurate weather predictions.  On Tuesday, Kim talks with Reliant Energy about steps that can be taken to minimize weather risks.   Ivanhoe Energy Vice President of Investor Relations John MacDonald talks with our Houston bureau about plans his company has for Gas-to-Liquids production.  This type of motor fuel is odorless and emissions-free.  We'll have more from MacDonald on Tuesday.   From the NASDAQ on Tuesday, ESAI Power and Gas Services Director Edward Kraples will join us.  During the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast, he'll talk about the amount of investment needed to keep Northwest power prices from escalating.

He has been sidelined for over a month with a fractured collarbone. Don't expect him to be too productive. He will only be used in multiple-receiver sets.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 11/15/01 It is unlikely that Taylor will play Sunday against Pittsburgh. However, he is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. Taylor has been sidelined for over a month because of a groi! n ! injury.   Tony McGee , TE CIN - BCWD's Updated 11/15/01 McGee missed practice Wednesday because of a knee injury. However, he is expected to play in Sunday's game against Tennessee.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - G money Updated 11/14/01 Kinney is listed as questionable for Sunday's game because of a calf injury. He missed Monday's game because of the injury.   Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-! Ga! to Updated 11/14/01 Titans' head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennesean that Wycheck's sprained ankle is not a substantial injury. Wycheck suffered the injury Monday, but is expected to play in Sunday's game.  Shad Meier , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Meier is still recovering from thumb surgery and is questionable for Sunday's game. He would have gotten substantial playing time Monday against Baltimore had he played, but won't be needed now that the Titans have two healthy tight ends.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 Zereoue is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. He has been sidelined for almost a month because of a shoulder injury.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starboy Updated 11/14/01 An MRI on Jones' injured shoulder didn't reveal any structural damage. However, his status for Sunday's game remains uncertain.   Mike McMahon , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 According to published reports, the Lions hope to give McMahon some limited action during upcoming games. He is not expected to play full-time, but this development means that Charlie Batch might lose some playing time, hurting his overall Fantasy value.  Byron Chamberlain , TE MIN - Oper Error Updated 11/14/01 An MRI revealed a small cartilage tear in Chamberlain's right knee, but he is not expected to require surgery. All signs point to him playing Monday against the Giants, so feel free to use him this week.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Kar Bombs Updated 11/14/01 The San Diego Union-Tribune says Jones (ankle) has been advised against playing this week. Results of an MRI exam are not available yet, but Steve Heiden is expected to start in his place.  Tim Dwight , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Dwight (lung) is doubtful for Sunday's game. He has not been very healthy when productive, so don't count on him for much production from him during the rest of the season.  Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Hambrick is dealing with a rotator cuff injury, but he's expected to practice later in the week. He'll likely start his third consecutive game this weekend if Emmitt Smith's knee isn't 100 percent by Friday.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/14/01 Smith (knee) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. If he is unable to go, Troy Hambrick would likely start his third straight game, barring any further damage to his injured shoulder.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Perrito-style Updated 11/14/01 Weinke (shou! ld! er) was only able to throw on the sidelines Tuesday, but was expected to practice on Wednesday. If he is unable to play, Matt Lytle would likely make his second consecutive start.   Peyton Manning , QB IND - El-Gato Updated 11/14/01 The Indianapolis Star says Manning had a splint inserted to stabilize the teeth in his lower jaw. He is expected to start on Sunday.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - El-Gato Updated 11/14/01 Bledsoe has been cleared to play, but Tom Brady will start against the Rams. Bledsoe said he will try and prove he is ready to play by performing well in practice, but it doesn't appear likely he will get a chance to start. But the future past Week 10 appears to be unclear, and there is no guarantee Brady will hold onto the job past the Rams game.  O.J. McDuffie , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 McDuffie is ready to return to practice from the PUP list. He will be eligible for activation on Dec. 4, but he may still miss the rest of the season.  Aaron Brooks , QB NO - R-Diddy Updated 1! 1/! 14/01 According to published reports, many veterans on the New Orleans roster have expressed their displeasure with Brooks' inconsistency this season. The reports also stated that those same veterans would rather see Jeff Blake under center, but that doesn't seem likely to happen. The coaching staff feels as though Brooks has the talent to be a top-notch NFL quarterback, so don't expect a change under center any time soon.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley is expected to miss two weeks of action due to a sprained knee. He suffered the injury during last weekend's loss to Atlanta. Dallas' defense has played well, but they're an inconsistent unit from a Fantasy perspec! ti! ve.   Jon Hilbert , K NO - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Hilbert has been signed by the Dallas Cowboys, and will serve as their starting kicker in Tim Seder's absence. Hilbert's value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point, however, so don't bother picking him up outside of deeper leagues.   Tim Seder , K DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 Seder is expected to miss several weeks of action after injuring his ankle last Sunday against Atlanta. The team has signed former New Orleans booter Jon Hilbert to take over the kicking duties in Dallas.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Moore, who had hamstring surgery two weeks ago, will begin some light running on Wednesday. His status for the rest of the season is still unclear, however, so don't bother picking him up off the waiver wire.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Hardy (shoulder) is expected to miss a few more weeks of action. Unless you play in a very deep league, holding onto him isn't advisable at this point.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/14/01 Allen will be sidelined four to six weeks because of a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury in Monday's game. Jason Brookins will start in his absence.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/14/01 McNair will wear a cast on his throwing hand for at least a day after aggravating an injury during Monday night's 16-10 loss to Baltimore. He had X-rays and other tests on his right hand Tuesday, and coach Jeff Fisher said the results were negative. But doctors found an apparent hairline break in McNa! ir! 's thumb, which he originally hurt last season in practice. He is questionable for Sunday's game. ""We put him in a cast until tomorrow [Wednesday]. We'll see how he is with some soft tosses going with the hand,"" Fisher said.     Ricky Watters , RB SEA - God Updated 11/13/01 According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 11/13/01 Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/13/01 Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is ""unretiring,"" according to the ! De! nver Post. While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Tacos Updated 11/13/01 According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence.   More Updates  Teams Player News  [IMAGE]God Player News  Ricky Watters , Injured RB Updated 11/13/01 According to the Seattle Times, Watters is expected to return from his shoulder injury in two weeks. However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.  Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 11/13/01 Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 11/11/01 The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.  James Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 11/11/01 Jackson left Sunday's game in the second quarter with an apparent injury to his left ankle. He was replaced by Jamel White, and Jackson returned before halftime.  Troy Brown , Reserve WR Updated 11/08/01 Brown should have a good game this week. The Patriots should have little problem throwing the ball at home against Buffalo.  Terrell Owens , Active WR Updated 11/08/01 Owens continues to be one of the top wideouts in the league, catching nine passes for 125 yards and two scores against Detroit last week. Owens has had some big games in the past against this week's opponent, New Orleans, and is a must-start for Fantasy owners.   Wesley Walls , Active TE Updated 11/08/01 Wallas was held out of practice on Wednesday due to a hip injury. However, he is expected to play on Sunday against St. Louis.   Tom Brady , Reserve QB Updated 11/08/01 Brady should have another good outing this week. He shouldn't have much of a problem throwing the ball downfield in a home matchup with the Bills.  Qadry Ismail , Active WR Updated 11/04/01 Ismail caught five passes for 53 yards at Pittsburgh. While he did not score, Ismail performed well against a tough Pittsburgh defense, and he has clearly emerged as a reliable Fantasy player.  Shaun Alexander , Active RB Updated 11/04/01 Alexander rushed for 60 yards and a TD, and caught four passes for 42 yards at Washington. Even if opposing defenses key on him, Alexander will always post respectable Fantasy numbers.  Tim Biakabutuka , Reserve RB Updated 10/25/01 Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.   Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Mike Vanderjagt , Reserve K Updated 10/12/01 Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play against the Raiders.  Bills , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.   Buccaneers , Active DT Updated 08/08/01 Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesday.   John Carney , Active K Updated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  Members of Congress return from their Thanksgiving break on Tuesday as debate resumes in Washington.  A bill that would renew the Price Anderson Act is being brought to the floor of the House of Representatives.  The bill limits the liability for the nuclear industry in the event of a major accident.  Significant revisions were made to the legislation in the wake of the September 11 attacks, with the addition of amendments that would strengthen the security of America's nuclear power plants.     The Washington bureau will also have more reaction to the FERC's new policy for determining whether a company has market power in the electricity industry.  Join us for these reports from the Washington bureau on Tuesday.   From Houston on Tuesday, we'll bring you an update on Enron's continuing financial situation.  UBS PaineWebber's Robert Young is stopping by the Houston bureau to discuss his perspective on the negotiations between Enron and Dynegy.  He'll join us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   The Former Energy Advisor to the Prime Minister of Iran is speaking in Houston on Tuesday.  Dr. Fereidun Fesharaki will be talking to the Asia Society about the Middle East, oil and economics. The Houston bureau will bring us a preview.   Climate Solutions Co-Director Rhys Roth will be live from Olympia, Washington during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast on Tuesday.  West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas talks with Roth about the future of clean energy in the Northwest and how renewables will play a major role as a future energy source in the region.   We'll also have an update on the California Department of Water Resources' efforts to pay generators for market transactions between January and July of this year.  Join us for reports from the West Coast bureau.     ENL is hitting the road later this week.  Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will report live from Anchorage, Alaska.  Kim is attending a conference titled: Alaska Resources 2002: Can Alaska Compete?  We'll have live coverage from the conference starting on Thursday.   ENL's Gale Smith will attend the Arctic Gas Symposium in Houston on Thursday.  The symposium will address supplying the North American market and the latest pipeline route update, among other topics.  We'll have coverage of the symposium on Thursday.    Closing Prices for Monday, Nov. 26, 2001    Crude: $18.69 -$0.27   Unleaded: $0.5217 -$0.0056   Heating Oil: $0.05217 -$0.0125   Natural Gas: $2.696 -$0.117   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Huaneng Power International Announces
Plans for the Future, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Huaneng Power International, Incorporated (Beijing,
China) has announced its tenth five-year plan to be coordinated with
the construction of the China west-east natural gas pipeline. This
4,167 kilometers (2,604 miles) pipeline is still in the developmental
stages and is expected to start construction in the second half of
next year.
	   Huaneng Power plans the construction of two advanced combined
cycle gas turbine power plants in Jinling and Shanghai with a capacity
of 1,200 mega-watts (MW) each. It also has plans to continue to
develop large-scale mine-mouth coal-fired power plants adjacent to
coal mines with major road infrastructure in place. In addition to the
completion of the 1,320MW coal-fired Dezhou power plant, the company
also plans to expand its Shangan power plant with two 600MW coal-fired
units. If these projects are developed the power generated would be
4,920MW at a total cost of $3.2 billion, and it would raise Huaneng
Power's total generation capacity from its current 10,813MW up to
15,7335MW.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Energy Markets as well as other
industrial sectors send inquiries to powergroup@industrialinfo.com or

His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a de! ce! nt Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 ! There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewh! at! of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito! -s! tyle Updated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyle Brady , TE JAC - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy ! Sm! ith  , WR JAC - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at running back.  M! arcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver. Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/01 Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be Clark.

 	 	    Dear Joe,  The Washington bureau will have a full plate when we return from Thanksgiving break.  Congress returns with many lawmakers urging action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a long list of legislation ahead of energy in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but Republicans are threatening to force a vote through a filibuster.  In turn, Democrats are saying they'll filibuster any energy bill containing a provision to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  The legislation battle continues next week.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the FERC's major decisions regarding how it assesses market power.  The Commission announced a major change this week that will impact many of the large and small utilities across the country.   Also next week, we'll see what Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King has to say about Pat Wood's performance as Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham - on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's hearing in Washington.   ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week on a Louisiana company that uses rice hulls to create power.  Agrilectric Incorporated consumes some of this power, but most of the electricity is sold to an area utility company.  We'll have details next week.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction.   We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate.  There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor.     Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants.  We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday.   Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor.  Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area.  On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies.  We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas.  South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America.    Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter.  Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.   The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access.     Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity.  This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world.  Kym will bring us details on Thursday.   Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15.  Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings.  And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings.  Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) First New Natural Gas Pipeline System
to Serve Florida in Over 40 Years is Under Construction, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Gulfstream Natural Gas System L.L.C. (Houston)
began construction on the 753 mile long Gulfstream pipeline in July of
2001. The pipeline originates near Pascagoula, Miss., and terminates
in Palm Beach County, Fla. When completed the 753 mile natural gas
transmission pipeline will consist of 431 miles of 36"" diameter
offshore pipeline and 306 miles of varying diameter (16"" to 36"")
onshore pipeline mostly located in Florida. The massive pipe weighs
eight tons per 40-foot section.
	   The support facilities for this $1.6 billion venture include a
natural gas processing plant and a 120,000 horsepower compressor
station near Coden, Ala. Approximately 200 miles of the offshore
portion have been laid by three lay barges and the compressor station
was 17 percent complete as of Oct. 1, 2001. Similar progress has been
made on the onshore portion in Florida.
	   Once completed in June 2002, Gulfstream will be the largest
pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico and will initially transport 1.1
billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to supply Florida's growing
gas-fired electrical generation needs. This new pipeline will help
satisfy Florida's need for 25 percent more electrical generation by
2007 and the 179 percent increase in demand for natural gas over the
next decade.
	   Gulfstream Natural Gas System L.L.C. is a joint energy development
between Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Williams
(Tulsa, Okla.) is a $32 billion energy company delivering 16 percent
of all natural gas consumed in the U.S. through a network of over
27,000 miles of pipelines. Duke Energy (Charlotte, N.C.) is a diverse
energy company with revenues of over $22 billion in 2000.

market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - God Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because! o! f his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - God Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tacos Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Hurricanes Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Tacos Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01! Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - BCWD's Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a! g! ood outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Hurricanes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - God Updated 11/25/01! Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - BCWD's Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01  Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Kar Bombs Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Perrito-style Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Perrito-style Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington! . ! He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - G money Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed ! Su! nday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - El-Gato Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Joe,  On Monday, the Washington bureau will follow up on the President's new push for energy legislation in Congress.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Friday, we heard some of the President's strongest language to date, urging Democrats in the Senate to bring a bill to the floor.    There are also several energy hearings scheduled in Congress next week, including one on possible new limits on power plant emissions in the Senate and another on MTBE in the House. The hearings are some of the first to be rescheduled since the anthrax scare hit Congress earlier this month.   RDI Consulting Principal Mark Morey is penciled in from the Washington bureau on Monday.  He'll share his insight on where the emissions issue stands on the Hill during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Secretary of Interior Gale Norton was in Houston Friday at the IPAA conference.  On Monday Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us more from Secretary Norton on Lease Sale 181 and how drilling in ANWR will create thousands of jobs for Texans.     Noble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bureau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings.  The company reported very good earnings but Day warns that the fourth quarter may not be as good because of a weakening economy.  Join us for all the details on Monday.     ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Western States Petroleum Association Spokesperson Dave Fogarty next week.  Fogarty will discuss California's decision to ban MTBE by December 31, 2002 and whether the state is ready for this move.  Catch Fogarty from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday.    Former Governor Pete Wilson tells Kym he takes responsibility for signing the state's deregulation plan, but adds there were steps Governor Gray Davis could and should have taken to avoid what turned out to be an energy crisis.  Kym will have all the details on this story next week.   Finally from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to talk about the gas market during the noon ET newscast.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.  Have a fantastic weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

My name is Castlen Moore, and I work with Narsimha Misra on the EES desk.  Anna Santucci and I are managing the Nepool hedging for EES, and Narsimha mentioned you might have a spreadsheet that could be helpful to us.  He said he thought it was pulling info daily from the web on various fundamentals.  Give me a call or email me when you have a minute.  Anything on Nepool would be greatly appreciated by Anna and I.

Thanks!

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Russians and De Beers Cutting a Diamond
Supply Deal, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Looking to assure themselves of a minimum of
$500 million worth of rough Russian diamonds per annum, De Beers
(Johannesburg, South Africa) is looking to sign a long term agreement
on diamond marketing in December when the current agreement expires.
The Russians favor a deal between De Beers and the Russian diamond
company Alrosa thus being able to protect and control the adequate
supply of rough diamonds to the home industry and enable it to work
profitably.
	   Reports say that an agreement has been drafted and details are
being ironed out between the Russians and the South Africans. Over the
last two years, De Beers purchased around $1 billion of rough stones
in Moscow and they need the supply to maintain the variety they offer
clients. In the specialized world of diamond supply and demand
negotiations, De Beers does not want the Russian cutters to have sole
first rights over the best stones coming from the mine.
	   De Beers, the world's leading diamond producer was acquired
earlier this year by DB Investments and is currently delisted from the
JSE and LSE.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Metals and Minerals industry as well
as other industrial sectors send inquiries to

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

He should be fine, although he's going up against a stingy Ravens rush defense this week.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Ward has been downgraded from questionable to out for Sunday's game against Carolina due to a foot injury. He's no longer worth wa! st! ing a roster spot on.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 10/31/01 Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Green Bay due to a hip pointer. He could be ready by the end of the week, but you might as well keep him reserved this week.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Tacos Updated 10/31/01 Johnson did not practice Monday and is listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Green Bay due to a bone bruise on his right knee. Don't use him this week unless it becomes clear he will play.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Perrito-style Updated 10/31/01 Dunn is expected to return to the lineup Sunday at Green Bay. He would serve as the starting tailback, with Mike Alstott moving back to fullback.  Mike Alstott , RB TB - Kar Bombs Updated 10/31/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy plans to return Alstott to his fullback position if Warrick Dunn returns to the lineup as expected Sunday at Green Bay. ""To me it's not so much what we do or who we're going to get the ball to,"" Dungy said. ""Aaron Stecker averaged about 6 ya! rd! s a carry yesterday. That's not to say Mike didn't do a good job, but we can't look at it and say, ""Just because Mike Alstott was the ballcarrier, that's why we got things going.' "" We expect Tampa Bay to give Alstott increased carries at Dunn's expense if both play, in which case neither will be a great starter in Week Eight.  Rian Lindell , K SEA - Kar Bombs Updated 10/31/01 According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer , the Seahawks worked out three free-agent kickers on Tuesday as they consider switching from Lindell. Shayne Graham, Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso were brought in for tryouts, although Head Coach Mike Holmgren is likely to give Lindell one more chance to redeem himself. Keep an eye on this situation - Lindell is a pretty risky kicker to own right now.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Beegs Boys Updated 10/31/01 Zereoue is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Baltimore due to a shoulder injury. If he can't go, Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala would assume the third-down back role and the backup job to Jerome Bettis. Based on Bettis' great play this season, don't expect either Zereoue or Fuamatu-Ma'afala to help your team unless Bettis gets hurt. ! Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Chrebet, who has been suffering from headaches stemming from a concussion he suffered on Oct. 14, should resume practicing on Wednesday. He should be able to play on Sunday, but hold off starting him until an official decision is made.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G money Updated 10/31/01 Alexander is considered probable for Sunday's game at San Diego despite injured ribs. If by some chance he can't play, Larry Parker would likely get the start.  Mike Green , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Green and Skip Hicks are expected to split carries for the Titans if Eddie George is unable to play Sunday against Jacksonville. This isn't a good scenario for solid Fantasy stats, and we don't recommend you use either this week. However, you might want to pick up Green and/or Hicks in a deeper league in case George's injury is deemed long-term.  Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 10/31/01 According to the Nashville Tennessean, George suffered multiple injuries during Monday's game against Pittsbu! rg! h and could miss Sunday's game against Jacksonville as a result. ""It is unlikely Eddie [will practice] much this week, we'll just have to wait and see,"" said Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher. George is battling a hyperextended left knee, left quad (thigh) contusion and a sprained right ankle. He's a real risk to use this week unless it's definite that he will be able to play.  Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Carter is likely to return from hamstring surgery in about four weeks. While he could get some playing time at QB for the Cowboys, he's not worth picking up this season.  Clint Stoerne!   , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo is leaning towards starting Stoerner against the Giants on Sunday, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. However, backup Ryan Leaf could see some time depending on the outcome of the game. We still don't recommend either player for Fantasy purposes.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/31/01 According to The Dallas Morning News, Smith's sprained right knee probably will not prevent him from playing Sunday against the Giants. However, he won't practice Wednesday and will likely be limited for the rest of the week. ""If he's ready at 1 p.m. Sunday, New York time, then he'll start at running back,"" s! ai! d Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo. ""It's just a day-to-day situation, and it's relatively mild."" If Smith can't go, Troy Hambrick would start at halfback with J.J. Huggins at fullback. We expect Smith to be fine and start this week.  Jim Miller , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Miller expects to be ready for his fifth straight start Sunday against Cleveland despite a left hip pointer, according to the Chicago Sun-Times . ""I feel pretty good,"" he said. ""I'm going to practice [today], and we'll see how it feels. [Today] will be the deciding factor. Guys on this team are working really hard, and I don't want to be the one to let them down. I want to continue to play and keep on winning."" Miller will probably start, but Shane Matthews will be ready to go if not. We don't recommend you use Miller unless he is officially slated to start.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/31/01 Allen will run Tuesday for the first time after being limited to treading water in the pool at the team training facility due to a sprained ankle. Jason Brookins would get the start if Allen can't go, and that's probably the better situation for Fantasy owners in the first place. Only use Broo! k! ins of the two, if you dare use him against Pittsburgh.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/31/01 Grbac is likely to be listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Pittsburgh due to strained rib cartilage. He has been progressing in his recovery, which suggests only some fibers were torn, but all indications are that he will not play. Randall Cunningham would get the start if Grbac can't go, and at this point we can't recommend you use any Baltimore QB.  Rob Moore , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Moore underwent another MRI on his injured hamstring on Monday, and is waiting for the results. We don't expect him to help anyone's Fantasy squad the remainder of the season.  Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 10/31/01 Hardy could miss two-to-three weeks due to a rotator cuff injury, according to The Arizona Republic. ""Terry may be out for a while,"" said Cardinals Head Coach Dave McGinnis. ""They're going to immobilize it (the shoulder) in a sling, and he, for sure, will not be there this week. However much longer it will be is to be determined, but I think it's probably a multiple-week thing."" Don't bother holding on to Hardy.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - BCWD's Updated 10/31/01 Pittman is still recovering from his second concussion in the past three weeks. The Cardinals are likely to go with Thomas Jones and Marcel Shipp for Sunday's game against Philadelphia as a result. We don't recommend any of the three against the tough Eagles rush defense.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 10/30/01 Smith is day to day after receiving results of his MRI, according to published reports. He will not practice Tuesday or Wednesday but could return on Thursday. Smith looks like a go for Week Eight.  Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Perrito-style Updated 10/30/01 Alexander is likely to miss his third straight game Sunday against Seattle due to a high ankle sprain. The Redskins are targeting their November 18 game at Dallas for his return.  Eddie George , RB TEN - BCWD's Updated 10/30/01 George left Monday's game in the third quarter after injuring his knee. He is scheduled for an MRI on Tuesday. ""It's not the ACL or the MCL, it's behind the knee,"" head coach Jeff Fisher told The Nashville Tennessean. ""We'll have to take a look at it and we'll know mor! e ! about the situation in the next couple of days.""    Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 10/30/01 Wheatley's injured wrist and knee have improved but his status for Sunday's game is uncertain. He is listed as questionable.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/30/01 Ward is not expected to play Sunday against the Panthers. He is listed as questionable.   Chris Chambers  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/30/01 Chambers suffered a bruised rib in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. He is also expected to practice.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/30/01 Parker could be the Chief new starting receiver, replacing incumbent Derrick Alexander. ""I might [start Parker],"" head coach Dick Vermeil told The Kansas City Star.""I don't know. I'll talk to the coaches."" Consider adding Parker to your roster. He had two TD receptions in the Chiefs last game.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - G ! mo! ney Updated 10/30/01 Alexander is still suffering from torn cartilage in his ribs and might not play Sunday. ""If I feel like this going into the weekend, I won't be able to play,"" Alexander told The Kansas City Star. Alexander still might not start when he regains his health. The Chiefs are considering starting rookie Larry Parker over Alexander.     Marshall Faulk , RB STL - R-Diddy Updated 10/30/01 Faulk is expected to return to the Rams' starting lineup on November 11 against Carolina.  More Updates   Player News Teams  [IMAGE]God Player News  Jeff Garcia , Active QB Updated 10/30/01 Garcia suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament during Sunday's game at Chicago. He might need to wear a protective brace for next Sunday's game against Detroit, but is expected to play. Don't be afraid to use Garcia against the Lions' poor secondary.  Rob Johnson , Reserve QB Updated 10/29/01 Johnson injured his right foot in Sunday's game at San Diego. The injury is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hurt his elbow and shoulder.  Troy Brown , Reserve WR Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Shaun Alexander , Active RB Updated 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 10/26/01 Smith has a leg injury but is expected to play this week. He is listed as probable on the injury report. Expect Smith to overcome his injury and be a solid Fantasy back this week.   Terrell Owens , Active WR Updated 10/26/01 Owens set the record for most receptions in a game the last time he played the Bears. He won't be as effective this week, but will be a productive receiver.   Wesley Walls , Active TE Updated 10/26/01 Walls will get a lot of important looks this week. The Panthers should move the ball rather well against the Jets, and Walls may be open for TD catches near the goal line.  Qadry Ismail , Active WR Updated 10/26/01 Ismail has developed into a good all-around receiver. He is definitely worth a start against the inconsistent Jaguars secondary.  Tim Biakabutuka , Reserve RB Updated 10/25/01 Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.   Ricky Watters , Injured RB Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.  Az-Zahir Hakim , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   James Jackson , Reserve RB Updated 10/21/01 Jackson had a surprisingly productive game against Baltimore, rushing for 77 yards and a score. The rookie seems to be all the way back from a nagging rib injury, and is slowly becoming a good Fantasy player.   Ken Dilger , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Mike Vanderjagt , Reserve K Updated 10/12/01 Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play against the Raiders.  Bills , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.   Buccaneers , Active DT Updated 08/08/01 Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesday.   John Carney , Active K Updated 04/15/01 Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - G money Updated 11/24/01 Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from his second arthroscopic surgery this year.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - El-Gato Updated 11/24/01 Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game.   Darnay Scott , WR CIN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - El-G! at! o Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Starboy Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville! J! aguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.    Rod Smith , WR DEN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - G money Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  Olandis Gary, RB DEN - El-Gato Updated 11/23/01Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - El-Gato Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Tacos Updated 11/21/01Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Perrito-style Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - R-Diddy Updated 11/21/01  Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - God Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Starboy Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 ! There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Beegs Boys Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewh! at! of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

"Football Trade","I have called for a league wide vote on that obviously one-sided trade 
that went down today.  Looks like 1-5 team collaborated with a 
contending team on the trade deadline day to try a pull a fast one on the

""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Oper Error Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Kar Bombs Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - Kar Bombs Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - BCWD's Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Starboy Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Beegs Boys Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - God Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Oper Error Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - God Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - R-Diddy Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Kar Bombs Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Tacos Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   God Player News    Ricky Watters  , Injured RB Updated 10/23/01  According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Lamar Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/23/01  Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Az-Zahir Hakim  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.    Tim Biakabutuka  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01  Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Troy Brown  , Reserve WR Updated 10/21/01  Brown had a huge game against Indianapolis, catching eight passes for 120 yards and a score. He continues to establish himself as a reliable Fantasy player, and may even better once Terry Glenn returns from a hamstring injury.    James Jackson  , Reserve RB Updated 10/21/01  Jackson had a surprisingly productive game against Baltimore, rushing for 77 yards and a score. The rookie seems to be all the way back from a nagging rib injury, and is slowly becoming a good Fantasy player.    Qadry Ismail  , Active WR Updated 10/19/01  Ismail will catch a few passes this week but don't expect him to score any touchdowns. He has just two TD receptions in five games.    Wesley Walls  , Active TE Updated 10/18/01  Walls is proving that he is still one of the best tight ends in the league Fantasy-wise. Unless you have a better option, Walls is a must-start against Washington.    Ken Dilger  , Reserve TE Updated 10/18/01  Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.    Jeff Garcia  , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago.    Rob Johnson  , Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01  Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.    Terrell Owens  , Active WR Updated 10/14/01  Owens had a super outing against Atlanta, catching nine passes for 183 yards and three TDs, including the game-winner, a 52-yarder in overtime. Owens is definitely maintaining his place among Fantasy Football's best receivers.    Shaun Alexander  , Active RB Updated 10/14/01  Alexander had another great game, rushing for 142 yards and two TDs on 33 carries against Denver. Alexander has clearly established himself as a Fantasy standout, and he has ignited the Seattle offense. If he continues to play at his current level, he might hold onto the feature back job, even when Ricky Watters returns.    Mike Vanderjagt  , Reserve K Updated 10/12/01  Vanderjagt (toe) kicked in practice on Thursday. He is expected to play against the Raiders.    Bills  , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01  Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.    Buccaneers  , Active DT Updated 08/08/01  Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesday.    John Carney  , Active K Updated 04/15/01  Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points.

     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox at the end of every week. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Fantasy Football Matchups   ? Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a  premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to  help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our  Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar)  Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.  	


    Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want     Did you know you can customize the settings of most reports  on the site, and save those settings so they are displayed  each time you visit the report? For example, suppose you'd  like the Transactions, View report to display only Add/Drops  over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter those settings,  click GO and then click the Save icon displayed over the  report. Now each time you click Transactions, View on the toolbar, the report is displayed according to your custom  settings. After you click Save you can click the E-Rept icon to have your new custom report e-mailed to you on the days you choose.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  	


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  	


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  	


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

"Re: FW: Stepenovitch","

I guess in the scheme of things one of the reasons you try not to go to
trial is to prevent this from happening.  Plus it takes a long time to
prepare for the case and it looks like your attorney wants to win.  Do you
want me to call Tonya and explain to her that going forward things are not
going to be pretty.  I think I can do this in a gentle and concerning way.
Or should I not be involved?
Love,
Mom

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone, 

	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game. 
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob. 

	We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

"FW: Move Related Issues","

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) LS Power Shifts Focus Towards
Development of New Coal-Fired Plants, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). LS Power Development LLC (East Brunswick,
N.J.), a fast growing Private Energy Producer (PEP) and developer, has
shifted its focus towards the development of new coal-fired power
plants. Once a very active player in the race to construct new natural
gas-fired generating plants, LS Power announced in late 2000 plans to
divest some 5,633 megawatts (MW) of natural gas-fired operating plants
and projects in construction and advanced development. The sale to NRG
Energy Incorporated (Minneapolis) (NYSE:NRG) was finalized in early
2001 and included ten natural gas-fired projects located in Illinois,
Mississippi, Florida and Texas.
	   LS Power has not ruled out further development of new natural
gas-fired power plants, but in recent months has announced aggressive
plans for development of new coal-fired generating stations. Research
conducted by IndustrialInfo.com has identified six coal-fired projects
in the early stages of development being proposed by LS Power. If
built, these projects would be located in at least five different
states and represent over 6,000MW coming into operation by 2007.
Announcements for an additional six coal-fired projects could be
forthcoming by LS Power over the next several months.
	   LS Power Development LLC is a privately held Private Energy
Producer that develops, finances, owns and manages independent power
projects in the United States with headquarters in East Brunswick,
N.J., and a major development office in Saint Louis.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Energy and Power markets as well as
other industrial sectors send inquiries to

Boo Williams and Lamont Hall will split time at tight end in his absence.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 White (ankle) will start Sunday's game. He still may not do much against the Tampa Bay defense.   James Jackson , RB CLE - God Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White started against the Ravens.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01 McNair will start Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking pre-game snaps without any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb injury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper leagues.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Beegs Boys Updated 11/18/01 Green (abdominal strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will start in his absence.  James Stewart , RB DET - Tacos Updated 11/18/01 Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting closer to returning to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Battaglia (appendectomy) has been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy! p! layer.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - G money Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Starboy Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack will get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is not a wise move.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Kar Bombs Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis Star. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson , RB CLE - God Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decison on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - El-Gato Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - El-Gato Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - El-Gato Updated 11/16/01According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Beegs Boys Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Hurricanes Updated 11/16/01!  Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as ! he! 's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Perrito-style Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly b! as! is.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Starboy Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Tacos Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid F! an! tasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - R-Diddy Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Oper Error Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Oper Error U! pdated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - El-Gato Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   ! Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - God Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.
