I sent her an email thanking her and answering her questions. I will follow-up with a phone call later this week when I get back from Fort Lauderdale-have to go there for work. 

On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.  I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.  Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.  It gave me some good insight.

Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.  I have to join the LONGEST conference call in the world in a couple minutes.  Cheers,
Beth

Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

Jonda,

I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me and
my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I have
cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails (trying
to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do that
so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will forward
them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I really
think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she is
mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go
over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury trial?
Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something to
Tonya?  I don't understand....

I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for work
(not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after 3:30.
I hope that helps

Thanks again,

The awards ceremony will be held at the E-World of Energy conference in
Essen in February 2002. The results will also be published in the December
issue of Commodities Now.

Nominations can be for women working in ANY sector of the energy industry
globally, in any job, with honours being given for the display of particular
characteristics or skills in their work.

To nominate a candidate, fill in the form at www.commodities-now.com
Alternatively, print out the attached PDF file and complete the 5 steps

I will give her a call tomorrow.  My boss is leaving earlier than me on Thursday, so maybe I could meet with her then.  Thanks for the suggestion.

I sent her an email thanking her and answering her questions. I will follow-up with a phone call later this week when I get back from Fort Lauderdale-have to go there for work. 

On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.  I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.  Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.  It gave me some good insight.

Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.  I have to join the LONGEST conference call in the world in a couple minutes.  Cheers,
Beth

Hey Joe-
I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

Subject:	RE: Stepenovitch

Dear Joe:

In order to prepare your case for trial, several things are necessary, as
follows:

1.  Depositions must be taken of you and Tonya.

2.  We must send discovery to Tonya and we must have sufficient time
pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for it to be answered prior
to trial.

3.  The Court will require mediation before we can go to trial.

4. The Court will appoint a mental health examiner and possible an attorney
ad litem to represent Payton's best interests.

This is now a case where custody and possession are an issue and these steps
MUST be taken before we can proceed to trial.  Initially, after paternity
was established and you first visited with Payton, your desire was that all
possession periods would be worked out by agreement and neither you nor
Tonya wanted any more court proceedings.  However, since then, Tonya has
bucked your every request for visitation and put limitations of one kind or
another on it, turning the case into a custody case.  Without discovery to
Tonya (similar to the discovery we answered for you) and Tonya's deposition
and a mental health evaluation, we are not prepared for trial and the Court
would not be ready to hear the case and entertain what was in Payton's best
interest.  Therefore, Mr. Fullenweider did not opposed Stewart Gagnon's
motion for continuance, and would have, in fact, have filed one himself in
keeping with your best interest (and Payton's) in mind.

As I explained, we are working on a Request for Temporary Orders, which I
expect will be set on 11/14/01, along with the hearing on mental
evaluations.  At that time, I expect the court to set your possession
periods with Payton, including holidays.  Until then, we must work on
scheduling your possession periods by agreement.

To confirm your November 3rd visitation period, you have chosen to have
Payton from 12:00 noon to 7:00 p.m. in Vero Beach on the 3rd and will forego
November 4th. Where will you pick up and drop off Payton?

Good Morning Jonda,

I received the papers from you yesterday about the continuance.  I was
under the impression that it was the court moving the date.  It looks like
to me its Tonya and her Lawyer.  They have been doing pushing this case
back from the start and I'm sure they are doing this for a reason (to say
to the jury: that a bond has been created and its not in the best interest
of the child to go with his father after being with his mother for so long)
At this point if we go to trial Payton will be 1 year old and I will have
only seen him about 12 times.  I don't think I will win that battle!

As for the November 12th court date will we have something in writing by
the judge so I can start having my rights!  I feel like her and her lawyer
can tell us what to do and we must follow there rules.  Will this change or
do I have to go through this until the April court date?  That can't be how
is system works.  I should have the right to pick my own son up whenever I
want and no court or lawyer or even his mother should have anything to say
about that.  I don't understand why everything is against me?

Finally,  for the weekend of Nov 1st I will take my son for the whole day
(in Vero) on Saturday and forego Sunday.

   would like to take Payton to Vero Beach on  Saturday, November 3rd, you
   may have him from 12:00 to 7:00, if you are willing  to forego
   visitation on Sunday and let Tonya have him all day on  Sunday.

I will send the answers to your Mom directly, but the reason I have moved around at Enron is b/c I was in the associate program. As you know, we rotate every six months.  The reason I am looking for something new in Florida is because that is where my boyfriend is and since we are talking about getting engaged, we both think it would be much more successful if we lived in the same place (just kidding).  Thanks again and I hope you enjoyed yourself in Vegas.

Joe,
I have a couple questions.
1. Why is she looking for a new job?
2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.
Love,
Mom
I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last
night.  I'm not sure why. She really wants you at her birthday party.  I
told her you would see her on Friday.

He has a  walker and he loves to sit in it and just talk away.  He is such a happy  baby, everyone enjoys him and loves to see him, he's so pleasant.

"RE: Discovery Responses","Jonda,

I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me and my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I have cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails (trying to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do that so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will forward them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I really think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she is mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury trial?  Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something to Tonya?  I don't understand....

I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for work (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after 3:30.  I hope that helps

could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

Dear  Joe:
 
See the attached email  from Miryam Mitchell at Stewart Gagnon's office.  Please let me know if you  agree to their suggested visitation times.  If you need to fly out earlier  on Sunday which would prevent you having him until 4:00, I'll explain that to  Miryam and suggest 1:00 to 7:00 on Saturday and 1:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Or  1:00 to 6:00 on Saturday and 12:00 to 3:00 on Sunday.  Let me know which  you prefer.
 
It appears that Tonya is  willing to give you increased access to Payton as he gets older and as he gets  to know you better.  I know this has been a frustrating process for  you.  I think (it is not my legal opinion since I'm not an attorney) that  it would be beneficial to request an extra hour or two at each visitation so  that we work up to overnights.  I know it can't be soon enough for you, but  small steps are always an improvement in the right  direction!!
 
Let me know about the  visitation and where you want to meet Tonya.  At your hotel?  Will you  be taking him out of Merritt Island?
 
Jonda

Jonda,
 
Tonya does not agree to  1 - 8 on Saturday and also from 1 - 3 on Sunday.
 
However, she's willing  to make a compromise suggestion as follows:
 
The visitation on   Saturday from 1 - 4 and again from 6 - 8 is a total of 5 (five) hours.   Rather than Joe having to  pick up Payton twice and deliver him twice on Saturday, Tonya  suggest that Joe take Payton from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, and again from  1:00 to 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.
 
She would also like  written confirmation of exactly where Joe wants to meet to pick up Payton and  exactly where he will deliver Payton back to her.
 
Tonya also like to know, if Joe accepts the  5-hour visitation on Saturday, whether Joe intends to take Payton outside  of Merritt Island, and if so where.  It is not her intent to prevent Joe's  doing so, she simply wants to know if Payton is going to be traveling out of  town.
 
Can we agree on the  foregoing?

I can't guarantee what time he will call today, but it will have to be
between appointments.  As he will be at a seminar all next week, his
appointments were scheduled VERY tight this week, along with three days of
depositions which have been scheduled for over 2 months.  It may not be
until this evening.  He has your work and cell phone numbers.

   Jonda,

   I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me
   and
   my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I
   have
   cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails
   (trying
   to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do
   that
   so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will
   forward
   them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I
   really
   think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she
   is
   mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

   Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go
   over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury
   trial?
   Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something
   to
   Tonya?  I don't understand....

   I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for
   work
   (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after
   3:30.
   I hope that helps

   Thanks again,

      hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a

      I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery

I guess in the scheme of things one of the reasons you try not to go to
trial is to prevent this from happening.  Plus it takes a long time to
prepare for the case and it looks like your attorney wants to win.  Do you
want me to call Tonya and explain to her that going forward things are not
going to be pretty.  I think I can do this in a gentle and concerning way.
Or should I not be involved?
Love,
Mom

Hi Joe-
I am Suzette's friend-the one looking for jobs (on the sly of course) in the greater Tampa and/or St. Petersburg area.  She had suggested I send my resume to you for potential contacts at FPL and Bank of America.  

I am currently in the associate program but have a 'unique' concentration.  I was hired into the marketing track and have focused mainly on those areas here at Enron.  Let me know if you have any questions for me-here's a recent copy of my resume which includes my latest rotation.  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards,

On a sidenote-it was good to see her questions.  I have decided to re-format my resume to make the Enron piece more consistent.  Although Enron people appreciate adaptability and changing roles, I understand non-Enron people may interpret that as NOT being able to hold a job.  It gave me some good insight.

Okay-let me know if you have any other thoughts.  I have to join the LONGEST conference call in the world in a couple minutes.  Cheers,

I have a couple questions.

2. She does not seem to stay very long in one position.  I would question
why?

Her resume looks great but I sense something with her that you need to
convince me otherwise before I forward to Personnel.

I have Alyssa with me for three days.  She talked about you all night last

Joe, I really appreciate your offer to forward my resume to your father at FPL.  I forwarded my resume to Irma Sulaiman @ FPL yesterday in response to a job posting in yesterday's Houston Chronicle.

The position, ""Energy Trader"", calls for at least 1-3 years of experience in fuels, energy marketing or energy trading; all of which I have experience in.

Below is the cover letter and resume that I e-mailed yesterday.  Again, I truly appreciate you helping me out!

<<<<Cover Letter>>>>

I would like to express my interest in the ""Energy Trader"" position posted in the Houston Chronicle, Sunday, December 2, 2001.

I have been trading power at Enron for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect and am very familiar with all facets of executing hourly and daily trades, including the utilization of trading tools and indices for all energy commodities.

I have over nine years of related experience and have also received my MBA during my four-year tenure at Enron.  My experience ranges from petroleum terminal management, refining and wholesale marketing, fuel management, pipeline and vessel/barge scheduling; liquefied natural gas (LNG); and trading power for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect power grid.

My attached resume illustrates an intense level of vertically integrated experience and knowledge of the energy business.  I believe that my vast experience and advanced education could be of great benefit to your company.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss career options with someone at your company.

Sincerely,

Dustin Collins

family and friends, including addresses and phone numbers, of those who have
knowledge of this situation, especially your mom and sister and anyone who
had firsthand knowledge (not just things you've told them, but things they
knew or experienced) of the issues in this case.  For instance, a coworker
might know things you've told while all this has been going on, but a common
friend or neighbor would have more significant knowledge.

Also, if you would go through the Interrogatories and take a stab at
answering the questions that you have answers to, it will save you a lot of
attorney fee time.

Thanks!
Jonda

   Joe-

   I can't guarantee what time he will call today, but it will have to be
   between appointments.  As he will be at a seminar all next week, his
   appointments were scheduled VERY tight this week, along with three days
   of
   depositions which have been scheduled for over 2 months.  It may not be
   until this evening.  He has your work and cell phone numbers.

      Can you come Tuesday at 3:45 to meet with me?

      I have given Mr. Fullenweider a message to call you in the interim.

      Jonda,

      I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me
      and
      my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I
      have
      cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails
      (trying
      to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to
   do
      that
      so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will
      forward
      them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I
      really
      think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or
   she
      is
      mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

      Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to
   go
      over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury
      trial?
      Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the
   something
      to
      Tonya?  I don't understand....

      I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting
   for
      work
      (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after
      3:30.
      I hope that helps

      Thanks again,

      -Joe

         Dear Joe,

         I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back
         meetings,
         hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a
      short
         telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition
         schedule
         may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge
      rules
         at a
         hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the
   Court,
      I
         could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

         I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery
         responses
         because I will be out of town next week and they are due next
   Friday.

         Good Morning Jonda,

         I would like to met with Mr. Fullenweider today if that is
   possible?
         I'm
         going out of town Thursday thru Sunday of this week.  I think it

            Dear Joe,

            Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at
      about
         3:00
            p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you
      could
            come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for
   my
