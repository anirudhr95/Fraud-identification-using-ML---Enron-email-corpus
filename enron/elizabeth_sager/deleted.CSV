"RE: TCA question","This language looks fine to me, but ELIZABETH is the structure ok with you? (The participating transmission owners (PTO) will be getting paid their revenue requirements by the RTO, so I think the RTO and the PTOs having a lock box is fine.  (from what I can recall from my old accountant days).  Thanks.

Christi and Susan,

Below is a message that I had sent to Steve Walton earlier this morning asking for his assessment of a section of the Acme (DSTAR) TCA.  Can you tell me if the text below is standard practice or is it more than favorable to the PTO?

Thanks,

Dave

Steve,

Are you familar with any fund(s) management in the context of RTO West or other such entity.  Below is some of the language in the ""Acme"" aka DSTAR TCA, I am not expereinced in this at all, but some of this looks suspect to me (Too may PTO rights).  Any comments you have would be helpful.

Thanks,

Dave

"" Acme shall enter into a lockbox account agreement (the ""Lockbox Account Agreement"") with all of the Participating TOs and the Lockbox Bank in form and substance satisfactory to the Participating TOs, providing among other things for the following:
(i)	the transmission of the netted TCA fees, due and payable to the Participating TO, in the Operating Account, on the Acme Payment Date, by the Lockbox Bank to the Payment Account for each Participating TO, and the Participating TOs' right, without the consent of Acme, to withdraw amounts on deposit in such Participating TO's Payment Account as and when desired by such Participating TO;

(ii)	the Participating TO's right to receive, on a monthly basis, statements from the Lockbox Bank detailing all activity in the Operating Account and the Participating TO's Payment Account, and copies of all correspondence received by Acme or the Lockbox Bank in connection with the Operating Account and such Participating TO's Payment Account;

the Participating TO's right at any time to audit the cash flow, investments, and the books and records of the Lockbox Bank related to the Operating Account and such Participating TO's Payment Account and to request and receive copies of information relating to the cash flow, investments, books and records and other documentation related to the Operating Account and the Participating TO's Payment Account in connection with any such audit or otherwise;

Enron's Collapse Has Experts Questioning Future of Electric  Deregulation
The collapse of energy company Enron has several  experts questioning its impacts on the future of electric deregulation. Analysts  say that the company's public championing of electric deregulation in Florida  and its current financial situation might signal caution to state regulators.  ""Enron was the most visible and ardent cheerleader of deregulation, and I think  what's happened to them is going to raise all these questions about  deregulation,"" says Jim Owen, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute.  Another view comes from Steven Weiss of the Center of Responsive Politics in  Washington, who says that politicians may step away from deregulation because  they view Enron ""like a rotten egg."" Other insiders believe that Enron's  situation may be another reason that Florida's Governor Jeb Bush has postponed  any movement toward deregulation until after his 2002 re-election campaign. Jon  Cartwright, a senior energy analyst with Raymond James & Associates, says  that it will be difficult for deregulation plans to be completely halted, but  Enron is going to give regulators something to think about in addition to  California's problems with deregulation.
Retail Choice Available in Massachusetts
Dominion  Retail Inc. has become the first residential supplier to enter Massachusetts'  near-moribund competitive retail electricity market. Until now, no companies  have attempted to enter the state's retail marketplace. Rob Wilson, a spokesman  from Massachusetts Division of Telecommunications and Energy, said that low  electric rates have made the market unattractive for new power providers. He  also said suppliers were deterred by the nature of the default/standard-offer  system that tends to spread potential customers in the default group over a  broad area. Dominion will offer an alternative choice of power supply to  Massachusetts Electric's 270,000 residential customers who are now receiving  their power on default service. Default customers can receive their power from  Dominion at $66.31 per month if they commit to a three-year deal, which is  slightly less than the $67.75 average cost for Massachusetts Electric default  customers. However, it is still more than the proposed $57.56 per month that an  average Massachusetts Electric standard-offer customer will pay beginning  January 1, 2002, pending state approval. Currently there are already several  companies competing for commercial and industrial customers in the state's  electric marketplace.
 
Consumer Choice Drives Green Power Market
A new  study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Lawrence  Berkeley National Lab's Environmental Energy Technology Division has found that  consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources. If consumers  are given the choice, they will choose power from cleaner sources such as wind,  solar, geothermal, and biomass. The study says that in order for green power to  gain full support in the marketplace, restructuring should proceed without delay  and that market rules in restructured markets should be conducive to  competition. ""Our study shows that giving consumers energy supply choices can be  a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace,"" says  Blair Swezey of NREL, coauthor of the study entitled ""Forecasting the Growth of  Green Power Markets in the United States."" Under the best conditions, use of  green power could grow 40 percent in less than a decade, to a capacity of 7,000  megawatts. However, the study concludes that it is more likely that renewables  will experience a slow growth in the market. In addition to a competitive  marketplace, vigorous promotion and education will also be necessary to ensure  the success of green power.
 
Electricity Bill Will Be Put Off Until Next  Year
The House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee is preparing  an electricity bill that will focus on increasing power supplies and improving  electricity transmission from one part of the country to another. Subcommittee  Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) has not set a date for markup, an aide said, but aims  to consider the bill during the first two weeks of December. Accordingly, Energy  and Commerce Committee Chairman, Billy Tauzin (R-La) announced at a news  conference yesterday that he expects to receive the bill for consideration by  the year's end. Chairman Tauzin told reporters that Congress should allow states  to make their own decisions regarding siting transmission facilities within  their boundaries, but that interstate projects might require Federal  intervention. He also noted that grid connections among states are necessary for  regional transmission organizations as a means to expand the grid and eliminate  electricity bottlenecks. Separately, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD)  is expected to introduce a Senate energy bill that includes an electricity  title, but said that the Senate will not consider it until next  year.
FERC Underestimated Environmental Impacts of  Competition
The final environmental impact statement the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) completed for Order 888 underestimated the  effects that a competitive wholesale power market would have on air pollutants,  a new study says. Synapse Energy Economics, a Massachusetts-based firm, prepared  the study for the commission. It reviewed the accuracy of FERC's predictions on  the effects competition would have on the environment in the year 2000. The most  important conclusion from the analysis is that FERC's modeling methodology was  too narrowly defined to capture the effects, the report says. Synapse found that  FERC did not fully consider the impacts from increases in electricity demand,  improvements in nuclear plant efficiency, and the extension of nuclear and coal  plant lifetimes. The study concludes that FERC's forecast of NOx emissions was  roughly four percent lower than actual experience and its forecast of CO2  emissions was roughly eight percent lower. Also, the report finds that FERC  underestimated actual national electricity demand through 2000 by 4.6 percent.  The North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a panel created  under the North American Free Trade Agreement, was expected to address  these findings and other environmental concerns among the United States, Canada,  and Mexico at a forum held November 29-30, 2001, in San Diego.
Michigan PSC Protects Consumers from Retail  Slamming
The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has  adopted standards to protect retail electric consumers from slamming and  cramming. Slamming is the unauthorized switching from one electric customer from  electric service provider to another, while cramming is the billing of a  customer for unauthorized electric services. The Customer Choice and Reliability  Act of 2000 requires that the Commission issue orders to protect Michigan's  electric customers from slamming and cramming and authorizes the Commission to  conduct contested proceedings to investigate any violations. Under the new  measures, customers may authorize switching of their electric service provider  through written authorization, a call to a toll-free telephone number voice  response unit, a Web-based connection, notice to an appropriately qualified  third party, or a three-way call between the new supplier, the customer, and the  older supplier. New suppliers must notify customers and the existing provider  within seven days of the requested change in service. Violators can be fined up  to $30,000 for the first offense, up to $50,000 for the second offense, and up  to $70,000 for repeated violations.
Michigan PSC Approves Commonwealth Energy as Alternative  Supplier
The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has  approved Commonwealth Energy Corporation's application to sell electric  generation to Michigan retail customers. The commission approved Commonwealth's  license to be the 12th alternative electric supplier in the state under the  Customer Choice and Electricity Reliability Act of 2000. The state regulators  concluded that approval of the alternative electric supplier license would  expand the opportunities for retail electric competition in the state. The  commission granted the license conditioned upon Commonwealth providing electric  service within a reasonable time and indicated that failure to do so may result  in revocation of the license. Commonwealth will operate in Michigan under the  name ElectricAmerica.
Hearing Held on Pennsylvania's Electric  Deregulation
The Pennsylvania House Democratic Policy Committee  held a hearing on electric deregulation on November 28, 2001, during which  witnesses testified on the state's future electricity needs and the impacts of  deregulation. The committee is concerned about whether enough power plants will  be built to meet the state's future demand. Robert Hinkle of PJM  Interconnection, which manages the mid-Atlantic transmission grid and serves as  a wholesale electricity market, said that 4,000 megawatts of increased  electricity capacity are planned for the next three years. With this increase,  the region's capacity would reach 60,000 megawatts, which is more than  sufficient to meet the region's electricity needs for the foreseeable future,  Hinkle said. Richard Maurer, of Local 29 International Brotherhood of Electrical  Workers, testified that deregulation has resulted in layoffs and more burdens on  an increasingly aging work force that his union represents. On the other hand,  Duquesne Light Company President Victor Rogue told the committee that  Pennsylvania's electric deregulation has been a success. Rogue said that  Duquesne Light customers have been protected from steep rate increase and can  expect an estimated 16 percent decline in the rates early next year.
Northeast May See Increased Power Costs
Energy  Security Analysis (ESAI), a Boston-based consulting firm, reports that urban  areas in the Northeast may experience increased power prices unless investments  are made in regional power generation and transmission systems. ESAI director Ed  Krapels said that, while electricity restructuring resulted in new power plant  construction in many states, urban areas remain at risk for higher prices.  ESAI's 10-year power price forecast report for New England says that 2003 and  2004 are ""shaping up as years with premiums close to the double digits in both  on- and off-peak markets"" for the New York Power Pool unless additional power  and transmission are developed. The report also concludes that Boston and  southwestern Connecticut will require additional generation and transmission ""to  keep their urban premiums in check."" The forecast estimates that premiums in the  PJM region could increase by $10 per megawatt should no new generation be  developed. However, new transmission projects will likely stimulate the  development of the new generation projects that are currently stalled. New  generation will help stabilize the New Jersey market as well as contribute to  New York City's power needs.
Ontario Power planning long-term debt offering in new  year
Ontario Power Generation is planning a long-term debt  offering some time next year, the company said yesterday. ""We do intend to tap  the long-term market for the first time next year,"" Ronald Osborne, president  and chief executive officer, told reporters following an industry breakfast in  Toronto. Mr. Osborne could not provide details on the proposed offering, but  said it would most likely be a long-term, or possibly medium-term, issue. This  would be the first long-term debt offering for the company, which was spun off  from debt-ridden Ontario Hydro in the 1990s. Mr. Osborne said the proceeds from  the offering would be used to replace old Ontario Hydro debt that has reached  maturity. By the middle of next year, Ontario Power expects to pay off  $400-million of debt. Ontario Power is one of two main spinoffs of Ontario  Hydro. The other is Hydro One,which is slated to become a publicly traded  company following the planned deregulation of the market next year. Ontario  Power is readying itself for the electricity market to open to competition next  year. The province has already pushed back its original November, 2000, deadline  for electricity-system deregulation by 18 months.
Rates Decrease For Texas Provider of Last  Resort
The Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) and Assurance  Energy have agreed to reduce previously announced rates for guaranteed back-up  electric service in the Houston area and south Texas when retail competition  begins on January 1, 2002. Assurance Energy will be the provider of last resort  (POLR) for residential and small non-residential customers in these areas of  Texas. As a POLR, Assurance is required to assure continued service at a fixed  non-discountable rate to consumers who have been dropped by their current  electric provider. The new prices will be 9.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for  summer months and 7.4 cents per kWh for non-summer months, compared to the  previous respective prices of 12.5 cents per kWh and 9.5 cents per kWh. The  previous agreement was negotiated early this year when the price for natural  gas, a major fuel for generating electricity, reached historical highs.  Currently, natural gas prices are substantially lower.
Louisiana Considers a Limited Deregulation  Plan
The Louisiana Public Service Commission (PSC) is  considering a limited electricity deregulation plan that would allow large  energy consumers to shop for competitive rates. Under the plan, companies that  use five megawatts or more of energy would be allowed the option of leaving the  regulated market every two years starting in 2003. The proposed plan does not  include retail competition for residential or small business consumers. Not all  commissioners support the plan, however; Commissioner Don Owen has said that he  does not think deregulation will benefit electricity users in the state.  Opposition to the proposal has also come from the Louisiana Energy Users Group  (LEUG) and the Louisiana Midcontinent Oil and Gas Association, which maintain  that large industrial users should be given the choice to leave the market  annually. The groups also argue that the plan hampers large industrial customers  from building cogeneration plants because of a provision that requires large  industrial cogenerators to pay a stranded costs recovery fee. Industrial  customers with new cogeneration facilities are allowed to apply for an  exemption. The PSC has not yet determined the stranded cost fee structure under  the proposed deregulation plan. David Dismukes, an associate professor of energy  studies at Louisiana State University, says that this uncertainty may make  companies hesitant to build cogeneration plants. State regulators had included  the fee in the proposed plan so that stranded cost recovery would not be  unfairly shifted to residential ratepayers who remain in the regulated system.  The PSC is scheduled to vote on the plan next month.
Deregulation in Mississippi Not Expected Soon
In a  recent speech to the Vicksburg Civic Club, Public Service Commissioner Nielsen  Cochran said it is unlikely that Mississippi will soon open its electricity  market to competition. Cochran explained that, in order for competition or  deregulation to work, there must be a greater abundance of generation options in  the state. After two years of hearings that ended in 1999, the Public Service  Commission advised lawmakers that Mississippi was not ready for deregulation.  Cochran said that deregulation would result in more expensive electricity rates  for consumers across the state.
Texas Electricity Provider Opposes Texas Deregulation  Delay
The New Power Company, an electricity provider that is  participating in Texas' pilot deregulation program, said that it opposes  delaying the January 1, 2002, start of electricity deregulation. New Power has  been a major player in the pilot program, but has experienced its share of  obstacles along the way. Computer glitches have caused the company to send out  customer bills late and at times without appropriate charges. Representatives  from the company say that the company needs information from companies that  operate the electricity transmission and metering systems in order to issue  accurate bills. New Power and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which  is responsible for making the information available, have been communicating to  improve the situation. New Power is confident that its problems will be resolved  in time for the January 1, 2002, deregulation date. The Public Utility  Commission requested comments from electricity companies on whether the state  should move the date back from January 1, 2002.
New California crisis: Too much electricity
A man  approaches a woman in a grocery-store aisle and asks whether she would rather  have dinner with him tonight. Sorry, she replies, she'll be doing her laundry  late this evening. And not tomorrow night, either, because she'll be doing her  vacuuming in those off-peak hours. Energy conservation, you know. Californians  have been forced to watch this state government TV commercial over and over in  recent months, but are now rolling their eyes at its outdated message. The  Governor ordered the ads advocating radical energy conservation after an  unprecedented wave of blackouts that plagued the state earlier this year. But if  ads were being ordered now, they might suggest that Californians turn on extra  lights, plug in some heavy appliances and run their air conditioners at full  blast. In only a few months, California has gone from an energy drought to a  flood, in which the state is now forced to sell or give away a glut of excess  electricity at prices far below those it paid. California's double-whammy energy  crisis -- a shortage followed by an overstock -- serves as a cautionary tale for  other jurisdictions looking to privatize their utilities.  California led  the way in placing its electricity on the open market, and last year fell prey  to what some describe as a failure in its regulatory structure, and what  Governor Grey Davis calls ""a monumental scam"" committed by power-generating  companies against the state. One thing is certain: When electricity demand was  driven up by poor weather last January, generators began charging the state  prices hundreds of times more than what it had paid only months before. Because  California bought its power on a day-by-day basis, prices fluctuated  dramatically: One generator billed the state $3,880 (U.S.) for a megawatt that  had cost $29 the previous year. And because most of the state's utilities had  capped domestic rates, the price increase had to be borne by the state treasury.  Mr. Davis now claims that the state is owed a refund of more than $9-billion  from those generators. Federal regulators agree with him, although the amount of  the refund still must be negotiated. However, the crisis left the state with  debts in the tens of billions of dollars, consumer electrical rates were raised  by 43 per cent and people were terrified by days of rolling, random blackouts  that threatened to drive businesses away from California's already beleaguered  economy. Now Mr. Davis is coming under fire for his solution to that crisis: As  the blackouts were taking place, he signed $43-billion worth of long-term power  contracts, some of them for many years, at rates averaging $69 a megawatt. These  seemed to provide stability, but now they seem onerous: With demand for oil and  natural gas dropping in the wake of Sept. 11, rosy weather forecasts and dozens  of new generating stations coming on line, open-market energy prices have  dropped below $20 a megawatt. Suddenly, California faces the prospect of paying  tens of billions of dollars a year above market rates for electricity. ""Our  children and grandchildren will be the ones who have to pay for his mistakes,""  said Richard Riordan, former mayor of Los Angeles and Mr. Davis's chief  Republican opponent. To make matters worse, those energy-conservation TV ads  appear to have worked too well. Californians are now using less electricity per  capita than any other state. While this is applauded by utility officials and  environmentalists, it leaves California with contracts for far more electricity  than it needs. Energy companies, which had rushed in to build or upgrade power  plants during this year's crisis, have been scaling back dramatically. Since  September, at least half a dozen planned generating stations have been  cancelled. But experts warn that this, too, could backfire, warning that  California could be hit by another round of blackouts in five years.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts","Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

"FW: B of A setoff provisions","   fyi                        [Murray, Julia]  




 Original Message-----
From: 	Ephross, Joel  
Sent:	Monday, November  26, 2001 12:43 PM
To:	Murray, Julia
Cc:	Mintz, Jordan
Subject:	B of A setoff provisions

According to Mary, we do not have a written agreement with B of A. Notwithstanding that, from time to time B of A sends out standard Ts and Cs regarding corporate accounts. The last one available, effective October 2001, contains a setoff provision. This purports to allow the bank a right of setoff, either before or after an event of default, and to apply both to the bank, and its affiliates. [It does not purport to apply to the debtor or any of its affiliates, except in circumstances not applicable here -- such as sole proprietor, or partnership situations.]

Please find the analysis for Ontario.  I would like to highlight Guillermo's conclusion.  To quote ""As a BBB rated company, Enron should have been provided an allowable reduction in prudential support of $5 million.  According to the market rules (section 5.8.2), the announcement of being placed on ""credit watch"" would result in Enron being automatically downgraded to below BBB, which means that Enron no longer qualifies for an allowable reduction. Enron would need to replace the $5 million with additional prudential support within five business days.""  

Please let me know if you have any question.

David,

I have provided you with the two original copies that I have for the HGP contract.

If you need to see the historical contracts, please let me know

Right now they have provided us with an invoice for that expenses that were owed.  Enron has paid the portion that was filed with them and we are now waiting and trying to locate the current location of the payment that we have submitted to UBSW Energy. They had told us that the had cut the check on Feb 20th but HGP has not received it yet. 

I would like to see the contract signed off as soon as possible, so please let me know when you can get to it

Also please let me know if Kevin needs to initial it before you look at it.  He has not done so currently and I can not remember the process that we had used in the past. 


Thank You for your help

(""AEPESI""). Gas and power receivables financing notifications were made to Ephross et al, Cash et al. this afternoon.  Execution of Master Netting Agr. must be preceded by AEP and EPMI's execution of an amendment (""Amendment"") to power master agreements instituting margining solely as to EPMI, which Amendment is resolved except for the $ figure to be placed on the collateral threshhold. Elizabeth Sager on standby to take this to completion if execution is to take place this evening.

"RE: Master Netting agmt.:  AEP","Jason -- Please note that (1) there is a 1/1/98 GISB in effect between AEP Services, Inc and ENA following assignment of such GISB by Columbia Energy Marketing to ENA under a Nov. 22, 1999 Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Such GISB is referenced in the current draft Netting Agreement currently under AEP's review.  (2) The wholesale power trading masters identified and referenced in the current draft Netting Agreement are a Power Sales Agreement dated as of September 29, 1997  providing for sales of wholesale electric power by EPMI to AEP, and a Service Agreement dated as of March 30, 1998 under the AEP Companies' Wholesale Market Tariff, providing for sales of wholesale electric power by AEP to EPMI.  (3) You indicated below that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  These relationships would be pulled in by the Master Netting Agreement's catch-all Recital defining ""Other Agreements""  unless Credit determines with AEP that these trading relationships are to be excluded, and language is added to that effect. -  David

"RE: Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts","This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the issue of Transportation Contract rejection with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews and Kurth.  He and his partner Jeff Spiers have been advising other Enron divisions regarding the contract rejection process.  

I am told that a motion has been filed with the bankruptcy court requesting that shorthand procedures be established for the purpose of allowing the various Enron Debtors to reject executory contracts.  That motion is apparently slated to be heard on January 7.  The attached template describes the information that must be filed with the court and forwarded to the creditors' committee and to the relevant counterparty whose contract is being rejected.  Assuming that the order is approved, we'll be able to start rejecting transportation contracts as early as January 8.  

Kelli and Maria,

In order to expedite the process, could you please fill out the attached template, providing the information requested. 

Please call with any questions.

Thanks for your help.

I imagine that we will need full company names, contact persons and addresses in order to place the different pipes on notice of the motion to reject.  Could you please coordinate the gathering of this information so that we will be in a position to act on it as soon as possible after New Years?  Thanks for your help.

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

"Wires Today","Tim,

I believe we will have five large wires today.  Four will be for power prepayments in the west (we already have two, and are waiting on the last two), and one will be to NEPOOL to maintain our three-day rolling prepay (this keeps us alive in NEPOOL).  Evelyn Aucoin is pulling them together right now, and hopefully we will have all five to you before noon.

The wires in the West should hold us over until next week.  We will have another wire to NEPOOL tomorrow, which we will do early in the morning.

Thanks,

Don

Here is a draft form of officers certificate for your review.  As we discussed, I wanted to get you something to look at as soon as possible.  With the holidays upon us, I still have not been able to clear this through all of the necessary channels but will continue to try.  Call with any questions/comments. Thanks

"CALIFORNIA REFUND PROCEEDING STAYED INDEFINITELY","FERC issued an order this morning staying indefinitely the California Refund proceeding.  In its order (attached), FERC notes that many requests for rehearing are pending and FERC intends to act on those requests soon.  FERC states that if it were to grant rehearing, it could affect the refund calculations being determined in the hearing proceeding, so FERC is staying the hearing proceeding until further order from the Commission.

While we don't know what FERC will say on hearing, it is very likely that the rehearing order will be a significant departure from the July 25 order.  We will let you know of any further developments.  If you have any questions, please let me know (202) 466-9160.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

The SPP policy states that if a cp experiences a debt downgrade or negative watch, a cp must give SPP notice.  We need to give notice of downgrade/neg watch if we haven't done so already.

Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) continues to make changes to its Credit 
Policy to reflect changes in overall market conditions. The current Credit 
Policy was posted on our web site on November 14, 2001. It reflects a marked 
shift in the way SPP has administered its Credit Policy in the past. 

SPP wants all of our customers to be made aware of this change and we want 
to give each  a certain period of time to make the necessary adjustments in 
any areas that may be necessary. To this end SPP is attaching the new Credit 
Policy for your review. We ask that it be directed to the proper person 
within your organization to assure that your company is compliant with all 
conditions of the Credit Policy. We ask that you also complete the attached 
Credit Agreement and return it to SPP as soon as possible. 

SPP expects all customers to be compliant with the Credit Policy by December 
15, 2001. Please review the Credit Policy and take the necessary steps to be 
in compliance by that date so that there are no interruptions of service or 
your ability to make future reservations. 

If you have any questions concerning the new policy please feel free to 
contact me.  I look forward to working with you to make these changes as 
smooth as possible.

"HYDA Index -2","
Monday   -2

The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Tuesday, November 20 is  -2.

The bad news contained in the 10Q did not lead to an immediate junk bond downgrade.  This implies that Mr. Banker,  who lent us the  $9b that, (surprise!),  we have to pay back so soon,  has been able to persuade Mr. Credit Rater to stay his release of the raised guillotine a day longer, permitting us, we hope, to withdraw our neck from the block and continue to negotiate with Mr. Banker for the vintage Enron ""blend and extend"" package. 

Amidst much crow activity up and down the river, a single large specie was seen flying due north with a large tuft of something clasped in his beak,  followed by a rapacious sea gull in hot pursuit.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

On item no. 1, as you and I just confirmed with Michelle Bruce, the $958,000 owed by Vitol to EGLI due on 11/29/01 has not been paid. We are pulling the sale confirmation to see what the payment terms are. I have left a voice mail for Tom Moran who was travelling to NY today to learn where the l/c is so it can be reviewed for drawing requirements. We'll have to revisit about this on Wednesday, Dec 26 assuming we hear back from Tom.

Is there anyone else from Credit who can get us access to the l/c?

Subject:	Summary of LC Issues
Importance:	High

Here is where I understand things stand based on our discussions this morning:

1.	Vitol SA - Tom Moran sent an e-mail to Mark Leskowitz asking if Vitol has paid Enron.  I have not heard from Mark or Tom.  The LC expires on 12/28.

2.	El Paso - I just sent an e-mail summarizing the netting situation.  If the netting was proper then our only grounds for drawing is failure to renew the LC.  We sent them a letter yesterday about this.  Credit was going to contact them.  We can draw as early as next Wednesday.

3.	Great Bay - same as El Paso absent the netting issue.

4.	LG&E Energy Marketing - they owe us  a payment next Wednesday.  We will wait to see if they have paid and if they haven't we can declare them in default and draw.  If they have, we can draw based on a failure to renew the LC.


5.	Enserco - I will draft for Monica a follow up letter to send to them.  Credit will begin calculating Exposure/termination Amounts in anticipation of a termination as of Thursday, December 27th.  The letter today will give them until Wednesday to renew.

6.	Niagra Mohawk/ENA, Metromedia energy/ENA, Simpson Tacoma/ENA, The Energy Authority/ENA, Energy Production/ENA, Rising Star Energy LLC/ENA - I am waiting on payment history info from Leslie to see if we have any right to draw.   Could someone in credit confirm that we are in-the-money on all of these?

7.	City of Santa Clara - Harlan to send out default notice.

We have filed a heads of terms with FERC today which envisages that we will enter into a fully termed agreement next week in which EPMI, EES and EEMC will pre-pay for a rolling three day period starting 27 December for all energy and other services in NEPOOL. NEPOOL will provide an estimate of such costs and expenses by 12.00 a.m. on 26 December and the money will need to be wired to the nominated account, details of which are set out below, by 04:00 p.m. eastern standard time the following Business Day This will occur every Business Day and we therfore need to be set up to wire the amounts of money demanded. It should be noted that NEPOOL require that there be at least three days pre-paid at all times.

There will be a reconciliation at the end of every month. We do have the flexibility to pre-pay for more than three days if it is deemed expedient or prudent to do so. 
	
Leslie Reeves and Wade Stubblefield will be responsible for ensuring that the monies are wired in a timely manner.

"RE: B of A setoff provisions","Julia and Liz:
I reviewed the ISDA agreements with B of A, one with Enron Corp. and one with ENA.  The one with Enron Corp. does not have a ratings trigger and as we discussed, there is no financial statement rep.  The one with ENA does have a ratings trigger (below BBB- by S&P and below Baa3 by Moody's).  The ratings trigger is both an Event of Default (curable by posting collateral) and an event that lowers the collateral threshold to zero.  Setoff rights are triggerrred upon the designation of an early termination date and only extend to agreements between ENA and B of A.

Subject:	B of A setoff provisions

According to Mary, we do not have a written agreement with B of A. Notwithstanding that, from time to time B of A sends out standard Ts and Cs regarding corporate accounts. The last one available, effective October 2001, contains a setoff provision. This purports to allow the bank a right of setoff, either before or after an event of default, and to apply both to the bank, and its affiliates. [It does not purport to apply to the debtor or any of its affiliates, except in circumstances not applicable here -- such as sole proprietor, or partnership situations.]

"NEPOOL","Jim
	
Speaking with Don Miller last night he has indicated that Jeff McMahon would like to secure our membership and ongoing participation in NEPOOL and possibly other Pools, and is prepared to make cash available through the Cash Committee.
	
While we discussed a number of options, the starting point is to identify the contracts that are in the money to EPMI and which have not yet been terminated. The long term deals that we have been looking at in NEPOOL are NSTAR, UI and CMP. We are getting closer to an acceptable internal valuation of these and need to get a ""robust"" number that we can defend in order to release cash from the Cash Committee.
	
The three main cash related issues we need to address as I see it in the short term are: (1) We must provide NEPOOL with the comfort, possibly even in the form of a pre-pay, that we will pay our invoices for November, especially since the bonds we posted terminate on 29, December (2) We must provide cash collateral immediately and (3) We will need pay our NEPOOL invoices over a two, or possibly, one week period to reduce NEPOOL's exposure to EPMI. This creates cash flow issues as we are only paid monthly by our customers. With the one way payment issue we are facing with NSTAR and UI there is clearly little incentive for them to re-negotiate their contracts.
	
Turning to point (2), it is not clear to me whether we will be able to post the $137,390,360.10 and I will assume that we will not get the authority to post this but a lesser amount. In trying to provide NEPOOL with comfort as to their exposures it may be that we can get them to agree that for the foreseeable future we will only be serving certain contracts and that the collateral requirement be based solely on EPMI serving those contracts. I am not confident however that NEPOOL has the authority to what is in effect change the Financial Assurance Policy for one Participant, without approval of all Participants and approval of FERC, but we can explore this with them.

If the price of energy, ICAP and other services moves up then EPMI should be given a reasonable period of time to post further collateral. That way we can hopefully reduce the initial amount we post and if the price moves up we can elect at that point whether to retain our membership or relinquish it. While EPMI will be taking market risk, which ill not be hedged, it will have the ability to stop performing f the price moves against it. It should not be forgotten that both the NSTAR and UI deals are one way payments and there is no time limit as to when either of these counterparties can claim a default due to EPMI's bankruptcy. The effect of this being that we are at risk from a termination by these two counterparties at any time and since we are currently the ""Defaulting Party"" we would not receive any Early Termination Payment. CMP is a two way payment and therefore there may well be some merit in entering into a term energy purchase deal to lock in value to this contract.
	
I am not aware of what EES is trying to do with NEPOOL, or the other pools in the North East, however I thought it would be helpful if they knew what we were trying to do and why. Any input as to what EES is doing and any merit in a joint approach could be explored if both companies considered value could be achieved.
	
Finally, the recipients of this email will hopefully know of other people, for example in credit, scheduling and settlements who could assist in ensuring that we can accurately value and schedule the contracts we would like to continue performing under, please pass these on to Don Miller who is coordinating this initiative.
	
Regards,
	
Marcus

Danielle,

Thank you for the invitation to discuss scheduling activities for the month of August. As I am sure you are aware this company is undergoing a significant period of turmoil. It would therefore be of great help if you could send a list of specific questions so that we may be able to answer them directly.

If it would aid your understanding of our activity, we have full requirement obligations in both the North and South zones that were to ramp up starting in July. This load was to reach in excess of 100 MW by September. However, the speed of switching and the location of this load were not known. In addition, we have resources off 2 power plants, both located in the South. One of these plants is consistently subjected to various types of command and control dispatch by the ISO and we are obligated to find a market for any residual energy. 

I trust this paints a picture of what we do and can help clarify any questions you may have. At this time, I do not feel we are in a position to comment on the actions of other QSEs as any information we have would be purely anecdotal.

I trust all is well,

Doug Gilbert-Smith
Director, Ercot Trading

"RE: NEPOOL","Woody
	
I would hope that we can reach an agreement with NEPOOL by late this week, which will mean that we will pay our post-petition costs and expenses into an escrow account to be released once FERC have approved the Standstill Agreement we are currently negotiating. This will require us to pre-pay for three days in advance and we will be billed daily, if we fail to pay any monies, we will be immediately suspended from NEPOOL and termination proceedings with the FERC will be instigated.
	
This arrangement is likely to remain in place until the 15 February, 2002, when the NEPOOL membership will review the same and can at that point decide whether we will need to comply with the Financial Assurance Policy in place. This Standstill Agreement should be viewed as a special exception to the Financial Assurance Policy to enable Enron entities to continue to trade and it could be said that once approved we are in compliance until the 15 February. 

The Standstill Agreement, when agreed, will be filed at FERC and will be available for comment by all NEPOOL participants, the terms will be public soon. However,
until then, I would simply advise any customers that we are in ongoing negotiations with NEPOOL and that we are currently pre-paying for energy and ancillary services from NEPOOL.

"Enron Energy Marketing Corp.","Vicki
	
Enron Energy Marketing Corp.(""EEMC"") has bonds posted with the ISO New England (""ISO-NE"") with a value of $14,423,297.39. I am led to believe that this entity is an Enron Energy Services, Inc. (""EESI"") entity which bought some assets from PG&E, possibly.

In order to maximise our credit flexibility and minimise our collateral obligations would you be kind enough to advise as to whether this entity is trading or requires NEPOOL to fulfill any obligations to customers and if not, we would want to cancel the bond.

If indeed the bond is needed, could you see if there is a way to transfer the obligations which require the bond to be in place for EEMC, from EEMC to EESI, in order that we can position ourselves to cancel the bond. In respect of any such transfer we would want to ensure that there was no increase in the obligation upon EESI as to the amount of the bonds required to be posted. EESI currently has $20,000,000 in bonds posted with ISO-NE. 
	
If ISO-NE required the amount of the bonds to be increased, in the event that the obligations of EEMC were transferred to EESI, Travis, please could you advise as to whether the DIP financing agreements will permit us to issue new bonds, if the net effect was to reduce the amount of bonds issued as between all Enron entities.

As we discussed, we  would like to notify our customers of our current status and our ability to look after them.  Here is a brief summary of the services contracts and obligations that we currently have along with the notification letter we would like to send them.  Please let us know if we are ok to send these out.

Thanks,

MDEA
purchase power for the cities
purchase and schedule gas as agent to supply the cities generating units
real-time operational coordination via our control room to balance the cities load and resources

MDEA relies entirely on EPMI for this as they have no other enabling agreements or marketing/scheduling capability.  We are no longer able to purchase power for them but are able to schedule gas as their agent.  The sities could incur signifigant imbalance charges as a result of our inability to perform.

 << File: Credit Status.doc >> 

QSE Customers

Green Mountain Power (BP Energy), New Power Company, XERS (starts Jan 1) 

We schedule all power contracts with ERCOT
We settle all charges and payments with ERCOT (ERCOT settles with EPMI and EPMI settles with customer)

 << File: New Power QSE Default Notification.doc >> 

Frontera

We market the output of the Frontera plant (450 MW) 
We buy to suppy Frontera's obligations (call options to EPMI and Mirant) when the market is below Frontera's cost.
We schedule all transactions as QSE

Frontera has no other enabling agreements and relies on EPMI for all trading activities.

We have 5 days to deliver (some flexibility to view it as 5 business days).  The margin call is for $4,283,512.  It is to cover NIMO for settlement and imbalance risk for EES participation in their ""Supplier Select"" program.

Subject:	NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security

	Molly:

	Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's ""Supplier Select"" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted ""as financial evaluations dictate"". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as ""BBB"" from S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii) the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2.  

	In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an ""A"" bond rating; (iii) a security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least ""BBB"" by S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

	Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional information.

	MLC

Subject:	NYISO collateral due FRIDAY 12/7 

Wade,

In order for EES to participate in the Monthly ICAP Auction on 12/13, we need to wire cash collateral of $750,000 to NYISO by COB Friday 12/7.  The cash collateral must be adequate to allow the amount of ICAP we need to clear in the market (or we will be exposed to the Monthly Deficiency Auction -- which could be much higher than the ""regular"" Monthly Auction).   Our Physical Delivery Load will increase significantly starting 01/01/02 (and stabilize, thereafter) to ~ 70 MW.  

In addition, NYISO is offsetting the cash collateral of $680,000 that was wired to them last Friday against previous month's Energy and ICAP bills.  While we can attempt to technically argue against this offset due to the bankruptcy, the loss of status to continue transacting with the NYISO will violate the reps in our customer agreements, and, thus, risk the validity of the book (est.  $60MM).  The calculation of the offset is below.  Therefore, we will then need to wire additional collateral of $760,500 by COB TUES. 12/11 (based on 3 X highest month of $235,500 (Nov. 01)).  Keep in mind that the collateral for Energy will increase even more in January due to our increase in Load, as previously mentioned.

  $680,000 Collateral sent 11/30 (Friday)
  (255,000) Nov. Energy bill (will be sent 12/7--due 12/17)
  (125,000) Nov. ICAP bill (same)

  (127,000)  Dec. ICAP bill (due 1/02)

 $141,000 left will be kept by NYISO until it is certain that true-ups from past invoices are complete (which can take awhile for this ISO).

Electricity Restructuring Gets Push  From Republicans
Republican members of the Energy and Air  Quality Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have agreed with  Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, that restructuring legislation should  move forward now that Congress has a few more weeks in session. In an 8-2 vote  last week, Republican Committee members decided to continue drafting electricity  restructuring legislation. Electricity restructuring provisions were excluded  from the energy bill approved by the House earlier this year. The issue was to  be readdressed in the fall but was delayed due to the events on September 11th.  No action has been taken to date in the Senate.
Green Mountain Energy Expands Into  Ohio's Restructured Market
Green Mountain Energy Company has  entered into an agreement with the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council (NOPEC)  to service northeastern Ohio with solar and wind-generated electricity. NOPEC  was formed last year under Ohio's utility deregulation statute Senate Bill 3,  which allows local governments to serve as aggregators for electricity  customers. NOPEC consists of 100 local communities with approximately 500,000  energy customers. Under the agreement, Green Mountain Energy will construct a  25-kilowatt solar array at Lake Farmpark in Kirtland, Ohio, and will conduct a  study to determine the feasibility of siting a wind generating facility in Ohio.  The Green Mountain Energy solar array will be the largest in the state and the  first commercial solar array in Ohio built for the competitive market. The  proposed wind study will be the first commercial wind analysis executed solely  for the competitive market.
Debate Over Deregulation Impacts in  Oklahoma
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has reported, in a  first-of-its kind study, that restructuring Oklahoma's electric industry can  benefit consumers, but problems and potential pitfalls do exist. The report has  been met with some opposition however. Pete Churchwell, president of Oklahoma's  second largest electric utility AEP/PSO, stated on November 16th that he does  not support the study's findings, one of which indicates that Oklahoma's energy  costs could rise between 5 and 25 percent if the retail electricity market is  opened to competition. The study results indicate that lower electric prices may  be available in the short term, but restructuring will ultimately bring higher  prices. Under the state's restructuring plan, existing generating plants will  have a competitive advantage over new plants. This advantage will result in  higher prices in the long term because newer, higher-cost plants may be forced  out of the marketplace. Churchwell contests that it is too early to know for  certain how consumer rates will react in a deregulated market. While admitting  that the nation's grid was not designed for retail competition, Churchwell said  that improvements in state transmission systems would allow a successful retail  competitive market.
Utility still looks to be freed of  generators
Clark Public Utilities has been trying in vain for  two months to unload some of the 50 portable generators that have become a  multimillion-dollar white elephant.  The units, wired in rows near the  River Road Generating Plant, were leased for a year for $19.5 million. The deal  was signed with General Electric early this year, at a time when there were dire  predictions about this summer's power supply.  In addition to the equipment  lease, there is a $15 million natural gas contract to power the generators and a  roughly $12 million expense to transport the gas. While Clark has been able to  resell some of the gas at a loss, the transportation costs can't be  recouped.  For weeks, electricity on the open market has been much cheaper  than that produced by the generators.  In place since July, the generators,  each producing 1 megawatt of power, have run for just 39 days.  Electricity  prices have plunged, from a high of $325 per megawatt-hour this summer to less  than $30 today. The price has to be about $95 to make operating the generators  feasible. So utility officials have had no choice but to let them sit  idle.  In September, the net expense for the generator farm gas, generator  lease and so on was $3.5 million. For no electricity.  Utility officials  have tried to get GE to find customers for at least some of the  generators.  Tuesday morning, Andy Huck, Clark's operations director, said  he had heard from GE about a ""pretty serious inquiry"" for two generators for two  months. And that, he said, ""is the best inquiry they've had so far.""  Now,  utility officials are trying to decide whether to keep spending $62,000 a month  for three GE employees and other expenses associated with maintaining the  generators.  The theory is that the equipment should be tested, a few at a  time, to ensure they will be ready if needed.  ""They told me the generators  need to be 'exercised,'"" said Huck. ""I told them they spent two months on a ship  without being started."" The units were built in Austria.  GE, with a signed  one-year lease in hand, has little incentive to find customers for the  equipment, particularly when the company could presumably lease other generators  from its inventory.  ""They say it's because we're such good client"" that an  effort has been made to find other users for the generators, said Huck. Clark's  $120 million River Road generating plant features a giant GE turbine.   Clark officials don't hold out much hope of getting out from under the generator  lease expense, which runs about $1.3 million per month. ""Where would they go?""  asked Jim Sanders, Clark's director of energy resources.  Meanwhile, the  natural gas supply for the equipment is being resold at about half what it cost  the utility. Gas prices also have fallen since the supply deal was inked.   At their regular Tuesday meeting, utility commissioners decided to proceed with  a $100 million bond sale that includes money to pay for the generator  lease.  In March, Rick Dyer, Clark's finance director, recommended that the  utility cut a deal for a one-year, $100 million ""bond anticipation note."" The  arrangement was made on the assumption that interest rates would fall in a few  months, which they have to 1961 levels.  The move Tuesday gave Dyer and  utility General Manager Wayne Nelson the OK to approve a bond sale of up to 15  years at 6 percent interest although 5 percent or less is more likely, and the  goal is a 10-year term, officials said.  The bond sale likely will occur in  the first week of December. The bulk of the $100 million borrowing is to cover a  $63 million power purchase from Kaiser Aluminum. The deal, like the generator  lease, was for power to cover an August-September gap in Clark's power supply,  before the start of a Bonneville Power Administration contract.  That  Kaiser purchase was at $325 a megawatt-hour. The utility lost a bid to have a  federal judge declare the price exorbitant and order a partial refund.     
AEP, Reliant Named as Last Resort  Providers in Texas
The Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) has  named American Electric Power (AEP) and Reliant Resources affiliates ""providers  of last resort"" (POLR) for residential and small-commercial customers in all or  part of 96 counties within TXU Electric's service area. The POLR becomes the  electricity provider for customers who have been dropped by their past provider  due to payment problems or if their provider has discontinued service in their s  area. AEP and Reliant will offer a retail price that is expected to be 30-34  percent higher than base rates in the area taking effect January 1, 2002. By  becoming the POLR, AEP and Reliant will acquire an additional 2 million  Dallas-area customers and an expected 1-20 percent load increase. Due to the  higher costs associated with such an increased load the PUC was agreeable to the  higher rate. Consumer groups are opposing the higher rates, saying that  low-income consumers will be unfairly hurt. Although many low-income consumers  will qualify for a 10 percent discount advocates are arguing that POLR rates  should equal the regular rates.
Studies Show Changing Consumer Views  Towards Deregulation
A recent study by Deloitte and Touche  Energy Resources Group finds that consumers are less aware of deregulation in  the electric industry and more wary of its potential benefits. The survey  considered the opinions of 657 consumers nationwide and found that the number of  consumers who are aware of changes in retail electric markets has dropped to  39.7 percent, compared with 50.5 percent in 2000. This is a reversal in a  five-year trend of increasing consumer awareness on deregulation. Analysts cited  the terrorist attacks and the lack of federal legislation or debate on  deregulation as reasons for the change. The survey also found that more  consumers expect electric rates to increase with deregulation. Deloitte and  Touche's Brank Terzi reports that a third of consumers expect no benefit from  competition, while 26 percent expect prices to go down, 9 percent expect  improved service, and 15 percent simply ""don't know."" Another study completed by  RKS Research and Consulting similarly found that many consumers feel that  ""deregulation has been a colossal failure."" Their study found that many  consumers who have switched to new service providers have been disappointed  because their service expectations were not met. RKS Senior Vice President  Carmine Grastataro said, ""customers of public power are more satisfied with the  job their utility is doing than are customers of the IOUs. Although this finding  has historically remained true, the difference in performance scores between  public power and IOUs is exacerbated in states where competition is under way.""  The study also found that consumers are more interested in purchasing power  through buying groups, voluntary energy curtailment programs, and on-site  generation.
FERC Postpones December 15 RTO  Deadline
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has  officially decided to postpone the December 15, 2001, deadline for utilities to  create four regional transmission organizations (RTO). FERC Chairman Pat Wood  said of the decision, ""RTO development is in very different stages in various  parts of the country, and it is not possible for all RTOs to be in operation by  the December 15, 2001, deadline established in Order 2000."" The commission has  approved a rulemaking order, RM01-12, that addresses the development of RTOs in  several steps. First, the Commission will develop a broader definition of the  expected functions of an RTO and how they can be achieved. Second, FERC will  seek improved input and communication from both state and federal agencies on  RTO development. Third, FERC will conduct a formal cost benefit analysis of RTO  systems. This comes in response to two conflicting studies: NY ISO reports that  a large Northeast RTO could cause power rates to increase by $90 million, while  Mirant contends that a Northeast RTO could save consumers $440 million. The  rulemaking also calls for FERC to determine areas in which standardization can  be improved. Lastly, a new ""progressive"" timeline will be developed that  addresses RTO development in a region-by-region approach. While Chairman Wood  said that the commission is holding to its original concept of four RTOs, he  also noted that the new order suggests that three smaller RTOs may be developed  within the Western region. These transmission groups would include RTO West,  Desert Star RTO, and one based on the California ISO. The rulemaking also makes  a call for comments in what Commissioner Nora Brownell noted as possibly the  last opportunity for market participants and state regulators to make  suggestions and raise concerns before final orders are issued.
Ontario deregulation in  doubt 
The planned  deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in  doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity  transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an  open North American power market. The plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike  Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a  not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this  happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make  acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's  premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive  officer Eleanor Clitheroe. David Lindsay, the president and chief executive  officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser,  confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to  Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration.  ""We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this  one,"" he said yesterday. He would not provide details, though it is thought that  the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership  structure by the conclusion of the year. A senior official in the Ontario  government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal ""is a step  backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro."" He was referring to the debt-laden  utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating  arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans  30,000 kilometres. The Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for  Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that ""there are a number of options on  the table."" Sources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning  Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the  chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest  dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion  through the sale of bonds to investors. The dealers' commission on the sale of  the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would  range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said. Mr. Harris  is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to  the government to help pay down the $21-billion in ""stranded debt"" racked up by  the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long  spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the  province's balance sheet. Hydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to  electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of  bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One  lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company  instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The  United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial  risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders. Executives at RBC  Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality  concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring. The  government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and  sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated  turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent  owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the  leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would  be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public  offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the  stock exchange. The third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit  organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option,  though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of  which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would  eventually become a commercial enterprise. Sources said that Hydro One  management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One  the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The  not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises  potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies  might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive  advantage. It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially  lucrative share options.  Rod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president,  would not comment on the not-for-profitoption being contemplated by the  government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability  to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market.  ""Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in  the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,"" he said  in a phone interview. Stanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall  Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a  not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser  to Hydro One's strategic business plan). In a three-page letter sent this week  to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said  that ""this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario."" He argued that ""the  absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit  corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers."" He also  said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to  invest in ""new bottleneck-eliminating connections"" that would allow the company  to become a significant electricity exporter. ""Ontario would lose the prospect  of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,"" he said. In a  recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote,  ""With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well  positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United  States, where ownership tends to be fragmented."" He noted that Hydro One is  expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has  ""the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into  competitive high-growth initiatives."" According to sources familiar with the  not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of  all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from  corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper  companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the  board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers.  Restructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the  most efficient way to capitalize the company. ""The problem with a Canadian  National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,"" said  one financier familiar with the proposal. ""With a debt-based structure, every  dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure  means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt  payments."" Dofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about  $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord  Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's  stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity  charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to  whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year.  ""We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,"" Mr. Forstner said. ""Until  that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding  outside of Ontario's boundaries.""
Retail Access Requested in  California
The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) has  asked the California Supreme Court to overturn the state Public Utilities  Commission's September 20th decision that suspended direct retail access across  the state. The consumer group, comprised of American Utility Network, the  Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, California League of Food Processors,  Western Power Trading Forum, Strategic Energy, AB&I Foundry, Tricon Global  Restaurants and School Project for Utility Rate Reduction, has argued that the  ruling was made without due process and that the Court had no right to abrogate  contracts retroactively. ""It is our hope that the Supreme Court recognizes the  PUC has acted in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and has rushed  to judgment on this issue, without hearings and without creating a proper  evidentiary record,"" said AReM Attorney Dan Douglass. PUC Commissioner Carl Wood  has maintained that the PUC issued the order because it believed that consumers  have hastily signed contracts with competitive suppliers, leaving fewer  customers to pay for the state's wholesale power costs. AReM is disputing the  claim, saying that only a limited number of customers switched suppliers during  the summer of 2001.
Plant Construction Influences  Florida's Wholesale Market
California based Calpine Corporation  announced that it has begun construction of a 530 megawatt power plant in  Auburndale, Florida. The construction brings Florida closer to deregulation, as  Calpine is one of the few out-of-state generating companies to successfully  penetrate Florida's wholesale electricity market. Other companies, such as  Enron, have attempted to construct new power plants in the state, but have been  unsuccessful due to community and regulatory resistance. Florida's stringent  Power Plant Siting Act makes it very difficult for out-of-state companies to  enter the market. Calpine has succeeded by agreeing to sell the output from the  Auburndale plant under a long-term contract to one of Florida's existing  utilities, Seminole Electric Cooperative. In addition, Calpine has been working  with the Florida Partnership for Affordable Competitive Electricity to persuade  lawmakers and Governor Bush to deregulate Florida's wholesale market. Florida's  Energy 2020 Study Commission, which is responsible for the state's competition  plan, has endorsed a proposal to allow out-of-state companies to enter Florida's  wholesale market by building new plants and selling power to the state's  incumbent utilities. The Commission has also suggested eliminating the power of  state government to approve power plant development and limiting the ability of  local governments to block projects. The Commission is expected to issue a final  report on December 1, 2001.
Florida PSC Approves Independent  Power Line Operations
The Florida Public Service Commission  (PSC) has approved the transfer of the state's power lines from utility  jurisdiction to an independent company. The PSC has asked Florida's three main  utilities, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Florida and Power Corporation, and  Tampa Electric, to devise a proposal within 90 days that will turn over  operation of the power lines to an independent system operator. Commissioner  Michael A. Palecki said that the decision was made in the best interest for  ratepayers, utility companies and independent power companies seeking a  competitive market. Under an earlier proposal submitted to the PSC, the  utilities proposed a statewide regional transmission organization, GridFlorida,  that would have owned and managed the power lines. The PSC did not approve the  plan, as it would have moved jurisdiction of retail rates to the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission.
New England Congressmen Seek Equal  Representation on RTO Board
Twenty-three U.S. congressmen from  New England requested that their states be given adequate representation on the  governance of the Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO.) In an  effort organized by Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass), the bipartisan  delegation of congressmen wrote a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC) asking the regulators to create a governing board comprised of  equal numbers of representatives from New England, New York, and the  Mid-Atlantic. ""We view an equally balanced governance structure as the only way  in which a single market design can be implemented which would truly benefit the  consumers of all the regions,"" Markey said. FERC has been considering several  options for structuring the board that will oversee the unified Northeast  wholesale power market. One proposal gives five seats for representatives from  the Mid-Atlantic, three seats to New York, and two to New England. ISO New  England and New York Independent System Operator joined the congressman in  opposing that plan and requesting equal representation.
California Wants Consumers to See  Real Power Costs
In a move that may prevent a repeat meltdown of  the wholesale electricity market in California, the California Consumer Power  and Financing Authority wants to install electricity meters that charge  consumers the real cost of power. Currently consumers pay the same price for  electricity throughout the day even though the wholesale price varies every  hour. Therefore, consumers have no incentive to conserve during peak times. The  meters will charge residential consumers more for power used during peak hours,  when demand is highest and less during off peak times. The authority issued  requests for proposals, due by November 15, for a minimum of 10,000 real-time  meters, the cost of which varies between $200 and $1,000. The power authority  plans to finance the purchase of the meters and will market them to customers of  Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas &  Electric and dozens of municipal utilities. As consumers have shown to be  responsive to price signals in a pilot program in Washington, Californians too  can expect to reduce their energy consumption. Project manger, Kevin Wood of  Southern California Edison hopes his company will install meters for 11,000  customers by next summer. He said that if these customers, who represent 20 to  30 percent of the load, respond to price signals during peak hours, this may in  turn drive down wholesale prices for all users. While consumers may benefit, the  decrease in consumption may cost power generators millions of dollars in  revenue.
Environmentalists and Union Coalition  Oppose Deregulation in Indiana
A coalition of union members from  several groups showed their opposition to electric utility deregulation in  Indiana during a peaceful demonstration on November 7. The coalition, know as  People's Energy Campaign, includes members from UNITE Local 399, formerly the  Ladies Garment Workers Union, the Central Labor Council, Valley Watch  environmental group, and the Citizens Action Coalition. Denny Owen, an executive  board member of UNITE Local 399, expressed the general concern of the coalition  that deregulation should be discouraged. ""We don't think it'll make prices  lower, it'll make them go higher,"" Owen said. Indiana is considered to have low  utility rates compared to other states. Indiana lawmakers are considering  deregulation as newly introduced legislation proposes to create an Energy Policy  Commission that would craft a comprehensive energy plan for the state. Senator  Gard and other General Assembly members created the bill to address the state's  need for a true energy policy and as a means to address future electric load  growth. ""Merchant power plants have been a divisive issue in the past year and a  half,"" Gard said. ""There are many people who feel if the state has a  comprehensive energy policy, it might be better able to deal with this issue.  And we also have to pay attention to what's happened in California."" The bill  would set up a temporary commission with appointed members representing various  stakeholder groups including state government, industry, labor, and  environmental groups. The commission is scheduled to present a final report to  the governor in December 2002. While electric deregulation would not be a prime  focus of the commission, the ""specter of deregulation"" would have to be examined  in some fashion, Senator Gard said. SB 233 has been sent to the Senate Rules and  Legislative Procedures Committee. Senator Gard predicts it will pass the Senate,  although chances in the House of Representatives are less favorable.
Debate Over Oklahoma Transmission  System's Readiness to Serve Future Load
The Electric  Restructuring Advisory Committee met with industry officials on November 7 to  discuss the future capabilities of Oklahoma's transmission system. The committee  is responsible for researching the capabilities of the system, determining  whether upgrades are necessary, and delegating the responsibility for paying for  such upgrades. With new power plants being developed and proposals to open the  state to a competitive electric market in progress, concern has risen as to  whether the transmission system can handle the increased load. Stanton Hadley of  Oak Ridge National Laboratory reported that electricity demand in Oklahoma is  expected to grow 26 percent, to 14,350 megawatts by 2010. The transmission  system currently is able to handle only 13,300 megawatts. Nevertheless, power  companies are planning 13,500 megawatts of new power generation. Calpine  Corporation is spending about $20 million on transmission improvements between  its power plant near Coweta, Oklahoma, and the outlying region. Also, Public  Service Company of Oklahoma plans to spend $40 million on transmission upgrades  over the next few years. With the new power plants and a supply surplus  expected, Hadley also said that consumers could expect lower costs. John Wright,  one of the committee members questioning this assumption, said that in a  deregulated market, the utilities are likely to sell their power out of state.  If this were to occur, lower power prices would be unlikely. The Electric  Restructuring Advisory Committee will deliver a report to the Legislature at the  end of the year.
Thirty New Power Plants Proposed for  Virginia
The latest news out of the deregulation of Virginia's  electric power industry centers around thirty proposals for new power plants in  the state. While the surge in supply is expected to prevent a California-like  energy crisis, health and environmentalists argue that the air pollution and  smog from the plants could damage the state's parks and forests. Since 1998,  when the state announced its plans to open its energy markets to competition, 30  companies and utilities have asked for state approval to build new plants.  Activists complain that the new power would not even benefit Virginia's  customers, as the energy is intended for delivery in northeastern states. By  building plants in Virginia, utilities avoid the Northeast's stringent  environmental regulations. An advisory group composed of utility and industry  representatives argues that new plants pose no significant risk. They stated  that 28 of the new plants would run on cleaner-burning natural gas and that  other federal regulations would require older plants to reduce harmful emissions  by 65 percent by 2004. The representatives also expect that only a few of the  plants will actually be built due to market conditions and cooling-water  shortages.

Subject:	Credit worthiness - Alberta



Please find below the creditworthiness criteria for Alberta Pool.  I appreciate the help of Fino and Guillermo.
  

The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows: 
Rating		trading limit
AAA		$25,000,000
AA		$20,000,000
A		$15,000,000
BBB		$10,000,000
<BBB		$0

Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.  

If a participant's financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.

It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rating within 2 business days.

The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of default for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial position within 2 business days of said default or change.

Subject:	NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security

	Molly:

	Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's ""Supplier Select"" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted ""as financial evaluations dictate"". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as ""BBB"" from S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii) the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2.  

	In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an ""A"" bond rating; (iii) a security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least ""BBB"" by S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

	Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional information.

	MLC

"Power Prepayments","
It currently looks like we will not have any wire requests today for power prepayments. 

East Power - We are currently working with PJM and NEPOOL to come to a payment resolution to remain active and current in those two markets, and will not have any need for a wire transfers today (the earliest we will need may be tomorrow depending upon form of resolution).  Additionally, given the post Christmas market conditions and lack of liquidity (and staffing needs in companies other than Enron), Kevin and Dana were not able to execute any bilateral prepay deals for the regions outside PJM and NEPOOL.  They will be continuing to push these deals for the next several days, but realistically, it may be next week before we can actually pull these off.

West Power -  We will have tomorrow a detailed prepay list and wire requests for the first week of January.

Thanks for everyone's help with this process.
