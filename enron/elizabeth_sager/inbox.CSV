also, the 61 days goes from invoice date.
2. the collateral defn which includes general intangibles and proceeds will stay same.
3. re acquisitions-no change to the way they can approve now re acquisition process, so 70% comes out. (robert-i did talk to bill and michael about and they are ok with as is b and b).
4. amend 7(c) of master agreement to say that they have to provide covenant compliance cert. which says whether or not they have a MAC--right now ways that they have to say they have no MAC. this amendment should survive the replacement collateral period and be for all time. that way they have to tell us only one way or the other and the MAC does not cause an independent default in 2(a) of the master. this is how we think should have worked to begin with consistent with our other masters.
5. keep negative pledge.
6. severance cap: say that no executive deferred compensation or ""parachutes"" or similar will be paid during the period with our released cash or any other cash unless we are fully margined with cash and they have released the a/r and inventory. they can pay ""pay as you go severance"" during the period (i.e. no lump sum/ and limited to what the person would have received in monthly salary ordinarily).  they can also pay any other severance stuff (i.e. $ under employment contract )capped at $500,000.
david and elizabeth will turn the docs from last night with some other nits etc. fixed up for last internal look before we send. robert see if we haven't gotten what you have if you would so can keep going.
shout back anyone if disagree with above. have just confirmed this list with michael.

"Dynegy v. ComEd update","Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Pete,

Attached please find my comments and suggested revisions for the Master
Netting Agreement with Enron.  I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same
comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the
provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with
someone from Enron or someone in our shop.

For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes
focused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we
should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for
example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron
Energy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we
may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and
Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an
exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect
at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks.

Ernie

This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to ""kill"" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.

Christian, 

This reminds me of the custom where two warring tribes would make peace by each sending a group of children to live with the other tribe.  Concern for the safety of the children encouraged each side to keep the peace.

Subject:	FW: Short Payment Notice
Importance:	High

Hi David:

This note appears more alarming than it is because the impact is only $6,500.00 for the entire Ercot wide system according to our ERCOT client representative in a phone conversation.  In light of this Kevin Presto wanted to get ideas from the legal world of what the impact might be if the shortfall was 65,000,000.  

In my reading of 9.4.4 of the protocols ERCOT would have had to go after the credit line of the non-paying QSE before taking the step of reducing payment of other QSE's.

I have to assume that these steps were taken and if so, then I would have to assume that the initial shortfall was greater than $6,500.00 to begin with.  If the credit lines of the offending QSE were not reached for by ERCOT then my question is, why not.  These steps are clearly outlined in the Protocol.

I have contacted Thane Twiggs who is in Austin now to find more facts and will let you know when I hear from him.

Importance:	High


QSEs that are owed monies from ERCOT on invoices that are due today, October 15, 2001, will notice that the amount of funds transferred is short of the balance due on the invoice. This is a notification that ERCOT will follow the ""short payment"" procedure stated in the ERCOT protocols for payments being made to QSEs today.  Due to short payments by one or more QSEs, ERCOT is insufficient of funds to pay all amounts in full.  As described in the ERCOT protocols, section 9.4.4, ERCOT will deduct ERCOT administrative fees and reduce payments to all invoice recipients that are owed monies. The reductions will be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each ERCOT creditor for this invoice to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT's accounts on the payment date to insure revenue neutrality for ERCOT. ERCOT will distribute past due funds on a pro rata basis of monies owed on the next business day after receipt of the monies. 
If you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service representative.

FERC Rejects Reasons for Suppliers Higher  Prices
In an order issued on October 5, the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected the cost justifications of several power  suppliers that sold wholesale electricity above the proxy market-clearing price  during July 2001. The electricity had been sold into the California Independent  System Operator (CA-ISO) and Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC). FERC  said that the justifications from Dynegy, Reliant Energy, Mirant, and Williams  Energy were ""either untimely filed and/or unsupported"" and has ordered refunds  on those transactions. The four suppliers submitted their cost justifications in  compliance with FERC's April 26 order that established price mitigation for  sales into the CA-ISO's spot markets starting in late May. That order required  power suppliers and generators who submitted bids above the market-clearing  price to file a justification for the higher prices within seven days of the end  of the month in which the sale occurred. FERC did not disclose how much money  would be refunded since the four companies requested that the matter be treated  confidentially. In a separate case, FERC Administrative Law Judge Bruce Birchman  has until March 8 to issue a report on whether California is entitled to refunds  of nearly $9 billion for wholesale power purchases when prices skyrocketed in  the past year. The report's recommendations will be considered by FERC  commissioners for further action.
 
Nuclear plant had long list of  failings
Inexperience, sloppy work habits and poor maintenance  increased the chances of dangerous accidents at the Bruce nuclear power station  in Ontario, the world's largest atomic facility, says a secret report obtained  by The Globe and Mail. The report was compiled in 1998 by a group of highly  trained, independent nuclear experts from the World Association of Nuclear  Operators (WANO), an industry advisory group based in Atlanta. It was given to  Ontario Power Generation, the provincially owned utility, the following year.  Among its findings: Some operators were unaware of such important topics as the  time it would take for water in reactors to begin boiling away if flows of  cooling water were blocked. Nuclear-plant operators disconnected warning alarms  they found too noisy. Operators sometimes did not watch instrument control  panels, but had their backs turned to them, which could slow any response to a  problem. ""Should an inadvertent loss of primary heat transport coolant occur,  operator response could be delayed, resulting in a loss of core cooling."" More  than 2,500 nuclear-plant modifications were not incorporated into design  manuals, leading to confusion about how the plant actually runs. There was a  backlog in preventive and corrective maintenance and some maintenance work was  poorly done. WANO tried to block The Globe's access to the report, which listed  dozens of other sloppy practices at the Bruce facility, and a second related  report that found troubling safety lapses at the Pickering nuclear station. But  the organization recently abandoned a court challenge seeking to have the  documents remain confidential. It is the first time WANO reports assessing the  performance of nuclear plants have been publicly released anywhere in the world.  A Bruce station official said its performance has improved dramatically since  the critical report was written. WANO now considers Bruce ""one of the fastest  improving nuclear plants in North America,"" said Duncan Hawthorne, chief  executive officer at the site. One nuclear energy critic said concerns raised in  the report about possible loss of cooling -- an interruption in the flow of  water that keeps a reactor from overheating -- describes an event that could  cause a serious mishap by allowing unwanted nuclear chain reactions. ""It could  result in some form of criticality accident, which could eventually lead to a  meltdown,"" said David Martin, a nuclear safety consultant with the Sierra Club  of Canada. The Globe and Mail requested the reports under Ontario's freedom of  information act in 1999. Both Ontario Power and WANO opposed the releases.  Ontario Power argued that public knowledge of the reports would jeopardize its  finances and increase the cost of its liability insurance. The government  utility completed a long-term agreement leasing the Bruce facility, located on  the shores of Lake Huron, to a unit of British Energy earlier this year. WANO,  in seeking to keep the records secret, asserted nuclear safety is enhanced if  the public is kept in the dark about its findings because nuclear staff are more  likely to be honest about mistakes if their remarks are kept confidential. But  Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner ruled last year there was a  ""compelling interest"" for the public to have the nuclear-safety information.  Shortly after the newspaper made its request for the records, the Ontario  government changed its information law to exempt provincially owned electricity  companies from the act, blocking future public access to these safety reports.  The WANO reports, known as peer reviews, were viewed at the highest level of the  utility, with copies sent to Ronald Osborne, Ontario Power's president. During  WANO reviews, a team of nuclear experts scours the plant, looking for sloppy  work practices, poor maintenance and inadequate training, while also trying to  discover the causes of these failings. At the Bruce plant, WANO officials  reviewed four of the eight reactors. The officials found the failure to keep  accurate designs at the station, known as Bruce B, helped create confusion over  three unplanned reactor shutdowns in 1997 that were caused by the triggering of  automatic safety systems. Operators had a hard time figuring out why the  shutdowns happened because the designs showed wiring layouts from the wrong  nuclear stations. The report also noted that 10 forced reactor shutdowns were  caused by equipment problems. These have arisen because the station had a ""large  and increasing backlog"" in preventive and corrective maintenance tasks.   Staff also conducted incompetent maintenance work. In one case, a pump needing  an overhaul was taken from service, but it was later discovered that the spare  parts for this work were unavailable. ""The pump was subsequently returned to  service without undergoing the associated maintenance,"" the report said. I1998, there were about 4,000 corrective maintenance tasks at the station. Mr.  Hawthorne said that total is now less than 200, reflecting the plant's improving  performance. However, there was a backlog of about 1,000 preventive maintenance  tasks in 1998, a figure that has since grown to 1,200. Mr. Hawthorne said the  total of preventive jobs is considered normal within the industry.
 
Barton Adds Supports for FERC Authority and  RTOs
Senate Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe  Barton (R-TX) has revised his draft electricity bill to support the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) proposed requirement that forces utilities  to participate in regional transmission organizations (RTOs). The proposal  requires that all transmitting utilities form or participate in an RTO within  18 months. Barton's draft bill also gives additional authority to FERC by  allowing the commission to propose changes to applications if minimum standards  are not met. Utilities would have the right to appeal FERC's decision to the  federal courts. While FERC is pushing for the creation of four RTOs, Barton's  draft bill does not recommend a specific number of RTOs. The revised legislation  requires a 40,000 MW generation minimum from any new RTO. This requirement was  added to minimize the amount of inter-RTO transmission problems. The bill  includes an incentive rate provision which opponents claim would undermine  FERC's authority to determine just and reasonable rates. Proponents argue that  incentive rates are necessary to account for the inherent risks that  transmission companies face.
 
FERC's Public Access Rulemaking is  Questioned
A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposed rulemaking on public  access of informational filings is generating mixed reactions. FERC is proposing  that utilities and power marketers electronically file an ""index of customers""  on a quarterly basis with a summary of the contractual terms and conditions for  market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission services. The  proposed rule would require that the information be posted on a publicly  available Internet website. State regulators see FERC's July rulemaking proposal  as an opportunity to improve regulatory oversight of competitive markets. The  National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) applauds the  proposal, stating, ""One of the most important and formidable tools in market  monitoring is access to data that is readily available and useful to the  public."" However, utilities are warning FERC that making such ""proprietary and  commercially sensitive information"" available to the public ""could be harmful to  the development of robust electricity markets."" The Edison Electric Institute's  Alliance of Energy Suppliers is requesting that FERC defer action on the  rulemaking.
Debate Over Use of PJM as Model for Northeast  RTO
Wholesale suppliers and the PJM Interconnection have recommended that PJM's  market design and governance structure be used as a model for a Northeast  regional transmission organization (RTO). They believe that using the PJM model  would facilitate the quickest transition from the current system of independent  system operators (ISOs) to one large RTO. Duke Energy North America reported to  Platts Electric Power Daily that ""The PJM market-building philosophy of  cautious, incremental, modular building blocks which emphasizes market-driven  solutions rather than command-and-control decision and frequent market  interventions has worked far better than approaches taken in either New York or  New England."" Administrative Law Judge Peter Young recommended on September 17,  2001 to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that PJM be used as a  starting point. Young proposed an RTO plan that would have an operational RTO  within 36 months of the FERC order. His recommendations resulted from the July  2001 mediation talks that discussed the creation of a Northeast RTO. FERC has  since asked for comments regarding Young's plan. Enron and PJM contend that an  RTO could be operational within one year if FERC acts expeditiously. New York  ISO and New England ISO argue that FERC should consider another approach because  using PJM as a model would ignore geographic and philosophic differences. The  PJM utilities do not have divested generating assets, as do the two regions not  covered by PJM. The ISOs also pointed out that PJM does not contain so-called  load centers like New York City or Boston.
Support for Delay in Arkansas' Deregulation
Entergy, Arkansas' largest electric utility, has agreed with State Attorney  General Mark Pryor to support a delay in the state's restructuring efforts. An  amended restructuring statute in effect as of April 2001 pushed back the start  date of deregulation to October, 2003. The Public Service Commission (PSC) was  given the authority to delay deregulation further until 2005 if necessary to  ensure that deregulation will benefit consumers. Several concerns still exist,  according to local sources. A study by La Capra Associates showed that Arkansas  consumers might experience higher, more volatile electric rates if the retail  market is deregulated before October 2005. The study also reports that wholesale  electric markets and operating electronic systems haven't developed, both are  necessary for successful retail market competition. Entergy's President, Hugh  McDonald, has also expressed concern that the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission's (FERC) push to create four regional transmission organizations  (RTOs) may slow the move to retail competition. Additionally, State Attorney  General Pryor has noted that two utilities serving the Arkansas market are  experiencing difficulty meeting the January 2002 deregulation deadline in Texas.  The governor, PSC, and the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation consider  repeal of deregulation to be the best choice for consumers. Entergy believes  repeal is unnecessary and that delaying until 2005 will cause no harm to  consumers. A PSC hearing on the topic is set for October 18, 2001.
Entergy seeks deregulation delay in Texas
Texas  is experiencing a less than seamless transition to a competitive retail electric  market. Entergy Corp. has asked the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) to  delay deregulation in the Southeast Texas service area for 8 ? months,  transmission congestion is costing some Texas utilities millions of dollars, and  reports show that Texas consumers have been subject to ""slamming"" (switching  utility providers without their consent.) Entergy's request is a turnaround from  the corporation's announcement in September that deregulation should move  forward and that it was ready to move into a competitive marketplace. The  corporation has now filed a memorandum along with the PUC staff, an industrial  electricity users group, and the Office of the Public Utility Council, asking  the PUC to delay deregulation for 8 ? months. Entergy's spokesperson says that  the request stems from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's and Entergy's  inability to come to consensus on an independent regional transmission operator.  
Problems For Texas on the Path To  Deregulation
Municipally-owned Austin Energy is among a group of  Texas utilities that have experienced rising costs in a deregulated energy  market. Their agreement to share transmission costs across the state for  generated electricity is costing more than anticipated. The PUC and the Electric  Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimated last year that a state program  designed to ensure that enough electricity can move around the state during peak  periods would cost utilities $20 million in the year starting July 31, 2001.  Since each utility's share of the cost is based on its use of the grid, Austin  Energy expected its 4 percent share to be $800,000 for the first year. However,  Austin Energy has already been billed approximately $2 million for the  period between July 31 and September 21.
North Carolina  Regulators Oppose Southeastern RTO  
The North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) has expressed opposition to  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) move to create four regional  transmission organizations (RTOs). In September, an administrative law judge  reported on closed-door mediation discussions aimed at developing an RTO in the  Southeast. NCUC considers the 45-day long talks illegal. FERC supports the  creation of a Southeast RTO, reflecting RTO proposals submitted by GridSouth,  GridFlorida, and Entergy. NCUC objects that ""...FERC is now attempting to strip  retail customers of all rights to existing transmission capacity and make it  available...to relatively new entities, such as Independent Power Producers and  marketers. This attempt must fail."" NCUC says that it will take its case to  court to prevent FERC from moving forward on this issue.
""Slamming"" reported in Texas pilot  program
Problems arising from Texas' move towards a competitive  retail electric market have also spread to the consumers. Under the state's  pilot project, 5 percent of the market was opened to competition, allowing  companies to compete for consumers by offering lower prices and different  service plans. The Texas deregulation law strictly prohibits ""slamming,""  electric providers switching consumer's service without obtaining permission.  New Power Company received at least 14 complaints about slamming; Green  Mountain, Reliant, First Choice and Shell each received one ""slamming""  complaint. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that 68 complaints have been  filed between March 1, 2001 and September 27, 2001 concerning billing  procedures, delays in the pilot project, customer service and deceptive trade  practices. On one positive note for consumers, the PUC has published a consumer  education brochure, ""The Electricity Facts Label: What it is and How it Will  Help You Shop for Electricity."" The brochure will help consumers understand the  new electricity labels that Retail Electric Providers (REPs) are required to  provide when retail competition begins. The label gives information on  electricity prices, contract terms, generation sources, and emissions in a  standardized format. The labels are intended to help customers make informed  decisions about choosing their electric service.
Texas' Power  Supply to Increase
Two new developments in Texas are expected to  increase power supply in the state. American Electric Power Co. (AEP) is  currently seeking approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) to  provide energy supply services to large commercial and industrial customers if  deregulation begins in January 2002. AEP has a total of about 1 million  customers in Texas with its three subsidiaries: Central Power and Light Co.,  West Texas Utilities and Southwestern Electric Power Co. The company expects the  PUC to act within two to three months. In addition, Steag Power, the  Houston-based unit of Germany-based electricity utility Steag AG, plans to  develop a 900 MW to 1,200 MW gas-fired power station in Ennis, Texas. The  company submitted its application to the Electric Reliabilty Council of Texas  and the Southwest Power Pool. Construction is planned to begin next year and  reach commercial operation by 2004. The plant will increase Texas' generating  capacity and may help to relieve the state's congestion problem of transmitting  power from south to north. New power plants, as well as new transmission lines,  are needed in the north to ease congestion.
Bingaman to Resume  Work on Comprehensive Energy Bill
Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-New Mexico) will resume  consideration of a comprehensive energy bill the week of October 14. The bill  includes provisions related to electricity restructuring, including expansion of  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) authority over municipal and  cooperative utilities. The proposed legislation would also allow regional  transmission organizations to rely on FERC to rule when transmission projects  are delayed or rejected by state officials.
Federal Trade Commission Issues Report on Electric Power  Regulatory Reform
A new report has been issued by the Federal  Trade Commission (FTC) that examines state retail electricity programs and their  ability to provide consumer benefits. Competition and Consumer Protection  Perspectives on Electric Power Regulatory Reform: Focus on Retail Competition  compares state and federal authority on competitive issues and implementation of  successful retail competition programs. The FTC report finds that most electric  markets are in a transitional phase. The benefits of a competitive market will  not be realized until the advent of full competition, without price regulation,  has been achieved. The report also explains that competitive wholesale markets  must accompany competition in retail markets. The report notes, ""... as  wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and  jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and  retail competition to be successful."" The FTC report also cites that  artificially low ""standard-offer rates,"" which are provided to customers who do  not choose a new supplier, may act as a barrier for new retail suppliers. These  low rates reduce the incentive for customers to seek alternative suppliers. The  report urges retail suppliers to offer competitive metering and billing services  in addition to variable pricing for generation services. Standardized labeling  of power products and services, enforcement of truth-in-advertising laws, and  consumer education efforts will help consumers make informed decisions.
Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Open-Access  Rules
The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday on Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction to regulate wholesale  transmission services and power sales. The Court's ruling will have an important  impact on the U.S. power market. It could either open the transmission grid to  retail competition or limit competition to the retail level. As Dow Jones  reports, ""The case has great ramifications for congressional debate on electric  industry restructuring legislation and FERC's ongoing efforts to promote  competition as a surrogate for regulation."" Nine states, led by New York, argued  that FERC overstepped its authority with Order 888, that required utilities to  open their transmission lines to competing power merchants. Lawrence Malone,  general counsel for the group, argued that the order preempted state authority  to regulate retail sales and set rates. In 1999, FERC carried the order further  by mandating that utilities turn over control of their power lines to  independent regional transmission organizations, or RTOs. The states are  appealing the District of Columbia Court of Appeals decision in June 2000 that  upheld FERC's orders. Currently, FERC is working to establish four RTOs to  control the nation's transmission system. Meanwhile, Enron, the largest U.S.  wholesale power player, argued that FERC violated federal law because it did not  require access to transmission lines when utilities kept transmission and retail  sales as one operation. This bundled service remains in many states where  competition is not yet allowed. Caught in the middle, FERC argued that its  orders were issued to achieve a balance between giving competitors equal access  to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states.
FERC Chairman Unveils Plans
Pat Wood, the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission's new Chairman, has proposed a set of issues on  which he wants the Commission to focus. At the Commission's September 26th  meeting, Wood proposed the following for FERC's upcoming agenda: ensuring  adequate generation capacity; transmission constraints; regional transmission  organizations (RTOs); energy infrastructure; standards of conduct for  transmission providers; market monitoring and enforcement; and market based  rates. One important proposal unveiled at this meeting would mandate that  transmission owning utilities be given until December 15, 2001, to join an  approved RTO or lose their right to charge market based rates. Additionally,  Wood recommended that mergers would only be approved for power entities  belonging to operational RTOs. ""Once the entire country is covered by RTOs,"" he  said, ""states will have the option to deregulate on the retail level or not.""  Wood also proposed a rulemaking on market design and structure in order to make  a seamless national power marketplace. A new transmission tariff would replace  the pro forma open access transmission tariff established by Order 888. Staff at  FERC discussed changing the Commission's methodology for assessing market power  for the purpose of approving market-based rate applications. While none of the  proposals were voted on, the meeting was important for opening up discussion and  addressing the Commission's key challenges and objectives for the coming year. A  series of commissioner-led workshops will be held at FERC's headquarters from  October 15-19, 2001. Congestion management, cost recovery, market monitoring,  transmission planning, business and reliability standards, and the nature of  transmission rights have been proposed for discussion at the workshops.
Maryland and DC Blast FERC on RTO plan
Both the  Maryland and Washington DC public service commissions have expressed concern  over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) initiative to integrate  the U.S. Northeast transmission network. In a new plan proposed by FERC Chairman  Pat Wood, utilities would have to submit plans by December 15, 2001, to join a  regional transmission organization (RTO) or lose the right to sell electricity  in the wholesale market. Catherine Reilly, Chairman of the Maryland Public  Utility Commission, is concerned about the plan's effect on the Northeast's  economy and the potential for creating another California-type crisis. The  Maryland Commission held hearings on RTOs in Baltimore on Wednesday and Thursday  of this week.
Southwest and Midwest Utilities Form Transmission  Groups
FERC's push for utilities to merge their networks into  regional transmission organizations (RTOs) came one step closer to being  realized this week. Six Southwestern utilities have signed an initial  ""Memorandum of Understanding"" regarding the formation and operation of an RTO  and plan to file with FERC by mid-October. The new RTO, WestConnect, will be  created by Arizona Public Service Co., Salt River Project, El Paso Electric Co.,  Public Service Company of New Mexico, Tucson Electric Power Co., and Texas-New  Mexico Power Co. In addition, six Midwestern utilities filed with FERC last  Friday to create an independent, for-profit transmission company, TRANSLink. The  utilities include Alliant Energy, Corn Belt Power Cooperative, MidAmerican  Energy, Nebraska Public Power District, Xcel Energy, and Omaha Public Power  District. ""A for-profit entity, focused solely on the growth and enhancement of  a robust transmission system over a large region, will be much more effective  than either the current situation or transferring operational control to an  independent system operator,"" said Wayne Brunetti, chairman, president, and CEO  of Xcel Energy. The six companies have asked FERC to expedite their application  so that TRANSLink can be formed by early next year.
North Carolina's Restructuring Plans Still on  Hold
The North Carolina Study Commission on the Future of  Electric Service has decided to place its restructuring deliberations on hold  until early next year. Study Commission meetings were interrupted early in 2001  due to the length of the state legislative session, which occupied several Study  Commission members. Members of the Commission have expressed concern about  implementing electricity restructuring. Sen. Kay Hagan, D-Guilford, explained  that, ""I can't see us doing anything...There are so many people worried  about...California."" Hagan and Rep. Mary Jarrell, D-Guilford, also on the  Commission, have urged North Carolina to take the steps necessary to avoid the  same problems experienced in California. Neither legislator foresees the Study  Commission resuming its deliberations until January 2002.
Pennsylvania Retail Electricity Shopping  Declines
According to figures released last Tuesday by the  Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate, electricity retail shopping fell  during the third quarter of 2001. The number of consumers buying from  alternative suppliers dropped 8% from July 1st. This decline is less than the  32% drop that occurred between April and July; total electric load has declined  by 10% since July. 337,918 or 6.4% of the customers in the state are buying  1,458 MW from other suppliers, or approximately 6% of the state's total load.  Again, this is less than the 67% decline in electric load purchased from other  suppliers that occurred between April and July. According to the Electric Power  Daily Online, ""Load fell more dramatically than customer participation in the  spring because many of the expiring long-term contracts were held by large  industrial and commercial customers."" Pennsylvania opened its electricity market  to competition in 1999. In April of 2000, 10% of the state residents chose  alternative energy suppliers, subsequently, high gas prices and tight electric  capacity drove up wholesale prices in the summer of 2000. Many alternative  suppliers pulled out of the market, as they were unable to offer competitive  prices. Participation in the retail electricity market has been declining since  then.
Texas' Electricity-Grid Operator Needs More Power  Lines
An annual report released on Monday by the Electric  Reliability Council of Texas states that Texas needs more electricity  transmission lines, raising concern as the state plans to open its electricity  market to competition in January 2002. Without adequate transmission lines,  congestion problems will likely arise and the flow of power may be interrupted.  The report has identified six zones where more lines are needed to deliver power  from south to north Texas and to bring electricity into the Dallas area. Eight  major projects are being developed to address the problems and others are being  considered.

"RE: FW: ENE/ENA Change of Ownership Diligence Inquiry","The 11/1 e-mail (excerpt below) also notes that no event of default otherwise would occur, a fact specific inquiry; e.g., debt to cap ratio upon consummation of the merger:

Typical merger provisions provide that either (i) ENE survive or if not, (ii) 
the survivor be organized under U.S. (or state thereof) law, 
assume all obligations of ENE under the subject contract, and 
no event of default under the subject agreement would exist or result (whether an event of default would exist requires facts on a specific deal so covenants and other contract terms can be tested). 

To the extent that other groups reported to me differences from the typical provisions set forth above, I forwarded them onto to you.

Subject:	Re: FW: ENE/ENA Change of Ownership Diligence Inquiry

In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

I have been unable to confirm a meeting for the week of November 12 at AEP
in Columbus.  I would like to propose an alternative, which is to meet in
Washington, D.C. on the 12th.  ALthough EEI's offices will be closed that
day, Ed Comer said we could use the meeting space.  EEI would be unable to
arrange any catering however.  Alternatively, we might be able to rely on
the good graces of member company Washington counsel.  Please let me know
if the 12th in D.C. from 10-4 works for people.  Liz Sager says that the
collateral annex will be ready for review by then.  The concern is that if
we wait too long we are into the holidays and I think there needs to be a
meeting of the working group and a workshop on the collateral annex no
later than January.  Although my last day at EEI is the 22nd, I will be
keeping this email address for purposes of communications regarding the EEI
Contract.

Subject:	RE: CalPX Collateral Issue

This is a quick note to let the team know that I do have the credit worthiness requirements for PX (FERC Electric Service Tariff, Art. 2.4); a summary could be prepared if needed.   I trust that the Team would benefit from a legal opinion on Art. 2.4.5, and the associated schedule 2 of the tariff  related to ""Changes in the Amount of Security Provided by a PX Participant""  which allows a refund of securities above the PX security Amount.  As Steve mentioned nicely below, if the security amount is zero, then perhaps there is an argument for a full refund.

On the same theme, I am investigating  the requirements for maintaining ESP (electricity service provider) in California.  One of the conditions is that the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO.  If the CA ISO also necessitates participant status in the PX for  some transactions, then there is a circular flow in the argument, and may be there is a need to maintain a form of relationship with the PX.

I shall keep you posted with progress.

Subject:	CalPX Collateral Issue

Thanks Steve.  With your input, my take on Elizabeth's questions are:

1.	Must we renew the collateral?-  From a legal standpoint the answer is ""No"" for the reasons discussed below.  However, as we know, the PX will take a contrary position and has (along with other California parties) taken the position at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of the CA refund case at FERC (to secure payment of refunds due).

2.	May we replace the letters of credit with cash / other collateral?-  The answer is ""Yes"" as you note below, with the caveat that the replacement collateral must be acceptable to the PX.  Obviously cash should be acceptable.  Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option.

3.	What is the potential outcome if we do nothing (i.e. we don't re-up the letters of credit).  Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration.

As for additional options, we could consider:

1. 	Further to Steve's option 1, we might try to enforce the return of the excess in court by submitting a Section 2.5 request to the PX and bringing the issue to a head.  Steve's original option is preferable, however, since it is through agreement with the PX.  Perhaps a compromise could be proposed for the PX to return our collateral over and above our highest potential refund liability to the PX in the CA refund case.	

2.	Seeking injunctive relief in court to prevent the PX from drawing on the letter of credit.

Elizabeth, please advise if this answers your questions fully.

Thanks,  Ray

I agree. 

Schedule 2, section 2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall post collateral for 100 % of its requirements in excess of the unsecured line of credit in order to participate in the CTS and Core Markets""  [I would note that (1) our ""requirements"" are currently zero, and (2) we do not wish, nor is it possible to ""participate"" in the CTS and Core Markets.  Therefore, the PX has no basis under its Tariff to continue to hold our collateral.]

As you indicated below, Schedule 2, section 2.2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall maintain sufficient collateral to cover its aggregate outstanding liabilities in the Day-Ahead and Day-Of markets to and from the PX between cash clearing cycles or during the period in which the liabilities are incurred and when payment is billed and settled.""  

Options:

1.  If the PX will allow us to have access to our excess cash pursuant to Section 2.5 (requests submitted by COB Wednesday will be processed by Friday), then let them cash in the LC.

2.  Ask the PX if we can substitute ""other liquid collateral acceptable to the PX. .  .in lieu of cash"" (Schedule 2, section 2.1.3).  We should ask them what else would be acceptable (a lien on Jeff Skilling's house?).

Since these markets are no longer in operation, there is no lawful reason to withhold the collateral, notwithstanding the assertions of CA parties that it should be used to guarantee payment of refunds ordered in the CA refund proceeding at FERC.

Hi Liz,
 
It was fun catching up with you at  Dr.Injak's.  Like you, I married a geologist (my dad and brother-in-law are  also geologists).  It's a nice change from lawyers.  
I hope Sam is doing OK.  What did the doctor  say to do for him?
Let me know what your schedule is like and we can  meet some time.  I'm fairly flexible, but have a nanny only 2 days per  week, so the rest of the time Connor is with me.  My little  shadow.

"Proposed Approach to Book-out and Reestablish","Carol, 
Hope things have calmed down for you this week.  We are looking at Enron's proposed master netting agreement that Sara Shackleton sent to Beth Ng last week.  We should be able to send her comments on that shortly.  Also, we would like to get your comments on our form cover sheet to the EEI master, which McDermott, Will & Emery has sent to you on our behalf. 
Meanwhile, we would like to explore additional means to manage our credit risk to each other, particularly in light of the multiple affiliated parties in which we each trade.  As we discussed last week, one way to do so is to do a series of trades that would result in the close-out of existing positions, corresponding settlement payments, and the reestablishment of the positions through new trades at market.  A startegy such as the following would probably require implementation by means of numerous trades.  Although the proposed strategy will result in cash payments, one goal of the proposed strategy is for the two group of companies to remain cash neutral. 
Here is an example of how the strategy would work: 
Assume (These exposures are purely hypothetical and are not intended to represent the values of transactions between Morgan Stanley and Enron entities): 
1)A)   Based on Swaps and cash settled Options, MSCGI has exposure (before collateral) to ENAC in the amount of $40 MM, ENAC's threshold is $5 
MM and MSCGI is holding collateral in the amount of $35 MM, for an exposure net of Collateral of $5 MM. 
B)  Based on UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity trades, ECTRL in London has exposure to MSCGI in the amount of $10 MM. 
2)  ENAC and MSCGI agree to: (i) book out certain Swaps and Options resulting in ENAC paying $10 MM to MSCGI; (ii) reestablish those positions through new trades at market; and (iii) amend the ENAC/MSCGI CSA to provide that notwithstanding the mark-to-market Exposure of all outstanding Swaps and Options, MSCGI is entitled to hold $10 MM of the existing Collateral as a separate Independent Amount. 
3)  MSCGI and ECTRL book-out all of the existing UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity trades, resulting in MSCGI paying $10 MM to ECTRL. 
MSCGI and ECTRL reestablish the UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity positions through new trades at market. 
After all of these trades and amendments are completed, the status of the parties are 
as follows: 
A)  MSCGI has exposure (before collateral) to ENAC in the amount of $40 MM - $10 MM = $30 MM.  ENAC's threshold is still $5 MM.  MSCGI continues to hold collateral in the amount of $35 MM (the new Independent Amount of $10 MM + the collateral of $25 MM for the new required Exposure, i.e., $25 MM = $30 MM - $5 MM).  MSCGI's exposure to ENAC net of Collateral = of $5 MMNAC owes MSCGI $145.0 MM (before $140 MM of cash collateral) on Electricity Forwards, Options and settled trades (for an exposure net of collateral equal to $5.0 MM); and 
B)  MSCGI owes ECTRL $0 MM on UK Gas, UK Electricity, German Electricity and settled trades. 
The amendment to the CSA described in (2)(iii) above is required.  Otherwise, the new exposure before collateral would be $40 MM - $10 MM = $30 MM.  With collateral previously posted equal to $35 MM, ENAC might request that MSCGI return collateral equal to $10 MM.  Without the Independent Amount of $10 MM, ENAC's Required Collateral would equal $30 MM - $5 MM = $25 MM.  If MSCGI were required to return the $10 MM as a result of these trades, it would defeat the purpose of the proposed strategy being cash neutral. 
Thus, to stay cash neutral, this proposal only works to the extent that it is possible to amend the ENAC/MSCGI CSA to create this right of MSCGI to hold collateral as an Independent Amount at least equal to the amount that MSCGI must pay ECTRL under the booked-out UK Gas, UK Electricity and German Electricity trades.  Alternatively, it would work in any cases where the trading relationships between MS and Enron entities do not currently have either party posting collateral to the other, since we can take a similar approach to take advantage of potentially opposite exposures involving other MS and Enron commodities trading relationships. 
Please call me after you review this to discuss further. 
Regards, Bill

USA: UPDATE 1-FERC judge - El Paso didn't drive up natgas price.
By Chris Baltimore
  
10/09/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
WASHINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge ruled on Tuesday that El Paso Corp. did not improperly drive up natural gas prices on its pipelines into California last year. 
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner did find El Paso guilty of so-called affiliate abuse, in which the firm violated a FERC rule prohibiting communications between pipeline companies and their marketing affiliates. 
The full four-man FERC commission will consider Wagner's findings and determine penalties, if any, at a later date. 
California utilities accused El Paso, owner of several pipelines that ship natural gas into the state, of improperly sharing information with its affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co., which they said pushed up prices. 
""While El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, there was not a clear showing that they had in fact done so,"" Wagner told Reuters after issuing his 41-page report. 
The California Public Utility Commission, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison International's Southern California Edison, claimed El Paso withheld capacity on its four pipelines into the state from March through November of last year. The trio alleged that inflated prices and cost Californians an extra $3.7 billion. 
Natural gas is widely used to fuel electricity generating plants. Soaring prices for natural gas until this summer were blamed for exacerbating California's chronic power shortages. 
Houston-based El Paso has maintained it did not inflate natural gas prices on its pipelines into California. 
The company said it had no financial incentive to push prices higher because it had hedged roughly 90 percent of its natural gas to third parties before prices soared higher last year. 
JUDGE FINDS COLLUSION 
Wagner did not make a recommendation on financial penalties in the case despite finding El Paso violated FERC codes of conduct. 
""That would be the remedies phase that the full commission will consider at a later date,"" Wagner said. ""I didn't even consider (financial) remedies at this point."" 
""The record in this case is not at all clear that they in fact exercised market power,"" Wagner wrote. ""The issue in the complaint concerning whether El Paso Pipeline and/or El Paso Merchant may have had market power and, if so, exercised it to drive up natural gas prices at the California border should be dismissed."" 
The agency judge said transcripts of telephone conversations on Feb. 7 and Feb. 9 of last year between officials with El Paso Merchant and the company's Mojave Pipeline affiliate showed ""blatant collusion"" by the companies. 
Under FERC's standards of conduct, a pipeline must give information about natural gas transportation to all potential shippers as well as the company's own marketing affiliate. The rules also require a pipeline's operating staff and the staff of its marketing affiliate to function independently of each other. 
""These telephone transcripts demonstrate blatant collusion on the part of El Paso Merchant and Mojave/El Paso Pipeline to keep secret a discount for service on the downstream Mojave system until the open season ended, giving El Paso Merchant an advantage in making its bid for the total 1,220 million cubic feet per day,"" the judge wrote. 
EXECUTIVES DIDN'T TESTIFY 
Wagner also noted that neither El Paso Merchant or Mojave executive testified at the FERC administrative law hearing, despite El Paso attorneys' promise to have the witnesses appear. 
""The chief judge finds that El Paso Corp. and its affiliates El Paso Pipeline, Mojave and El Paso Merchant were in clear violation of standards of conduct,"" Wagner wrote. ""There was little separation of regulated and non-regulated businesses by El Paso Corp with a sharing of information and close supervision by the corporate head."" 
""While there are clear violations of the current standards of conduct in this case, those rules were promulgated many years ago and the gas industry has undergone tremendous changes since then with merger after merger creating large holding companies, such as the El Paso Corp., and very different methods of doing business than in bygone years,"" Wagner said.

However, as we know, the PX will take a contrary position and has (along with other California parties) taken the position at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of the CA refund case at FERC (to secure payment of refunds due).

2.	May we replace the letters of credit with cash / other collateral?-  The answer is ""Yes"" as you note below, with the caveat that the replacement collateral must be acceptable to the PX.  Obviously cash should be acceptable.  Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option.

3.	What is the potential outcome if we do nothing (i.e. we don't re-up the letters of credit).  Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration.

As for additional options, we could consider:

1. 	Further to Steve's option 1, we might try to enforce the return of the excess in court by submitting a Section 2.5 request to the PX and bringing the issue to a head.  Steve's original option is preferable, however, since it is through agreement with the PX.  Perhaps a compromise could be proposed for the PX to return our collateral over and above our highest potential refund liability to the PX in the CA refund case.	

2.	Seeking injunctive relief in court to prevent the PX from drawing on the letter of credit.

Elizabeth, please advise if this answers your questions fully.

Thanks,  Ray

I agree. 

Schedule 2, section 2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall post collateral for 100 % of its requirements in excess of the unsecured line of credit in order to participate in the CTS and Core Markets""  [I would note that (1) our ""requirements"" are currently zero, and (2) we do not wish, nor is it possible to ""participate"" in the CTS and Core Markets.  Therefore, the PX has no basis under its Tariff to continue to hold our collateral.]

As you indicated below, Schedule 2, section 2.2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall maintain sufficient collateral to cover its aggregate outstanding liabilities in the Day-Ahead and Day-Of markets to and from the PX between cash clearing cycles or during the period in which the liabilities are incurred and when payment is billed and settled.""  

Options:

1.  If the PX will allow us to have access to our excess cash pursuant to Section 2.5 (requests submitted by COB Wednesday will be processed by Friday), then let them cash in the LC.

2.  Ask the PX if we can substitute ""other liquid collateral acceptable to the PX. .  .in lieu of cash"" (Schedule 2, section 2.1.3).  We should ask them what else would be acceptable (a lien on Jeff Skilling's house?).

Steve, I believe that schedule 2, section 2.2 of the CalPX tariff is the provision that requires market participants to maintain collateral, the purpose of which, however, is to provide security for liabilities incurred in the PX markets.  Since these markets are no longer in operation, there is no lawful reason to withhold the collateral, notwithstanding the assertions of CA parties that it should be used to guarantee payment of refunds ordered in the CA refund proceeding at FERC.

"EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet","Elizabeth -

Here are the comments from me and Dede. I have given it to our Credit Dept.
and asked for comments but I doubt they will have much to add. Call me if
you have any questions with what we wrote.

With regard to the full-blown WSPP Collateral Annex, Dede and I think it
would be better to get the EEI one in a final form before converting it
over to fit into the WSPP. Otherwise, we could be revising the 2 documents
in parallel.

I am planning to get the short draft WSPP Collateral Annex over to you
today.

Thanks!

MOYERS IN CONVERSATION
Broadcast September 17, 2001
BILL MOYERS (BM): It's been almost a week now, and the questions continue to
pile up:
What kind of people would do this?
What do they want?
How do we witness death on this scale and go on with our lives?
What do we do about the rage we feel?
What does it mean to realize how vulnerable we suddenly are?

My guest tonight is uniquely qualified to help us answer these questions.
Robert Lifton has wrestled with some of the most disturbing events of the
time. Trained in psychology and psychiatry, 40 years ago he went to
Hiroshima to listen to the survivors of the world's first nuclear bombing
explosion. His book won the National Book Award.

"FW: Legal Discussion","
Elizabeth, 

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories. 

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.   

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements. 

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions. 

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.   

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result. 
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.   ----cgy

"RE: 2002 IT Budgets","Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

"Sierra Pacific Power/Nevada Power","Elizabeth,

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons:

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts.

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

Steve

By Monday Calger is going to try to have put together an estimate of burn rate on the top 25 contracts, potential supply sources for power/ gas, cash needs for contracts to maintain performance and a list of potential buyers/ assignees.  We are going to try to have another quick conference call on Monday to discuss what has been put together.

The pronounced slow down in trading and the release of the restatement of income figures, amounting as the numbers did,  to another heavy ""foot falling,""  are substantive factors that are not mitigated by the fact that the Street stayed its raised boot from punting us across the junk bond  line and that the Dynagy merger talks apparently continue, while the Mordant news further darkens the perception of the inner sanctum of the commercial temple.  

 What does it mean that as our inexorable fall continues step by step,  the crows, those sable messengers that were flying up and down this very river at this very site when Rome fell, are showing increasingly positive signs?  Today, several couples danced with what could only be seen as playfulness on the upcurrents of warm air that abound in and around the buildings,  gamboling aviary dyads  in the bright sun above the scarlet leaves, their dance upon the wind currents clearly celebratory, even to our reluctant, jaded eyes, sickened with foul corruption.    ----cgy

Group questions power payments
POWER CRISIS 
By Mike Taugher
CONTRA COSTA TIMES 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


An industry trade group asked market officials on Wednesday why they have failed to pay more than $1 billion for power sold during April and May.

""For some reason, the money is not getting from the ratepayers to the generators,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. ""Our hope is that this is a temporary misunderstanding.""

Part of the answer, officials said, is that the state's power-buying agency is refusing to pay its bills in full until it gets more information about who ultimately receives the cash.

Compounding the problem is the fact that when the May bills began coming due earlier this month, some market participants who were owed money from previous months credited their own accounts instead of paying in full, according to the Independent System Operator.

That left the ISO less able to pay its May bills, said ISO President and CEO Terry Winter in a written statement.

""The ISO acknowledges that past debt is due,"" Winter said in the statement.

Winter said the ISO would respond more fully to address questions about the underpayments by Friday. But in response to the IEP letter, he demanded that market participants quit crediting their own bills.

The ISO runs the spot markets in California. Buyers and sellers make their bids through the ISO, which sets the market price based on those bids, collects payments from the buyers and divvies them up to the sellers. 

The issue came to a head Wednesday when the IEP sent a letter to the ISO, demanding to know why generators were not paid in full for electricity sold in April and May. Smutny-Jones said estimates of unpaid amounts during that period ranged around $1.2 billion.

In early April, federal regulations went into effect that essentially barred the financially broke utilities from buying power in the ISO market. That forced the state Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity in January, to pick up the entire unmet need of the utilities' customers.

DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said that the state is required to compile certain information about bills it pays before it pays them. 

""We haven't been given what we feel is an adequate accounting of what we're going to be paid for,"" Hidalgo said. ""We are working with the ISO to see how we can get some of that information that we're not getting.""

ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said his agency is working with the water department, but that market tariffs require that some information be kept confidential.

""We can't tell one market participant what another market participant is doing,"" Fishman said.

AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.

Register for the seminar through our web site at:

"HYDA Index -2","
The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Monday, November 26, 2001 is:  -2.

The  daily press commentary provided one with an opportunity to be either pessimistic or optimistic as one's predisposition  dictated.  Does the fact that it was a day when no fresh and negative revelations were published mean it was a good day or a bad day?  Take your pick. 

Not a single crow was sighted on this cold day.  Nothing to base augury upon.  There must have been days like this in ancient Rome when the Senators gazed out across a bleak landscape and saw no birds.

"Draft of revised definition of Material Adverse Change/Credit Rating Trigger","Pursuant to our discussion yesterday regarding the above, please find below for your consideration a suggested revision to MAC/Credit Rating trigger definition to used in all future master trading agreements or confirmations in which Enron Corp's credit rating is part of a MAC/Credit Rating trigger.

""Material Adverse Change"" means (i) with respect to [Enron Trading Entity], Enron Corp. (or its successor or its successor's parent company) shall have long-term, senior, unsecured debt not supported by third party credit enhancement that is rated by S&P below ""BBB-"" [also insert Moody's as appropriate];

I understood yesterday that we may also need to consider changing the definition of Credit Support Provider in the ISDA's. I suspect that if ""Credit Support Provider"" is defined as Enron Corp. in the relevant Master, then the corresponding changes noted above would also need to be made. Your further thoughts regarding this issue are welcomed.

Please provide me your comments to the above language by tomorrow so we can start implementing a revised definition in our agreement templates.

Regards, Alan

"Judge's Final SE RTO Mediation Report + CN summary","The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast Power Grid platform that resulted from the mediation. 
 
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Model (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remaining unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  However, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its determination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should encourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by the parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FERC orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a model and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that parties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject her recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-type discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our suggested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholder participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  While she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not adopt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day 2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).
 
The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the Grid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (without any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed changes to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest 
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, regardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC 
Her opinion is that the ""Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility sponsored) Model"" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion management) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No. 2000 based on a ""best practices"" analysis of other RTOs and Commission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, etal.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model is not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsibilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below: 
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was added to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission owner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would administer the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and transmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She strongly encourages this split. 
Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets 
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), with RTO oversight 
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pursuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be subject to further discussion) 
RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including rate changes and tariff filings 
All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their rights should they win on appeal) 
4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and GridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant transmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existing facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those above).  There will be one ""through and out rate"", plus a Grid Management Charge for RTO operation. 
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT 
Financial Rights/LMP (includes ""real time spot market"") is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many details need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH).  Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation, auction and non-discriminatory release.  The Grid model includes a ""balancing resource"" requirement that we will provide comments against 
Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market establishment 
RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC 
RTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process 
Numerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functions (all of our comments from last week's response are included) 
Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many are still concerned that FERC had not conducted a ""cost-benefit"" analysis and had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the ""economies of scale"" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure.  In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shifting:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allowed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into retail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant ""jump start"" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Judge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the initial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a ""best practices"" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with LMP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent board structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process.  The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a minimum, consider similar mediated ""jump starts.""

The tax issue, as far as I see it does not do anything for us except put us in the position that we will have to make an application for a power marketing certificate using whatever vehicle provides the tax advisors with the solution they are seeking.
	
With Enron under the spotlight at the moment any filing at FERC would be picked up by the media and could be used to cause untold further damage to Enron's credibility and reputation. We could not for example provide any credible reason for setting up such an entity without revealing our true intent. In addition, the FERC Commissioners are going to be wary about expediting any application at the moment for an Enron entity which does not have an interest in a generating unit, for example.
	
As for Clinton Energy Services Management Inc, which has a power marketing certificate, we are getting an opinion from outside Counsel to confirm that if this entity was moved to become a subsidiary of Enron Corp. that because of the current ownership structure no filing will be necessary with FERC. We at least retain this option and can thereby proceed fairly quickly if required.
	
As to trading without a power marketing certificate I could not support this course of action. In addition, we would probably be in breach of any agreement we have with counterparties enabling them to terminate the agreements immediately.
	
If you need me I will be on 713 533 0313. and will be logged on.

"RE: Conference Call re: Transition of Into Product to MISO","Liz
	
Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to ""fill in the boxes"". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.
	
AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.
	
Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues. 
	
It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.
	
The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.
	
Signed you up for this call in your absence.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Recipients:
I also have been meeting with AEP's Into Product traders to discuss the
implications of moving to the MISO.  Conceptually what we have been
discussing is a ""policy statement"" of the ""Best Practices"" for allocating
the rights, obligations and commercial risk as between Sellers and Buyers
of existing Into Product transactions based on the current definition
contained in the EEI contract in as much the same manner under an RTO
structure as possible.  Separately from that transition product issue, but
somewhat related, is a need to define on a going-forward basis the products
sold within these emerging RTO structures on the first day of operation and
as a market rules emerge.  I will endeavor to email a draft proposal Monday
morning to this group.

I am NOT available to participate in a conference call from 2-3 PM Central
time (3-4 PM Eastern Time) on Monday.  I could do 4-5 PM Central  (5-6 PM
Eastern) on Monday.  If that is agreeable, I will set up the conference
call in number and pass code.  Please let me know.

Will it be possible for us to negotiate a single number across multiple commodities, or will we need to agree a separate number for each?

e.g. financial gas and financial power - are they one and the same?
How about ENA gas and EPMI power - do we need to agree specific numbers for each, or can we simply allocate internally an aggregate, agreed total?

"CAISO/Calpine","Wade here are the wiring instructions for two payments, one to the CAISO and one to Calpine:

CAISO:

$206,000

This amount represents two days' A/S and GMC charges, plus enough money to bring replenish the ""3-day buffer.""


Calpine:

$1,980,800

This represents two days' worth of energy to serve our California load.  Our price was $40/MWh.  


By purchasing this energy from Calpine instead of the CAISO, we saved $120/MWh ($60/MWh + $100/MWh underscheduling penalty).

This is a savings of approximately $6 million over the next two days.

"FORM CHANGES:  READ","
1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language.  

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

Hi, Andy.

Attached is the version of the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool Power and
Energy Market Rate Tariff that has been sent to MAPP's Power and Market
Committee for a vote for issuance and filing at FERC.  The vote is due
August 27, 2001.

As previously discussed, I would be grateful if you would secure EEI's and
NEMA's permission to use the EEI Master Agreement as the basis for the
proposed tariff.  Please note that on the cover page of the proposed tariff
attribution to the copyright owners has been provided as requested by EEI
and NEMA.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

AT&T may begin suspension of some Enron Corporate cell phone accounts beginning Friday, 12/7.  All remaining Portland cell phone accounts will be terminated no later than 12/11.  

Individual cell phone users may keep their phone and phone number by accepting financial responsibility for the account going forward.  You may convert your phone to a personal account and request the same phone number or request a new one.

"RE: CalPX Collateral Issue","This is a quick note to let the team know that I do have the credit worthiness requirements for PX (FERC Electric Service Tariff, Art. 2.4); a summary could be prepared if needed.   I trust that the Team would benefit from a legal opinion on Art. 2.4.5, and the associated schedule 2 of the tariff  related to ""Changes in the Amount of Security Provided by a PX Participant""  which allows a refund of securities above the PX security Amount.  As Steve mentioned nicely below, if the security amount is zero, then perhaps there is an argument for a full refund.

On the same theme, I am investigating  the requirements for maintaining ESP (electricity service provider) in California.  One of the conditions is that the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO.  If the CA ISO also necessitates participant status in the PX for  some transactions, then there is a circular flow in the argument, and may be there is a need to maintain a form of relationship with the PX.

I shall keep you posted with progress.

Subject:	CalPX Collateral Issue

Thanks Steve.  With your input, my take on Elizabeth's questions are:

1.	Must we renew the collateral?-  From a legal standpoint the answer is ""No"" for the reasons discussed below.  However, as we know, the PX will take a contrary position and has (along with other California parties) taken the position at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of the CA refund case at FERC (to secure payment of refunds due).

2.	May we replace the letters of credit with cash / other collateral?-  The answer is ""Yes"" as you note below, with the caveat that the replacement collateral must be acceptable to the PX.  Obviously cash should be acceptable.  Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option.

3.	What is the potential outcome if we do nothing (i.e. we don't re-up the letters of credit).  Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration.

As for additional options, we could consider:

1. 	Further to Steve's option 1, we might try to enforce the return of the excess in court by submitting a Section 2.5 request to the PX and bringing the issue to a head.  Steve's original option is preferable, however, since it is through agreement with the PX.  Perhaps a compromise could be proposed for the PX to return our collateral over and above our highest potential refund liability to the PX in the CA refund case.	

2.	Seeking injunctive relief in court to prevent the PX from drawing on the letter of credit.

Elizabeth, please advise if this answers your questions fully.

Thanks,  Ray

Subject:	RE: 

I agree. 

Schedule 2, section 2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall post collateral for 100 % of its requirements in excess of the unsecured line of credit in order to participate in the CTS and Core Markets""  [I would note that (1) our ""requirements"" are currently zero, and (2) we do not wish, nor is it possible to ""participate"" in the CTS and Core Markets.  Therefore, the PX has no basis under its Tariff to continue to hold our collateral.]

As you indicated below, Schedule 2, section 2.2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall maintain sufficient collateral to cover its aggregate outstanding liabilities in the Day-Ahead and Day-Of markets to and from the PX between cash clearing cycles or during the period in which the liabilities are incurred and when payment is billed and settled.""  

Options:

1.  If the PX will allow us to have access to our excess cash pursuant to Section 2.5 (requests submitted by COB Wednesday will be processed by Friday), then let them cash in the LC.

2.  Ask the PX if we can substitute ""other liquid collateral acceptable to the PX. .  .in lieu of cash"" (Schedule 2, section 2.1.3).  We should ask them what else would be acceptable (a lien on Jeff Skilling's house?).

Steve, I believe that schedule 2, section 2.2 of the CalPX tariff is the provision that requires market participants to maintain collateral, the purpose of which, however, is to provide security for liabilities incurred in the PX markets.  Since these markets are no longer in operation, there is no lawful reason to withhold the collateral, notwithstanding the assertions of CA parties that it should be used to guarantee payment of refunds ordered in the CA refund proceeding at FERC.

Elizabeth, per our conversation, I am obtaining and attaching various pleadings before FERC I've worked on seeking return of the collateral and the reasons why it should not be withheld by the PX.  It's my understanding that these might help- please let me know.  There are other related filings and I will forward them as soon as I locate.  In the meantime, I am working with Steve Hall to get an independent interpretation of the PX tariff so as to yield answers to our questions and our options.  Thanks,  Ray

Subject:	Credit worthiness - Alberta



Please find below the creditworthiness criteria for Alberta Pool.  I appreciate the help of Fino and Guillermo.
  

The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows: 
Rating		trading limit
AAA		$25,000,000
AA		$20,000,000
A		$15,000,000
BBB		$10,000,000
<BBB		$0

Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.  

If a participant's financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.

It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rating within 2 business days.

The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of default for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial position within 2 business days of said default or change.

"Prepay Transactions:  Physical and Swaps","
To my knowledge there are a variety of prepay forms of transactions.  
1.  Some older forms were physically based (I think primarily with respect to gas and with Chase).  Teresa Bushman and/or Dan Lyons worked on these transactions).  
2.  Newer forms are triangulated swaps.  There are a series with Citibank, related to credit link notes (see Gareth Bahlmann re link notes), known as Yosemite/Delta Transactions.  There are 4 in the series (4th series had three prepays, US, Sterling and Euro).  The 5th did not close.  
3.  There is at least one other with Citibank, dated June 2001 and it is being wrapped into the pipeline credit facility and will be extinguished via the placement of the pipeline facility.  
4.  I am aware of one other (via the London office) which was extended September 2001, among Credit Suisse First Boston and ENA and Barclays.  

I suggest you contact Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Dan Boyle to determine a complete list.  I believe that this detail may have been determined by one of the teams formed last week.  You may wish to check with Haedicke.
In respect of accounting treatment, and book treatment, I suggest the following names:  Alan Quaintance, Clint Walden re accounting.  Dan Boyle has a name of someone who worked on placing the Delta transactions in the risk books, but I cannot remember the name.

"Counterparty Guarantor Addendum to Adoption Agreement","Various discussions took place Friday afternoon as to advisability of inserting a provision designed to bind (or at least make an attempt to bind ) current Counterparty Guarantors to obligations under the Adoption Agreement/ERMT Master Agreements.  

A quick fix that ""hopefully"" does not significantly disrupt the work you may have already done on your Adoption Agreements is to insert the language contained in the attached document just below the signature lines of all Adoption Agreements, only in those cases where the Master being adopted is currently supported by a guaranty issued by Counterparty's parent or other credit support provider/guarantor.  The required revisions to the form language should be fairly self-explanatory, but please call me with any questions.

If you see problems with the specific language (not the idea) of the Addendum, please call me ASAP. 

Thanks for your understanding and assistance,

Steve

For the Financial Masters I will draft and email shortly another paragraph that will need to be added to the Adoption Agreement to cover the situation where the counterparty has provided a parent guaranty under the ENA Master Agreement.  The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it ""reinserts"" the Schedule C with Credit information.

I attended a very early GISB meeting where they were discussing this, and

     Please see attached.  While I am not opposed to the formation of the
ESIB, I have several concerns based on preliminary indications that the
EISB will publish a ""standardized"" contract for wholesale power
transactions.  I'd like to avoid a third or even fourth (if you consider
ERCOT still to be a viable option) U.S. based wholesale power agreement.
As it appears that the formation of EISB is going forward, and has FERC
endorsement, it might be worthwhile to attend this workshop.  Please let me
know your thoughts.

We wanted to provide you information about this upcoming meeting, which
may be of interest to your company.  We would appreciate it if you would
pass this along to the appropriate member of your staff.

EEI will conduct a one-day workshop to focus issues and discuss options
related to the formation of the Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB).
The workshop will take place on Friday, November 9, at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.   The meeting will take
place from  8 a.m. - 4 p.m.  The purpose of the meeting is to gather EEI
member input on EISB formation issues related to both wholesale and retail
electric standards.

As you know, the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) recently expanded its
charter to include the development of electricity standards.  FERC Chairman
Pat Wood has endorsed this action, as well as Commissioner Massey and
Commissioner Brownell.  Business practice standardization issues will be
discussed this week at the FERC RTO workshops, focusing on a potential
regulatory role in defining candidates for standardized business practices.

For hotel accommodations, please contact the hotel directly at 972-453-1234
and ask for the EEI GISB-EISB special room rate of $119/night.

A meeting registration information and response form is attached.  We will
provide briefing materials to workshop participants in advance of the
meeting.

For additional information, please contact Dave Dworzak, Manager,
Transmission Policy at 202-508-5684 or at ddworzak@eei.org if you have any
questions or need more information.

Subject:	East Power Meeting

We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

"RE: East Power Meeting","I believe Wabash has also terminated.
 
Don,
As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.   Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.   I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.
 
I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm.

Subject: East Power Meeting



We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts. 

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week. 

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002 
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002 
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002 
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).

Ameren Energy 
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks, 

Don

Please let us know if we are ok to send these out.

Thanks,

MDEA
purchase power for the cities
purchase and schedule gas as agent to supply the cities generating units
real-time operational coordination via our control room to balance the cities load and resources

MDEA relies entirely on EPMI for this as they have no other enabling agreements or marketing/scheduling capability.  We are no longer able to purchase power for them but are able to schedule gas as their agent.  The sities could incur signifigant imbalance charges as a result of our inability to perform.

 

QSE Customers

Green Mountain Power (BP Energy), New Power Company, XERS (starts Jan 1) 

We schedule all power contracts with ERCOT
We settle all charges and payments with ERCOT (ERCOT settles with EPMI and EPMI settles with customer)

 

Frontera

We market the output of the Frontera plant (450 MW) 
We buy to suppy Frontera's obligations (call options to EPMI and Mirant) when the market is below Frontera's cost.
We schedule all transactions as QSE

Frontera has no other enabling agreements and relies on EPMI for all trading activities.

"RE: The mystery is over!!","
Much truth in this rapier thrust of humor.  As I continue to reflect on events, rumors and speculations, it strikes me that the Enron story seems to be unfolding as a story that is all about a kind of Rogue upper management thing.  The traditional fear of rogue trading, where a trader has control of the back office and spins off into a series of trades, each one designed to offset a previous bad one until the whole house of cards tumbles down,  this prototypical risk was carefully managed at Enron.  We actually have a very high quality trading business with good legal, accounting and settlement processes in place.  What we didn't have covered was a king of rogue financial sorcery thing by the very top executives.  Rogue balance sheet shenanigans  seems to be the problem.  It is a kind of corruption that is difficult to isolate and purge ourselves of.  Instead of isolating a single bad guy and firing him and then telling everybody all is well, this   kind of corruption seems to call for a  revolution from below, or, as seems increasingly likely, a takeover from without.   ----cgy

The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If there aren't any, they invent some.
They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.



American Democracy

After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/ equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Bryce,

I spoke with Scott Borgmeyer of Florida Power and Light and FPL Energy Power Mktg.
concerning their payments that are due on December 17th and December 26th.
 According to Scott, they will not be making payments to us on these days due to the termination 
of their contract effective December 12th.  They will not be paying at this time due to unwinding 
arrangements of terminated contracts.  Payment amounts due are as follows:

December 17th	$21,064,010.57  FP&L

December 26th  $ 6,965,765.30   FP&L

December 26th  $     22,077.24   FPL Energy Power Marketing

Thanks,

Max

perfection, a majority of the grapes for Turning Leaf were selected
from some of the finest vineyards in the Lodi region. A major
winegrape-growing region since the 1850s, Lodi is increasingly
looked to by leading California wineries for grapes of superior
quality. The warm days and cool nights of its Mediterranean climate
allow the grapes to develop excellent color and maintain crisp acid
levels through to harvest. The end result is a well-balanced
fruit-forward Chardonnay with excellent varietal
character.</span></p>

"FW: Set-Off Language","For our call this afternoon.  This is very helpful.  I ta slo sounds complicated, but I think you will se that absent a perfect world, Robert is suggesting only minor changes to the set-off clause previuosly circulated by Mark for EWS trading contracts.  Roberts has also attached more fully developed provisions for both triangular set-off and for square set-off (which would be applicable under the Master Netting and Collateral Contract) which address the issues of mutuality, privity and consideration in greater detail.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	""ROBERT ANDERSON"" <robert.anderson@blakes.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22ROBERT+20ANDERSON+22+20+3Crobert+2Eanderson+40blakes+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com] 
Sent:	Wednesday, August 15, 2001 9:22 PM
To:	Keohane, Peter
Subject:	Set-Off Language

  Further to our conversations yesterday and today, I attach the following:

1.  Memorandum of Square Set-Off Combinations;
2.  Memorandum of Triangular Set-Off Combinations;
3.  Mandatory Set-Off Language for EWS Trading Contracts -  Revision #1, blacklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke;
4.  Clean copy of attachment 3;
5.  Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions; and
6.  Square Set-Off Provision

This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment.  At your request I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts as well as the set-off language in the draft Master Netting Set-Off and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of set-off that will be enforceable in Canada.  (For the moment, I have considered the laws applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner, Kevin McElcheran).

Unlike certain jurisdictions (including, for example, Great Britain), in Canada  a creditor's set-off rights are generally preserved in an insolvency.  Section 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 as amended and section 18.1 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, S.C. 1985 c. C-36 as amended, both expressly reserve application of the law of set-off in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply.  Contractual set-off provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provided the contract of which the set-off provision is part is itself enforceable (i.e. has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privity and consideration).

Set-off is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar-for-dollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent company.  This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who would otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the setting-off creditor to the insolvent company.

The essence of set-off is mutuality: the setting-off of a claim and cross-claim between the same parties.  The difficulty with the expansive set-off terms sought by Enron is that they would permit ""set-off"" as between Enron and its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party.  My concern is that such purported ""set-off"" is so different in substance from the common notion of set-off which requires mutuality, as to be set-off in name only.  Without mutuality, I am concerned that a court may not recognize such ""set-off"" of obligations relating to third parties as ""set-off"" within the meaning of Canadian insolvency legislation.  The concern is not only that a court may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolvent state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estate's indebtedness to a creditor.  The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purports to do that as something other than set-off known under the laws of Canada.  I am not, however, aware of any case law on point.

With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality, I have incorporated language (referred to in the materials as an ""aggregate liability clause"") to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and cross-claim will be between the same parties.

The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in square and triangular set-off.  These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim and cross-claim.

Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts (attachment 3), I have the following comments:

1.    I have included wording to clarify that the option to set-off is to be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates.  The reason for this is to avoid the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to exercise inconsistent set-off options.  We must assume that this set-off provision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and various Enron affiliates.  If the counterparty defaults on more than one of these contracts, (or if they contain cross-default provisions,) the Enron affiliate that is a party to each separate contract would be ""X"" under that contract and would have the option to exercise the set-off rights thereunder including the right to set-off against amounts it owes, amounts that are owed to any of its affiliates.  Those affiliates may each in turn be ""X"" under their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise set-off rights.  While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsistently in exercising set-off rights, making it clear that the option to set-off must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates, minimizes any attack of the set-off provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to set-off.

2.  With respect to the requirement that the set-off contract must have consideration, I have included an acknowledgement by the parties (including affiliates) that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants involved.  This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of consideration but is helpful.

3.  Paragraph (B) is included to address the mutuality requirement by including an aggregate liability clause, as discussed above.

4.  In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts, the changes to the sentence including ""limitation to"" have been made to clarify that the set-off provision is without limitation to any other rights which X or its affiliates may have.  I was concerned that the ""without prejudice"" language in the prior draft, would leave it open to the defaulting party to argue that the set-off provision cannot work to its prejudice.

5.  The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an attempt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved.  In attachment 3 I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is not as clear and certain as it might be.  I have also attached a revised triangular set-off provision (attachment 5) which is clearer, more certain and about one page longer.

Finally, I have included a square set-off provision (attachment 6) which affords Enron (and any non-defaulting counterparty) even better set-off protection.  As discussed, I will include this provision in the Master, Netting Setoff and Security Agreement form.

I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience.

Please review the following draft e-mail that I would like to send to the CAISO.  As Elizabeth is aware, the CAISO wants some assurance from us or it will stop accepting our schedules.



Keoni,

This e-mail confirms our conversation of a few minutes ago.  You, Phil Lieber, and I discussed how EPMI will continue to meet its SC obligations during the coming weeks.

1.  EPMI will notify the CAISO of any anticipated material negative deviations, e.g., if our counterparties are suspending power deliveries to us.

2.  EPMI is currently owed money by the CAISO, which is sufficient to cover any anticipated imbalance charges, GMCs, etc.

3.  In the event that Enron Corp. files for bankruptcy, EPMI will seek bankruptcy court approval to pay the CAISO any amounts required under the CAISO Tariff to establish creditworthiness in order to maintain EPMI's SC status. EPMI will seek this approval as soon as possible; however, the CAISO understands that this process will not be immediate.

4.  The CAISO is working to set up a new SC identification code to identify EPMI as a post-petition SC.

5.  I will continue to be a single point of contact for the CAISO and will assume

"RE:","Steve, I believe that schedule 2, section 2.2 of the CalPX tariff is the provision that requires market participants to maintain collateral, the purpose of which, however, is to provide security for liabilities incurred in the PX markets.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

State PUC seeks to void Davis' power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Monday, October 1, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/01/MN48825.DTL>
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
""The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,"" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. ""I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down."" 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
""It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
""It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,"" Hidalgo said. ""If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up."" 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
""We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,"" Lynch said last week. ""We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
""The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,"" he said. ""Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract."" 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
""Now another California agency is disputing it,"" Mitchell said. ""We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored."" 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
""News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,"" the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. 
PG&E'S PLANT PROPOSAL
PG&E Corp. has proposed to emerge from bankruptcy protection by transferring all the power plants it still owns, as well as its natural gas and power transmission lines, into subsidiaries free of state regulation. 
PG&E says it will protect consumers from a replay of this year's price spikes by selling the power from its new free-market plants at a stable rate through contracts that phase out in nine to 12 years. 
Consumer advocates and state regulators say that stable rate -- 5 cents a kilowatt hour -- is more than 60 percent higher than PG&E now gets under state regulation. 
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County), warned that the state could be heading into a second wave of the energy crisis. 
""The problem with this new phase we're going into is that the concepts are more theoretical and the impacts are very much delayed,"" Keeley said. ""There won't be the same urgency to wrestle this energy monster to the ground.""

Subject:	RE: Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable Financing

Since all receivables that meet the definition of Receivables are transfered from ENA to Swee'P [the first step in the 2 step sale process to ASCC], I think what we need to consider is a mechanism to remove account obligors from the program as we execute new master netting agreements [and also carve out PGE going forward]. This may entail an ammendment to the Transfer Agreement between ENA and Swee'p to carve out whatever is on a schedule, and have ENA change that schedule from time to time....I will need to consider in light of Swee'P being a QSPE, and the ""brain dead"" characteristics of Swee'P.

According to the monthly settlement report for September, PG&E Corporation had a balance of $8,676,000 for physical gas receivables, a concentration limit of $3,340,000 and an excess concentration limit of $5,336,000 -- I assume that the amount reflected in the concentration limit was included in determining ASCC's ownership interest in the pool of receivables, and that the assumption below is incorrect.

I assume, unless I hear from Joel or Tim to the contrary, that none of the PGE Entities receivables were included in the referenced financing, and therefore, the financing does not relate to the master netting agreement between the PGE Entities and various Enron entities.

At this time no further master netting agreements should be implemented without coordination with Ephross on these issues in respect of the inclusion of physical gas contracts.

New Power wants to close out their gas hedge positions.  Under which Enron entity were these financial deals confirmed.  It probably makes sense to have them execute the opposite trades within the same legal entity to improve netting rights and cap exposure by entity.

Please advise so I can inform the EES trading desk and ENA trading desk of how to proceed.

"EEI Contract/Future Meetings","
Members, Drafting Group:
 
Following Monday's meeting, I would like to confirm the meeting dates that  we discussed for 4 future Contract Group activities:
 
December 6, 2001.  - Executive/Drafting Committee  - Discuss RTO Products.WSPP, Canadian Update. 
 
Mitch Dutton has confirmed that the Executive/Drafting Committee can meet  in AEP's offices in Columbus, 28th floor Conference Room. Let's start at  10:30 unless we find that your planes get in much earlier.
  
Mitch will provide address, transportation information from the airport and  building access information (as well as Columbus' best lunchl).  
 
Please RSVP to Cynthia Trueheart, Ed's assistant, (202) 508 5619 (or  by replying to this message) and include your arrival and departure times so we  can set precise meeting times. 
 
February 5 or 7, 2002.- Working Group meeting to  present the Collateral Annex, and other pending issues 
 
EEI's Offices have space for up to 100 people.  Do you have any  preference for February 5 (Tuesday) or 7 (Thursday)? Let Cynthia know.
 
May 2, 2002.  Training Seminar in conjunction with  EEI Legal Conference.  Bishops' Lodge, Santa Fe. NM.  
 
The Legal Conference begins with a reception Wednesday evening, May 1 and  continues through Saturday, May 4.  We would devote the first full day, May  2, to Contract issues, including a Trading Basics review and more in-depth  discussion of the Collateral Annex, new RTO Products and a Canadian annex.   While rooms at Bishop's Lodge are limited, we are looking into nearby hotels for  additional rooms. 
 
June 3 or 4, 2002.  Executive/Drafting Committee  meets during EEI Convention.
 
The EEI Convention takes place Sunday June 2 thru Tuesday June 4 at the  Boston Marriorr Copley Place Hotel.  the Convention is open to the public,  includes many interesting presentatons, a large trade show and a very nice party  on the last night.  EEI also conducts members-only business meetings in  between conventino events.  It attracts over 1000 people.  
 
We can easily meet there. I will most likely have the most free time on  Tuesday, June 4, but will confirm that shortly.
 
Canadian Issues.  Hans  Konow, President of the Canadian Electric Association, is very interested in  participating in the development of a Canadian Annex to the EEI  Contract.  CEA is usually ery easy to work with and would play the same role as EEI and  NEMA did in the initial stages - bring together interested parties and serve as  a neutral.  I expect to hear back from his staff soon.  
 
Your TO DOs:  Please RSVP for the Dec. 6 meeting  in Columbus with arrival and departure times and indicate whether you prefer  February 5 or 7 for a Working Group meeting.

Willis,

We've reviewed the application Enron submitted for participation in Virtual
Transactions.  In order to complete the registration process, the following
points need to be addressed:

a)  The Acknowledgement and Certification for participation in Virtual
Transactions has been determined to be incomplete.  We've discussed that
the document notes Enron North America as the applicant.  If this is the
case, we will need additional information, including signed tariff
agreements, in order to process this application.  If the applicant is one
of our current Enron affiliates which are NYISO market participants, Enron
Energy Services, or Enron Power Marketing, the Acknowledgement and
Certification document needs to be revised and resubmitted, with of course,
a value of the mwhs intended for bidding.

b)  The registration material indicates that Enron intends to submit an
Irrevocable Letter of Credit.  Please advise if you intend to submit our
standard format, which is included in the NYISO Financial Assurance Policy
(Addendum B of the Registration Packet).  For your convenience, the Packet
is attached.  If you plan on submitting any other format, be it your own,
or a revised version of the standard format, you should forward a draft of
that document as soon as possible.  A review fee of $500 would apply, as
outlined in the Financial Assurance Policy.  Please advise if you wish us
to review the document.  If so, we will forward you wire transfer
information for the fee processing.

If you have any questions, please contact me or your Customer Relations
Representative.

"Summary of  WSPP meeting","
Listening in by phone is so much better than traveling to these meetings.  It greatly reduces one's exposure to the toxins of this process. 

1. A learned expert on Secured Transactions  from Mike's firm gave an opening address on the principles of granting and receiving the grantation of security interests.  Almost completely irrelevant. The guy up and suggested that for a given transaction, the parties might consider giving a security interest in an office building, ie.real estate,  as collateral.

2. A cannabalized EEI Credit Support Annex  was tabled by Deedee Russo of Reliant and muddled through.  The format was typically:  
   Mike:  ""Okay guys, why don't you explain to me what you want.""  
   Member:  ""We think we need this...blah blah blah, ""
   Mike:  ""Okay, we'll put that into our next draft and have a conference call in December and a meeting in   January and remember, none of this is binding, its all optional."" 

3.  At the very end, a lawyer from PacifiCorp managed to raise the vital issue and Mike got his hackles up very quickly.  The PacifiCorp guy was basically saying that the WSPP was becoming more and more like the EEI and that this made it more and more difficult for parties to decide which agreement to use.  His implication was that the WSPP should try to remain different or throw in the towel and be just like the EEI.  Small reacted from a position of religion, dogmatically and loudly asserting that the two agreements were fundamentally different.   Here is where he left himself open to the shining light of rational analysis:  if someone, had the time,  and we thought it mattered enough, the approach to take would be this:  

Dispassionate Spokesperson:  A question has been raised:  is the WSPP agreement becoming more or less like the EEI?  To fairly answer this question one needs to look at all the changes that have been made by  the WSPP in the last three years, comparing each change to the EEI agreement.   (prepare comparison document).  If we look at the evidence do we see convergence or divergence?  The answer will be overwhelmingly convergence.  If this objective study could be placed before the ""Membership"" it would speak for itself.  Nobody would have to utter a word.  The comparison document would do the job.  If we are going to bother playing with these guys, this is what we should do. It would take some time, but if we circulated it to the membership and then merely raised the question of future direction, we might deal this tedious process a mortal blow. 

 Believe it or not, the solution to  this process is to follow the same process that went on when the King James Bible was put together in 1611.  Various scholars took various views on how various Hebrew passages should be translated, and it took a committee of draftsmen, appointed and sent to Geneva  by King James  to pound out the form that has stood the test of time for centuries. The Joint Drafting Committee's time on the historical stage is finally arriving.  I am going to talk to this Pacificorp fellow and Brenda Anderson at BPA and see what happens.     ----cgy

"West Power Prepays","Attached please find a spreadsheet that describes the prepays we completed this week.  In summary, we bought power supplies through December 31 from Allegheny, AEP, Avista, Idacorp, and PNM and delivered to over 15 in the money contracts.  The power cost approximately $3.3MM and will generate a post-petition receivable in excess of $12MM.  Next week we will identify the January schedule and recommended purchases/deliveries.  Apologies for any wiring firedrills.

"HYDA +3","

Hall Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Monday, November 12, 2001:   +3

A number of relatively positive factors are offset by the single negative factor that the good old days are forever gone. The free fall seems to have ended.   Lots of cash is coming in.  Portland office is apparently to be spared a misery that  Houston will not be so fortunate as to escape,  and is given a clear message to resume work as usual.  Street Oracle  carping and whining at low level of hysteria.   

Perhaps a key subliminal message can be divined from the fact that Tim went to Houston carrying  full documentation and prepared to hand in all of his expense reports, but came back without having turned anything in at all,   flying back home on the jetstream,  much like the single crow that sailed by today,  heading due north high above the center of the Willamette, as though it knew exactly where it was going.

"VEPCO","Kevin and Elizabeth,

Attached is a proposal summarizing our restructuring talks with VEPCO last week.  We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They'd requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.

Discussion summary:
Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).
Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.
VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).
Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index
Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany
Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary
Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01

Just a quick update on the LC situation.  We sent a renewal request to Enserco yesterday and they said they would get back to us tomorrow.  If they don't renew by tomorrow I think that we should send them a notice of Event of Default letter which would give them until Wednesday to cure.  If not cured by Wednesday, we could terminate and be in a position to draw on Thursday/Friday.  Who can I coordinate with next week on this?

Leslie Reeves is checking on a few of them that owe payments this week to see if they have paid.

On Vitol, Tom is obtaining a copy of the LC and seeing if they have paid.  He is also checking into Ballarpur.

Greg Johnston e-mailed me to say that they were handling EPCORE and Engage.

We have concluded that nothing can be done on Energy Service Providers, Trafigura and Glencore.

It has become clear that we cannot save ourselves, and so, a takeover would seem to be better than bankruptcy.  Through thick fog it seems that Wall Street banks (lenders to Enron) may favor a Dynegy takeover to the alternative,  and  the Moody downgrade fell just short of the junk bond line.  Tim Belden and Chris Calger flying to Houston means Portland's voice may be heard at one of the many tables in the many board rooms, but is offset by the fact that Tracy Ngo was seen in the photocopy room, rushing to get six months of expense reports submitted to Houston for payout.  

And, the crows were seen swarming out over the calm waters of the river, circling above the waters as if expecting to see something below, eventually rising up in a flock to lead the way south ahead of Tim and Chris.

"We have resolved the BPA-James River contract","All,

I am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous James River contract with BPA under favorable terms.  The signed agreements are on my desk right now.  Besides significantly reducing our litigation risk, the addition of 7.5 MW/h and the change of delivery point have added $22.8 million to the value of the contract.

BPA and EPMI have amended the original contract to specify that (i) BPA will deliver 102 MW/h 24/7 for the 5-year term of the agreement (an increase of 7.5 MW/h over the original), (ii) the disputed ""alternative delivery point"" is designated as Mid-C, (iii) all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement, (iv) the parties agree to ""book out"" the James River physical deliveries against EPMI sales to BPA at the Mid-C delivery point (so no power will flow); and (v) we will continue to invoice BPA each month for the term of the agreement, just as if the power was still flowing.

Although my preference would have been to terminate the James River agreement, BPA refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates.  Similarly, I had hoped that we could do a one-time book-out, but BPA refused to do so because--according to BPA's finance person---such a book-out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring BPA to use mark-to-market accounting.  Therefore, we executed two documents:  one amending the original contract, and another called the ""Book-Out Agreement,"" which sets out an agreement to book-out specific transactions over the next five years.  

I am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for EPMI because (1) we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point, which (2) will make it very difficult for BPA to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to James River, and (3) the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over $22 million in value to the contract.  

Thanks to everyone for your help.

To All:
 
Please let me know your availability for a conference call  next week on 10/1-10/3 or 10/5 at 2pm Eastern TIme to discuss the  following:
 
1) Getting a EEI Contract Working Group organizational plan in  place asap.  The best antidote for preventing an Energy Industry Standards  Board from taking over the EEI Contract management is to have a separate,  well-defined and broadly-supported group in place.
 
3) Agenda and schedule for the next meeting of the Working  Group.
 
3) Adding new members to the drafting committe.  In  particular, Noel Trask of the Excelon Power Team has asked to join.
 
ASAP, I would like to get the optional provisions  circulated earlier this week up on the website and through the listserver   along w/ the announcement of our organizational proposal and future working  group meetings.
 
Thanks.

"Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info","As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

"Re: administrative claims-pg & e","Lisa,

I am comfortable that the order setting the administrative claim bar date applies only to claims arising from the post-petition sale of power through the CAISO.  My understanding, based on an email from John, is that power sales under bilateral contracts, such as the EPMI power contract, do not go through the ISO.  Assuming that is correct (and if John or Elizabeth disagree, please let me know immediately), I am comfortable that there is no need to file an administrative claim for power sales under the EPMI contract for the period April 6 to April 9.

Similarly, the post-petition negative CTC claim does not arise from the sale of power through the ISO.  Thus, there is no need to file an administrative claim for it at this time.

"EEI Comments","Liz:
Here is a summary of comments I have not yet incorporated:

1.	Fritz raised the point that if Fixed Independent Amount is selected then both parties could be posting collateral.  If this occurs, he thinks that only Sections 6, 7 and 9 should apply but that Sections 3 and 4 should not.

2.	In clause (b) of the definition of Exposure, should we add language at the end that says:  ""when such sum is a positive value, and when such sum is a negative value it represents, conversely, Exposure of Party Y to Party X.

3.	Fritz wanted to eliminate the ""demand"" requirement in Section 4 and make collateral posting automatic.

4.	Should we eliminate the consent requirement in the last sentence of Section 5(a) (reducing LC's)?

5.	Reliant wanted to delete the ""mid point"" language in the definition of Current mark to Market value.

6.	Reliant wants to add to Section 6(b)(iii) the phrase ""Secured Party notifies the Pledging party as to the"" after the 1 and 5 day triggers such that the delivery requirement begins after notice.

7.	Reliant wants to extend the time frames in Section 8. 	

8.	AEP wants to limit the definition of Credit Rating Event to a ratings drop only.

9.	  AEP wants to add language to the definition of Letter of Credit that requires it to be acceptable to the Secured Party.

I will forward to you PacifiCorp's and Duke's comments as I found most of them to be problematic.

I think it would be helpful going forward to elicit the counterparty's

its jurisdiction of organization and location of chief executive office.

"Collateral and LC Issues","Brent and Sara:
Here is where we ended up yesterday after discussing the LC situation with Debbie:

1.	Debbie and her group will initially review each LC that has been posted to Enron to determine if it is ""transaction specific"" or if it covers all trades with the counterparty.  If it is transaction specific and the counterparty has performed, then no further action is required.  If the counterparty has not performed then Debbie will work with us to see if a draw can be made.

2.	If the LC covers all trades, Debbie will send copies of the LC and the transactions docs to me and we will determine what rights, if any, we have to draw.  Each month, we will focus on those LC's that are due to expire that month.    

Call me if you have any questions.  We will distribute the work to the trading lawyers as the need arises.

"","Reliant has proposed a change to the assignment language as set forth below:

(c)  This Agreement, the Underlying Master Agreements and Transactions thereunder, and any rights to amounts payable to a Party thereunder, shall not be assigned by any Enron Party or any Counterparty Party without the prior written consent of Counterparty Party or Enron Party, respectively, which consent may be given or withheld at the sole discretion of the non-assigning Party, except (i) as expressly set forth herein and (ii) pursuant to a.

We need to clarify in the last sentence that the assignment upon merger may occur without consent upon a merger event.  I've got a call into Dede to find out why they are deleting the right to assign pursuant to a transfer of substantially all of the assets.

"RE: the long knives come out","
Financial sorcery seems to be the key concept.  Whereas most trading companies live in mortal fear of the rogue trader, and I honestly think Enron has built controls to prevent this specie from flourishing here, we seem to have been infected with a rogue financial sorcery cell, a small group of highly persuasive individuals who mesmerized the Board and the Street to a most memorable degree.  What do shareholders do when their Board has been hypnotized by the CEO and CFO?  It's ugly. ----cgy

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 	 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 	Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com> Senior Columnist 10/24/2001 06:40 PM EDT	
Enron's problems won't go out the door with Andrew Fastow. 
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the executive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this deal, and others, <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002702.html> have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54% in just seven days. 
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group. 
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to show that the ""Fastow era"" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2. 
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct. 
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a difficult conference call Tuesday, <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html> CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company? 
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence. 
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board. 
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed the LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders. 
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency. 
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?

Subject:	nepool financial assurance



I got a call today from Ed McKenna, the ISO-NE treasurer.  He is getting a large volume of calls from NEPOOL Participants concerned about Enron Corp's credit rating.  He is telling these Participants that his office only monitors whether NEPOOL members EPMI and EES are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy, which they are, and does not monitor Enron Corp.  Ed suggested that when PG&E experienced difficulties PG&E drafted a short notice, which ISO-NE circulated, explaining how its subsidiaries were not affected by the credit rating of the parent.  The ISO is offering us the same opportunity to draft and circulate something similar if we wish.

What may be going on here is a concern by NEPOOL Participants that we are using a parent guaranty to meet the Financial Assurance Policy.  My recollection, however, is that we have instead posted surety bonds from AA agencies to meet NEPOOL credit requirements.  If we disclosed this to the NEPOOL Participants it might allay their credit concerns.  We may however, not want to disclose this if we are employing parent guarantees elsewhere, lest we be asked to post surety bonds everywhere.  Can you discuss this with the traders and see what they want to do?

"Mandatory Set-Off Language","Elizabeth, please call me to let me know how you want to proceed on this.

I reviewed with Mary last week the set-of language for the trading forms in light of Robert Anderson's review and suggested revisions.  Mary had reviewed the language with your outside counsel and for reasons, most of which I did not necessarily follow to be honest, they were not agreeable to Robert's suggested revisions (other than the ""without limitation"" language (which I note has now been inserted only in part, and therefore may still problematic, in that it refers to being without limitation to either party's rights, which would include the defaulting party's right to object to the enforceability of the entire set-off provision or to assert some alternate form of set-off arrangement)).  I agreed with Mary that I would again review that matter with Robert.

I have again reviewed the matter with Robert, and he remains concerned with the language as is, since the triangular set-off as proposed without also dealing with the issue of mutuality, which is fundamental to the concept of set-off, results in a contractual agreement (assuming that we get past the privity and consideration issues), to call something ""set-off"" that fundamentally is not set-off.  Robert's concern is that if the issue of mutuality is not addressed the current language could be viewed by a court not as set-off but as an assignment of a third obligation as security, that may be unenforceable for various reasons, including non-perfection.

Robert also makes the following points:

1.  His suggested revisions already are a compromise from what he believes would be required in a more detailed provision addressing these complex issues;

2.  To the extent that we introduce triangular set-off that may not ultimately be enforceable, we are running the risk of the entire clause not be allowed by the courts, and therefore having no right to set-off;

3.  As drafting points, the ""without limitation"" language still provides the defaulting party with an argument to avoid the entire arrangement, and there is no specified date for the currency conversion;

4.  In terms of the issue of consideration, it is an issue of contract formation, which is fundamental to a contractual right of set-off;

5.  In terms of when the mutuality of the obligations arises, he is agrees that it would be best that it arise form inception, but he thought that would be difficult to sell commercially, and therefore setled on default but prior to elected termination.

In short, Robert's point is that even with his revisions he would have concerns, but without his revisions he has serious concerns around enforceability, and it is difficult for me to simply ignore his advice given both his reasoning and my experience with Robert's advice.

In terms of where to go, I think there are the following solutions:

1.  We can see this as a Canadian issue, and therefore incorporate Robert's changes in the Canadian forms only - physical and financial;

2.  We can have Robert speak to your outside counsel and see if they can't come to some common ground on more universal language;

3.  We can leave the matter as is for all forms.

(I am more comfortable with 1 than 3.)

Why don't you give me a call.  I am sure we all want to move past this and, ackowledginging the risks, simply need to agree on a definitive approach.

Peter.

Attached is a draft termination letter for the respective Master Agreements, including the ISDA. The assignment documentation in respect of the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, Master Purchase & Sale Agreement and the Master Energy Purchase & Sale Agreement does not address the notice address, however the Master Netting Agreement is clear in that if there are any inconsistencies notice shall be effective if given in accordance with the Master Netting Agreement.
	
The termination of the Underlying Agreements is based upon a failure to provide Collateral.
	
Also attached is a draft termination letter in respect of the Qualified Scheduling Entity Services Agreement, which provides that either party can terminate on provision of 60 days prior written notice delivered during the first 180 days commencing June 1, 2001.

"Project Notre Dame - Change in Control","The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.  Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.  Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?  Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.  Thanks.

1.	Letter dated 11/30 from Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP covering (a) 5/11/99 Master Coal Purchase and Sale Agreement; (b) 1/1/99 Coal Purchase and Sale Agreement; (c) 11/1/92 Master Firm Purchase and Sale Agreement; (d) GISB confirms; and (e) emission transaction confirms with ENA, ENA II Corp., EGM, EPMI, ERMS and ENA Upstream.

2.	Letter dated 11/28 from Mirant Americas Energy Marketing LP covering (a) 4/1/97 Master energy Purchase and Sale Agreement; (b) 1/1/96 GISb; and (c) 6/1/94 ISDA.

3.	Letter dated 11/30 from Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. covering all transactions for the sale and purchase of natural gas.


Do these letters cover all of the Mirant relationships?  What does the collateral hat they are holding cover?  In the US, are we only out of the money on the EPMI trades?

1. Enron Corp. becomes/became insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they come due; and/or
2. there has/had occurred a default or other event relating to indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $100MM, which results in such indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable or capable of being declared immediately due and payable.

David, 
Sorry for the delay.  Here are drafts of the EEI Coversheet, Collateral Annex, and Paragraph 10 of the Collateral Annex.
The only change on the Collateral Annex is the legal name on your end.  Our contract is with ""Enron Power Marketing, Inc."", not ""Enron Corp.""
On Paragraph 10 of the Collateral Annex, there are two changes:  First, I have adjusted the threshold amounts for Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to reflect MidAmerican's credit policy.  Second, I have indicated that MidAmerican prefers Letters of Credit as collateral and would prefer not to exchange cash.
On the Coversheet, most changes (there aren't very many) are more editorial in nature.  The substantive issues appear to be related to Section 2.4 Transaction Terms and Conditions, Section 6.2 Timeliness of Payment, and the new section pertaining to Confirmation of EOL Transactions.
On Attachment A, I have also referenced a specific Schedule P product (Into Cinergy, Seller's Daily Choice)for the pre-existing transactions.
I think that we can resolve the remaining issues in a phone call and would like to do so as soon as possible (even today if that works).  
Please let me know if this will be possible. 
Thank you, 
Brian Wiese

We've updated the Merger Q&A document on our Enron Updates site ( http://home.enron.com/updates/mergerQA.html), as a result of the many questions you've had concerning the merger between Enron and Dynegy. Questions addressed include those about Enron stock options, benefits and immigration status. Please stay tuned for additional updates.

"FW: WSPP Proposal","
Here is a good example of exactly what I was talking about in our EEI/WSPP comparison session yesterday.  Today and tomorrow the WSPP contract committee is meeting in a palatial setting in southern California, many Club Members taking two and a half days off from their ""busy"" schedules to go there, AG warnings of terrorism threats notwithstanding, and, what are they doing?  they are discussing another piece of the EEI agreement and deciding whether or not to adopt it, (which they will in a botched up form)  this particular item is a Collateral Annex document, designed to strengthen the margin taking aspect of the WSPP agreement.  Nobody can complain that this topic is not a relevant topic,  but,  what nobody seems to be noticing, as the years go by, is that this catch up side show by these guys is a big waste of the industry's time and money, and, the whole thing could be brought to a tidy ending by a Joint WSPP/EEI drafting Committee.  Why should the market be confused by having two agreements, one of which is forever amending itself to look ever more and more like the other, all the while pretending to be vitally and significantly different?  The WSPP is like the Emperor's new clothes story.  It is proudly standing up there in front of the world but it has nothing on,  it looks ever more like the very agreement it tries to be different from.  This fundamental absurdity of creeping imitation needs to be recognized for what it is. This really is our biggest beef against the WSPP:  CREEPING IMITATION.   As mid-marketers, you could begin planting the seed of the idea, (couching it all in very positive remarks about the wonderful efforts of the WSPP),  that we have made enought progress now and that the time for merger is upon us.  The solution is a joint drafting committee to harmonize the agreements once and for all.    If enough counterparties began talking about this, it might happen.  If we, as Enron lawyers bring it up,  we are sarcastically dismissed for being cruel and unusual punishers of Mike Small.   Please think about this and factor it into your conversations with counterparties. While you are doing that, we lawyers will have the pleasure of another four to 6 hours of phone conference work as the committee toils on, the comic and absurd road show entering at least its 4th year of this debacle.   ----cgy

Subject:	Triangular setoff

The draft I sent you of the triangular setoff provision may still require significant revision. I have the following primary concerns which are not easily reconciled:

1. for an assignment to be effective it must take effect prior to bankruptcy or mutuality will be lost by the interposition of a bankruptcy trustee;

2. although words of present assignment are used,  under the current wording the assignment probably does not occur at least until there is a defaulting party;

3. if we should wish to characterize it as a general assignment for security purposes (perfection of which would require registration), there does appear to be any obligation  between X and XA (as opposed to Y) for which the assignment is to secure performance.

When you are available, I would like to speak to you regarding the foregoing.

"Re: FW: ENE/ENA Change of Ownership Diligence Inquiry","In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

"RE: B of A setoff provisions","Julia and Liz:
I reviewed the ISDA agreements with B of A, one with Enron Corp. and one with ENA.  The one with Enron Corp. does not have a ratings trigger and as we discussed, there is no financial statement rep.  The one with ENA does have a ratings trigger (below BBB- by S&P and below Baa3 by Moody's).  The ratings trigger is both an Event of Default (curable by posting collateral) and an event that lowers the collateral threshold to zero.  Setoff rights are triggerrred upon the designation of an early termination date and only extend to agreements between ENA and B of A.

According to Mary, we do not have a written agreement with B of A. Notwithstanding that, from time to time B of A sends out standard Ts and Cs regarding corporate accounts. The last one available, effective October 2001, contains a setoff provision. This purports to allow the bank a right of setoff, either before or after an event of default, and to apply both to the bank, and its affiliates. [It does not purport to apply to the debtor or any of its affiliates, except in circumstances not applicable here -- such as sole proprietor, or partnership situations.]

This is an example of the type of invoice that could possibly create issues for Newco, if Enron is an owner is some fashion.  To my knowledge, we are not paying these unless there is an Enron physical position that we are continuing pending a sale.  While Newco may or may not be responsible for Enron's debts, the fact that the other regional members will have to pick up these costs could, at the least, make a new quick membership somewhat difficult (we may ultimately be right, but they could raise a stink in the meantime).  I don't know if the bankruptcy attorneys/Newco bank attorneys have looked into this.  Let me know how we can help.

Re you voice message.
The safe harbor - section 556 -- allows a ""forward contract merchant"" to
liquidate a forward contract.  A ""forward contract merchant"" is defined as
""a person whose business consists in whole or in part of entering into
forward contracts as or with merchants in a commodity . . . ""  I would say
that an end user, or any counterparty, is as much a ""forward contract
merchant"" as Enron is since the end user has in fact entered into at least
one forward contract with Enron, and can therefore liquidate upon an Enron
bankruptcy. Let me know if you have a different view or if that does not
answer your question.

(1)  I've reconfirmed through Documentation that Wabash's termination, (stated to be effective Dec 19, 2001) was as to all wholesale power transactions between EPMI and Wabash.

(2) GPU Services has delivered a notice of termination as to all transactions with EPMI. We will be treating all wholesale power Transactions with GPU as terminated but have not had to make a final concluision as to the effective date of such termination. (They've sought to make their terminations effective Dec.21, 2001, though they had to give us a month's notice on the agrement by which EPMI sells to GPU, so that termination weffective date would be January 21, 2001.)

(3) Ameren Energy Inc. has sent us a notice of termination dated December 18, 2001, which appears to be a termination and calculation of settlement payment as to all transactions with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. -- I am trying to obtain a verification on the breaadth of this termination notice.

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise.

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)
By Mark Johnson 
Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares had dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis, said lenders extended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million note due next week. 
Enron, which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader Dynegy Inc. in a transaction now valued at more than $23 billion, said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to repay the $690 million note. The repayment would strain cash reserves Enron needs to back its trading operations, investors and analysts said. 
The Houston-based company didn't say in its release who holds the note, which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets and was backed by Enron. 
The note is held by a group of banks led by the Citibank unit of Citigroup Inc., Standard & Poor's said in a press release yesterday. 
Enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a restructuring of its debt, the company said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. 
``We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' James Lee, vice president of JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in the Enron statement. ``We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Morgan has been advising Enron on its merger with Dynegy. 
Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt due by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before the merger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before the end of the third quarter of 2002. 
Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. 
Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell $1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading. Before the announcement that it had renegotiated the $690 million note, its shares had fallen as much as 42.78 percent, the lowest level in more than a decade. 
Dynegy fell $2.50, or 6 percent, to $39.20. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 49 cents to $87.02

"GISB/EISB Workshop Nov. 9","
     Please see attached.  While I am not opposed to the formation of the
ESIB, I have several concerns based on preliminary indications that the
EISB will publish a ""standardized"" contract for wholesale power
transactions.  I'd like to avoid a third or even fourth (if you consider
ERCOT still to be a viable option) U.S. based wholesale power agreement.
As it appears that the formation of EISB is going forward, and has FERC
endorsement, it might be worthwhile to attend this workshop.  Please let me
know your thoughts.

We wanted to provide you information about this upcoming meeting, which
may be of interest to your company.  We would appreciate it if you would
pass this along to the appropriate member of your staff.

EEI will conduct a one-day workshop to focus issues and discuss options
related to the formation of the Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB).
The workshop will take place on Friday, November 9, at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.   The meeting will take
place from  8 a.m. - 4 p.m.  The purpose of the meeting is to gather EEI
member input on EISB formation issues related to both wholesale and retail
electric standards.

As you know, the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) recently expanded its
charter to include the development of electricity standards.  FERC Chairman
Pat Wood has endorsed this action, as well as Commissioner Massey and
Commissioner Brownell.  Business practice standardization issues will be
discussed this week at the FERC RTO workshops, focusing on a potential
regulatory role in defining candidates for standardized business practices.

For hotel accommodations, please contact the hotel directly at 972-453-1234
and ask for the EEI GISB-EISB special room rate of $119/night.

A meeting registration information and response form is attached.  We will
provide briefing materials to workshop participants in advance of the
meeting.

For additional information, please contact Dave Dworzak, Manager,
Transmission Policy at 202-508-5684 or at ddworzak@eei.org if you have any
questions or need more information.

Bill,

As mentioned during our conference call this morning, we have significant
Lend and Park activity with ENA (and some activity with Enron Energy
Services).  Potential stressed net exposure peaks at $ 12.4 million in April
' 02.

Due to the recent downgrades of Enron Corp.'s (Guarantor of ENA's
obligations to PG&E) senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by S&P and other
rating agencies, we respectfully request that Enron North America provide
PG&E with a Standby Irrevocable Letter of Credit in the amount of $ 6.5
million expiring no earlier than October 30, 2002.  This request is made
under the provisions of PG&E's Gas Rule 25 (Gas Services-Customer
Creditworthiness and Payment Terms).

I would appreciate your letting me know when the L/C will be issued.  Thanks

I am currently working on excising natural gas receivables from an existing gas receivable facility known as the Swee'P Receivables Facility.  This ""excisement"" is a prerequisite to our actual execution of the various Master Netting Agreements on which you are working.  In order for me to accomplish the excisement, I need to create a list of each of the non-Enron legal entities, which will be parties to the Master Netting Agreement you have been assigned.  The legal entities are needed so that we may assure that none of these legal entities will have its payables to ENA transferred to Swee'P.  The final submission of receivables is due on Monday, November 5th.  The list I am requesting from you will allow Leslie Reeves to excise your complete ""house"" from the submission of receivables.

I know that each of you are swamped, but this excisement is a prerequisite to the execution of the Master Netting Agreements.  Even if you have only a rough list of the entities in your house, please provide your best available information to me via email, copying the CCs listed on this email.  Thank you for your assistance.

Best Regards,
BNG

I would add ""dispute resolution"" to the list.  

I left off in my reading just after the Battle of Bull Run (mid-July, 1861). . .so I have a few months of catching up to do. . . but I will be reading along.  I will try to get current next weekend.

Now that Lincoln has fired Gen. McDowell, I am eager to read about the Lincoln-McClellan relationship.

Hey friends, we are rapidly approaching October, and in our communal reading of Shelby Foote, October is where things pick up and go steadily forward for three years.  Let's dust off the big tome and read forward, month by month together.  Elizabeth,  try not to read too much at a time,  just find where he is in October of 1861 and read slowly.  This is a slow, savoring thing, not a rapid read for escape and entertainment.  With this big terrorist mess going on and eveything, the lessons for both business and life are going to be termendous. And, one final admonition, Elizabeth, when you get into his lengthy descriptions of troop maneuverings,  try not to be bored,  just take a pencil and paper and kind of sketch out what you think he is saying,  the basic directions and movements...use your skills for calculating early termination payments and set offs.  All of these battles are big netting and set off messes.  You are better qualified than you think to get into this stuff.  War is just a big messy chess game termination and  set off.  Try to get your imagination into it this way.   ----cgy

There were those times, during the War, when fighters on one side of the line would gain personal knowledge of the presence of old friends, even relatives, being directly across the lines, back there in the mass of enemey troops.  The Union General Hancock had been a very close friend of the Confederate General Armsted and on the eve of the final day at Gettysburg,  had a moment or two remembering their good old days together in California.  Wolfe and Krebs are out there somewhere ""on the other side.""  Although I must candidly confess that officer Krebs does not rank high in my humble judgement and is not among the significant players in the combat,  Wolfe does.  Wolfe was a player.  He is out there somewhere on the otherside, talking to ""them"" and not to ""us"" at night, and this causes me the pain of sorely missing a guy I spent many an hour beside in the trenches.  I miss Greg.  I hope I don't have to go head to head with him,  but, if duty calls.....----cgy

I hear that former Enron marketers Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs will be joining AEP.  AEP does not yet have an office in Portland, but Greg is working out of his house.  Holli has not yet started work because her non-compete agreement is still in force.

Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP) continues to make changes to its Credit 
Policy to reflect changes in overall market conditions. The current Credit 
Policy was posted on our web site on November 14, 2001. It reflects a marked 
shift in the way SPP has administered its Credit Policy in the past. 

SPP wants all of our customers to be made aware of this change and we want 
to give each  a certain period of time to make the necessary adjustments in 
any areas that may be necessary. To this end SPP is attaching the new Credit 
Policy for your review. We ask that it be directed to the proper person 
within your organization to assure that your company is compliant with all 
conditions of the Credit Policy. We ask that you also complete the attached 
Credit Agreement and return it to SPP as soon as possible. 

SPP expects all customers to be compliant with the Credit Policy by December 
15, 2001. Please review the Credit Policy and take the necessary steps to be 
in compliance by that date so that there are no interruptions of service or 
your ability to make future reservations. 

If you have any questions concerning the new policy please feel free to 
contact me.  I look forward to working with you to make these changes as 
smooth as possible.

"Enron Legal Edge Signon Changes","Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.

Forward Email to Administrative Staff
Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you.

Contact Us
If you would like to provide feedback for the Single Sign-On effort, send an email to sso@enron.com. If you have issues or concerns regarding this change, please contact the Resolution Center at ext. 3-1411.


Regards,
The Legal Edge and Single Signon Teams

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

He is out there somewhere on the otherside, talking to ""them"" and not to ""us"" at night, and this causes me the pain of sorely missing a guy I spent many an hour beside in the trenches.  I miss Greg.  I hope I don't have to go head to head with him,  but, if duty calls.....----cgy

I hear that former Enron marketers Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs will be joining AEP.  AEP does not yet have an office in Portland, but Greg is working out of his house.  Holli has not yet started work because her non-compete agreement is still in force.

"RE: TCA question","This language looks fine to me, but ELIZABETH is the structure ok with you? (The participating transmission owners (PTO) will be getting paid their revenue requirements by the RTO, so I think the RTO and the PTOs having a lock box is fine.

Christi and Susan,

Below is a message that I had sent to Steve Walton earlier this morning asking for his assessment of a section of the Acme (DSTAR) TCA.  Can you tell me if the text below is standard practice or is it more than favorable to the PTO?

Thanks,

Are you familar with any fund(s) management in the context of RTO West or other such entity.  Below is some of the language in the ""Acme"" aka DSTAR TCA, I am not expereinced in this at all, but some of this looks suspect to me (Too may PTO rights).  Any comments you have would be helpful.

"EPMI/EES draft ICAP paper","Attached is the second draft of Enron's comments to FERC on ICAP.  The structure of the paper is summarised below:

1.  RTO's are a positive step forward for the industry.
2.  Spot markets are a necessary part of RTO development to ensure that the RTO can manage real time realiability.
3.  A well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as ICAP, reserve margin (i.e. it achieves the objectives of iCap).  The paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion.
4.  During the transition from a regulated environment to RTO's there may be a 'political' need for ICAP.  Specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to 2 years after RTO implementation.
5.  If that is the case, the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for ICAP.
6.  Proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms.  

We would appreciate input on two issues.

Firstly, Enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets (i.e. don't suggest an interim solution).  While this is attractive, it is unlikely that Enron will get support from other participants (ICAP payments subsidize generation investment so no support from IPP's and consumers are not as confident as Enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain ICAP).

Secondly, drafting comments on the paper generally.  Please note that the final section, that proposes the Enron solution, requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution.

A final draft will be sent out on the morning of Tuesday 10/16, the paper will be filed Wednesday.

regards
Mike ext. 57634

PS.  i don't want to sway opinion but i thought it may be useful to state my view.  I think that we concentrate on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  Instead of proposing specific ICAP related solutions, we state that if others have different views, these should be debated in a specific FERC forum and any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions....

"NRG Dispute","On Thursday afternoon, I received from NRG all of the transcripts of communications that they  recorded between the parties.  Here is my short summary:
 
There are six transcripts.  Five of them seem pretty good for us.  One is truly awful.
 
Transcript 1 (May 4, 2001):   NRG's Bill Stone talks to John Zurita about trying to come to terms on the deal.  No terms are finalized.
 
Transcript 2 (May 4, 2001):  Stone calls Zurita back and proposes a price that Zurita agrees to.  However, Zurita makes it clear that although many of the terms have been agreed to, ""obviously we have to get agreements signed and get the lawyers involved and all that good stuff.""  Stone appears to recognize that the deal is not complete:  ""So we're really not done.  Fuck.""
 
Transcript 3 (May 8, 2001):  Stone simply leave a voicemail for Chuck Decker asking to get a confirm of the deal.
 
Transcript 4 (May 8, 2001):  Stone talks to Decker.  Decker says: ""Rogers Herndon is in charge of that. Okay?  He has to put the pressure on the credit guys to get the credit shit put to bed.  His words, and they're not exact, but they're pretty close to this, I consider the deal done, tell Bill the deal is done, assuming that the back offices communicate the needed information.""  Discussions are had about getting the credit folks together to iron out details.
 
Transcript 5 (May 16, 2001) (THE BAD TAPE):  Stone calls Zurita and sets him up, asking him a number of questions aimed at determining if there really is a binding and enforceable deal between the parties.  When Stone asks ""why don't you just tell me where you guys think the deal is?,"" Zurita replies:  ""I think -- I say the deal is done.""  Stone's next question:  ""Well, let me ask a question.  What happens if gas goes to two bucks tomorrow?  Do you still consider the deal done?""  Zurita's answer:  ""Yep.""  And there's more.  Stone next asks: ""Are you guys going to stand on the deal for $70 for the five years?  I mean, I just -- I mean, I just gotta know exactly where you stand.""  Zurita's answer:  ""The deal is done, yes.""  Ouch.  This is not good.
 
Transcript 6 (May 18, 2001):  Zurita calls Stone.  They discuss credit terms.  Stone makes several comments that indicate he realizes the deal is not done. (""The only thing, the only thing I care about is how long it's going to take to have the agreement worked out""); (""What is my concern is how far away are theyfrom getting done?"").
 
Rogers, I am interested in your views after you have had an opportunity to review the tapes.  Let's talk soon.  For you others, please let me know if you want transcripts of the tapes.  
 
Andy
 
P.S. --  Under the agreement we reached with NRG for exchange of the tapes, we must trade position papers with NRG on October 25, 2001.  I will prepare the position paper later this week.

Colored text identifies the changes from that delivery point text format which was resolved for the ERCOT 2001 zones.

For your convenience of reference, also attached below is the map of the four zones provided by ERCOT.

Doug will come back to you directly if he wants to indicate a date after which these Zonal products should not be tradable on EOL (I presume such date, if installed, would be either Oct 31, 2002 or Dec. 31, 2002).

Subject:	ERCOT Update


The ERCOT Board approved the congestion zones for next year, 2001. The ERCOT Board accepted the 3 CSC 4 CM Zone model for use in commercial congestion management for 2002.  Effective date is January 1, 2002.  The three CSC's are Graham-Parker 345 kV DCKT, Sandow-Temple 345 kV DCKT and STP-DOW 345 kV DCKT.  The four CM Zones are West02, North02, South02 and Houston02.  A power point presentation along with a map is available at ftp://ftp.ercot.com/CSCDATA/csc.htm.  

Current Congestion Cost and Outlook.  The congestion charges that have been incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge. If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upon the ERCOT protocols. The actual cost to redispatch and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM. Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation. 
When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model. This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge. The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned. The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit.  I will attach a copy of the current draft of the TCR white paper.  In short, the TCR is a financial option that can be purchased as hedge against zonal congestion.  There is no physical requirement for the TCR in that you do not have to physically schedule to receive the benefit of the TCR.  There will be an auction on or about the 4th of February, 2002 and the full zonal implementation will take place February 15, 2002.  The tentative schedule is as follows:
?	10/5/01 - Distribute draft TCR White Paper
?	10/22/01 - Review and edit draft TCR White Paper
?	10/30/01 - Distribute TCR White Paper to WMS
?	11/1/01 - WMS Meeting; vote on PRR
?	11/8/01 - TAC Meeting
?	11/19/01 - Board Meeting
?	12/4/01 - ERCOT issues notice of TCR Auction
?	2/15/02 - First effective date of TCRs and direct assignment of CSC Congestion Costs
 << File: TCR_whitepaper_rev04.1.doc >> 
Capacity Auction.  The capacity auction workshops have begun to rework that capacity rule and problems experienced with the last round.  There was an initial discussion on the problems that were experienced with credit and how the standard was one-way and the buyers of capacity were left without recourse.  There was a subsequent conference call with the credit professionals to discuss the issues ( I did not participate) and there will be an additional meeting on the 19th.  The purpose of the short-term meeting are to rectify issues such as credit and documents prior to the March and July 2002 auctions.  Substantive issues such as the actual products, zone determination and the auction process will be part of a rulemaking prior to the September 2002 auction which includes annual products. 

Protocol Implementation.  ERCOT is in the process of determining what should be included in the Phase II design which will begin January 2001.  There is a priority list that is currently under review by ERCOT vendors to determine lead times of Phase II items in an attempt to deliver Phase II items ASAP.  Parviz Adib from MOD stressed that there are certain issues that the PUCT expects to be addressed in Phase II.  Issues that do not require major system changes might still be doable in Phase II if the PRR Process is started immediately.  There is a placeholder in the Protocols related to BULs and loads acting as resources.

Mechanism for Simultaneous Procurement of Ancillary Services.   The PUCT has expressed concern that there could be price reversals associated with the ancillary services market (if it is assumed that the various ancillary services have different levels of value to the market).  The Board had approved a contingency plan to allow price modifications in the early markets, however the plan has not been implemented.  The WMS discussed, at length, the issue of simultaneously clearing all three markets - non-spinning, regulation, and responsive reserve.  A task force was formed to initially identify the principles for developing a mechanism for simultaneous procurement of ancillary services issue.  It was suggested that a consultant be hired to develop Protocol language once the principles are identified.  The first task force meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled.  

Demand-Side Task Force.  Jay Zarnikau reported on activities of the Demand-Side Task Force that is addressing Balancing Up Load (BUL) Market Issues and other demand-side issues.  The PUCT expects the full functionality to be in place on January 1, 2002.  The DSTF met last on October 1st (third meeting).  The DSTF completed a draft status report on Demand-Side Resources and Demand Responsiveness.  It was noted that the work of the DSTF is not complete and has not been approved by any ERCOT Committee or the Board.  However, ERCOT was required to file a report on these issues in the STF Report.  The report reviews the policy considerations that have prompted interest in the demand side of ERCOT's market, reviews the PUCT's directive, reviews the role of demand-side resources in ERCOT's markets, and identifies the issues and impediments that the DSTF is presently addressing.  It also summarizes the options discussed by the DSTF to date.  The PUCT staff has suggested that ERCOT hire a consultant, such as Eric Hirsch, to provide more resources for this effort.  The group expects to wrap up BUL issues and address direct load control issues at its next meeting.

Unit Specific Deployments.  At the next WMS meeting October 24, 2001, there will be a discussion regarding unit specific deployments and ERCOT will discuss the issues and the difficult that participants are having to meet the ramp rates of the deployments.  The WMS will develop a list of issues and case studies for ERCOT to discuss.  The WMS also briefly discussed PRR 282 related to defining OOME as an Instructed Deviation.

"RE: Witch hunt","There is a direct analogy to the Civil War here.  Soon after the Union began to lose with much embarrassment in the field, a Committee For Overseeing the Conduct of the War comprised of big angry guys from Congress was formed, I'm not sure how.  I think they just kind of announced that they were formed.  They began interviewing people and were quite viscious about their conclusions, if I recall correctly, they gave themselves the power to jail people. Lincoln endured them and eventually they atrophied, but this kind of  savage second guessing and vigilante  vengance by elected legislators is definitely a theme of politics.  The notion that Dunn is seeking to keep things quiet to prevent rumors is total bullshit.  If I were one of those poor saps being interviewed, I would get a lawyer and scream bloody murder about due process.  Dunn can only do harm with this tactic, and again, it shows that the pathology of the body politic in Californicatia has advanced to its most florid degree.  These people are sick.  ----cgy

California state senator Joe Dunn is conducting a secret McCarthyesque inquisition of ISO Board members in an apparent effort to find a scapegoat to soak up the political blame for the energy crisis and divert negative criticism from Davis.  Dunn better pick up the pace, the March primary election is only a few months away.

Energy probe kept under wraps: In secret, a Capitol panel is deposing key players in the lifting of a power price cap.
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Oct. 30, 2001) 
A legislative committee is taking secret depositions of energy officials in a highly unusual effort to shed light on events that some believe triggered California's energy crisis almost a year ago. 
The depositions, whose format was spelled out in a Senate resolution in July, represent a first for any state Legislature in the United States, according to Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. Dunn, a lawyer who chairs the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market, is taking most of the depositions. 
Dunn said the secrecy is meant to prevent unfounded rumors from becoming public. 
""We're trying to do this investigation in a thorough and professional fashion,"" he said. ""I'm not interested in tarnishing anybody or any company with information that doesn't turn out to be true."" 
But some think the secrecy is unwarranted and makes the testimony prone to manipulation. 
""My concern is that if we have secret depositions and the committee starts issuing reports, the full context of what was said or talked about does not come to true light,"" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association representing independent energy facilities and power marketers. Smutny-Jones, the former board chairman of the state's electrical grid operator, is scheduled to testify in early November. 
Sen. Ray Haynes, R-Riverside, voted against the July resolution that laid the groundwork for the depositions and still has misgivings about the process. 
""Whenever you have politicians doing an investigation like that, there's a risk that the investigation turns into a circus, especially when it's done in secret,"" Haynes said. 
Secrecy could allow people to ""play hide and seek"" with the testimony, he said, releasing only those parts that support one theory. It could also allow the witnesses to attack the committee's findings by arguing that the whole story wasn't told. 
""Over time, it hurts them,"" Haynes said. 
All 16 subpoenas issued by Dunn's committee went to current or former board members or staff of the Independent System Operator. 
If those called on to give testimony want it public, Dunn said, he would grant the request. So far, no one has asked. 
What some energy officials really want, Dunn said, is access to other depositions. 
""We're not going to give folks the opportunity to compare stories,"" he said. ""There's no reason they need to see what other people said."" 
The grid operator would prefer the testimony to be open, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. As of Monday, Dunn had not informed the Independent System Operator officials that they can choose to make their testimony public, she said. 
""We think it would be a great opportunity to explain some of the complex issues"" the grid operator faced last December, McCorkle said. 
The committee is focusing on events in early December 2000, when Terry Winter, president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operator, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to lift a price cap on power. The cap of $250 per megawatt-hour was replaced with a ""soft cap,"" in which power sellers could charge more as long as they justified the higher costs. 
Winter and other managers at the grid operator had a good relationship with the board and were in the habit of consulting with it, Dunn said. 
But on Dec. 8, Winter submitted the emergency filing without letting the board know. 
""The ISO board was shocked at that filing,"" Dunn said. 
In response to Winter's request, the normally slow-moving FERC issued an order within an hour and a half. The series of events ""caused a lot of people to be very suspicious of what led up to that filing,"" Dunn said. 
The committee is investigating whether Winter and electrical generators engaged in a concerted effort to bring about the lifting of the price cap. It has subpoenaed documents, personal calendars, e-mails and phone records. Three or four depositions have been done, with the rest scheduled in the next three weeks. 
Some energy officials say that the theory being investigated by the Dunn committee is fatally flawed. 
""If that's where it's directed, I don't think it's going anywhere,"" Smutny-Jones said. ""Terry was empowered to take action independently, which he did do and it kept the lights on. I'm very troubled at someone trying to turn Terry Winter into a scapegoat."" 
The ISO board at the time was ""close to totally dysfunctional,"" Smutny-Jones said, making it reasonable for Winter to act alone. Winter's filing, and the FERC response, are all well-documented. 
""There was no conspiracy, no smoking guns there,"" he said. 
The FERC order, in fact, kept electricity flowing into the state and allowed the grid operator to seek refunds later, McCorkle said. 
Before the order, ""there were literally no bids in our real-time market,"" she said. 
But Dunn said the FERC had other options, such as ordering generators to sell into the California market. 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said ISO officials failed to notify the governor of the emergency filing, despite the fact they met with him on other matters that day. 
""They clearly didn't want the governor to know,"" Maviglio said. 
The Senate resolution says that no one can be present for the depositions except members and staff of Dunn's committee, the person taking the deposition, an official reporter, the person being deposed and his or her counsel. Many of the ISO officials have retained private attorneys, whose bills will be paid by the grid operator, as required by the nonprofit corporation's by-laws. 
The California Constitution allows closed sessions of the Legislature and its committees only in certain cases, such as party caucuses or to discuss pending litigation. 
But Terry Francke, general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said open meeting provisions likely would not apply to depositions where less than a quorum of the committee was present. 
Dunn said only he and committee staffers have been present in the depositions taken thus far.

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

On the VEPCO contract we also need to consider the damages for failure to deliver scheduled energy.  Yesterday we talked about normal LDs.  This likely will not work if we are basing the VEPCO price on an hourly index since VEPCO's cost of cover would likely be close to hourly prices.

 Under the current contract, if we fail to deliver, EPMI is obligated to pay:

1.  Cost of Cover defined as either (a) (1) actual cost of incremental purchase or generation costs or if VEPCO is unable to make up the delivery obligations, then (2) VEPCO's highest cost source of generation minus (b) offered energy price (hourly index price under new proposal) Section 9.2); plus either

(A)  If VEPCO has designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of annual capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $530,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) (Section 9.3); or 

(B) If VEPCO has not designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of daily capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $42,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) Section 9.5); 

Let's think about what we should propose (eg 150% of index hourly price per hour of non-delivery?)

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP"" (the ""Index""). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

"RE: Faith-based contracting",">What do you think is the next best step?  

The next step is to gather up a few players who share this view and go to Mike as a non-Enron proposal and try it that way.  I am going to give the idea a test drive with perhaps the most provocative and difficult and potentially significant player in the drama, Brenda Anderson of BPA.  The Queen of Bonneville Trading sits over there across the river and survives on sheer guts and effrontery.  I am going to saddle my horse, attach a white kerchief to my saber and ride over behind the lines for a secret caucus.  This is the stuff of real diplomacy that could be fruitful.  

Meanwhile, to hell with San Diego.  Something will happen and it won't matter so we should focus on the big picture and let the ants gather there and scramble among the crumbs. ----cgy

Subject:	RE: Faith-based contracting

HI 

So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  

ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.

Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.

Subject:	Faith-based contracting

I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours.  Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs, munis, and federal PMA's I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract, it's almost a religion.  One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran.

Whether it's assimilation or merger, or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education, we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract.  Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract.---""Why should I change, the agreements are virtually identical?""

Elizabeth, 

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories. 

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.   

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements. 

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions. 

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.   

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result. 
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.   ----cgy

Our November troop meeting will be November 6th at  St. Luke's Blanton Building.  The meeting starts at 3:30 and ends at  5pm.  Parents who signed up to help at the meeting are Melanie Morgan and  MK Cooper.  
 
Just a few reminders:
1.  Remember to bring your assigned item for  our Troop First Aid Box.
2.  If you've been called to turn in lingering  paperwork, please bring it to the meeting.
3.  We try to end our meeting with a song or a  closing ceremony.  Please limit discussions in the area and siblings  running around as the girls are very easily distracted.
 
We are going to be decorating T-shirts at the  meeting. (Moms who are helping, please wear old  clothes!) 
Also we will be showing the girls the different  events they will be eligible to enter at STRIDERS.  STRIDERS is a Girl  Scout track and field day.  This year's event will be held on December 1st  from noon to about 5pm.  Paperwork will be coming home with the girls and  will need to be returned very quickly.  Please watch for it!

<p><SPAN class=text2>As Turning Leaf wines are handcrafted for perfection, a majority of the grapes for Turning Leaf were selected from some of the finest vineyards in the Lodi region. A major winegrape-growing region since the 1850s, Lodi is increasingly looked to by leading California wineries for grapes of superior quality. The warm days and cool nights of its Mediterranean climate allow the grapes to develop excellent color and maintain crisp acid levels through to harvest. The end result is a well-balanced fruit-forward Chardonnay with excellent varietal character.</P></span>

If you are driving to the meeting, please park in the spaces in front of the
building and the building opposite our building (near the traffic circle on
the west side of our building) that are labeled as guest parking for 2800
Eisenhower Avenue.  You will need to get a guest parking pass from the guard
at the front desk.  If the guard is not there, please let me or the

An agenda for the Nov. 12 Meeting.  It looks like dinner won't happen, but
Ed said he'd buy drinks Monday night.

One benefit would be customer satisfaction.  We will need all the counterparties we can get when the trading floor re-opens.

The customer wants to do it because (right or wrong) he thinks it gives the bankruptcy time to ""run its course.""

We need to be able to demonstrate some measurable benefit to Enron in doing this.  Since we are not making any post-bankruptcy settlement payments, pushing the payment date back is not enough.  What other benefit would there be?  Why again does the customer want to do this?

Carol, in regards to our discussion yesterday evening.  I have a customer who wants to roll some of his hedges back a few months.  We are ""out of the money"" on the hedges.  The roll will be done where it does not change our liability.  This is better for ENE because it pushes our liabilities due out into the future by about six months.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks for your help.

A  friend is giving a seminar next week if anyone is interested in going.   
 
 
 
 
With the uncertainty in financial markets and  changes taking place in everything from the way we do business to  how we think about our lives, this seminar will address how to plan our  financial futures from where to invest now to planning techniques in  investments and estate planning.
 
Having navigated client investments through  previous wars and shocks to the economy, I will discuss the state of the economy  and asset allocation techniques for your investments in this precarious  time.  Other topics discussed :  retirement planning under the new tax  act and determining your risk tolerance.
 
I look forward to seeing you at this informative  seminar.  Feel free to bring interested parties.

"Burr Oak Veneer...","From: Mark Whitney
TheLaw.net Corporation
Homepage: http://www.thelaw.net
Remove: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     The Bentley Arnage Red Label is a beautiful four sedan, but it's not for everyone.
http://www.bentleymotors.co.uk/bentley/picture_gallery/bentley_2.jpg
True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut, burr oak, bird's eye maple or black lacquer veneer, most would still find the $200K+ sticker price out of reach. Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition. After all, burr oak veneer is still veneer.


WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH?

     Lawyers from coast-to-coast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control. Many, given their firm size, practice area or jurisdiction, simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis. Others have concluded, as one guesses they might with the Bentley, that after peeling back the veneer, these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth.


THEORY vs. REALITY

     As nice as it might be to own a Bentley, it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school, just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access, only to yank the needle upon graduation.

     What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw? Perhaps more to the point, what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands? Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues?

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary jurisdiction packages and thumbs its nose at the reality that you practice in a state like Vermont, for example, a jurisdiction that only issues about 100 new published opinions ANNUALLY, and not surprisingly has yet to consider anything remotely resembling your client's situation?

WHAT ABOUT WEST AND LEXIS?

     Pay them only when you have to. Will you still use Lexis or West from time to time? Sure. Probably. But perhaps you will get to the point where you use them on the web with your credit card, when you can't otherwise get the answer faster, cheaper elsewhere. Or maybe you like that West or Lexis Primary Jurisdiction Plan that you've been using all these years and you think TheLaw.net can provide a sort of meter insurance for those occasions where the circumstances call for a national look.

"Interesting item on eBay web site item#1018324337: Cannondale Criterium R300 Road Bike","I saw this item for sale at eBay, the world's largest personal trading community, and thought that you might be interested. Vaa.  Oy Yoy.

Title of item:	Cannondale Criterium R300 Road Bike
Seller:	votefreedom1st

Ends:	Oct-20-01 17:20:23 PDT

Item Description:
	53cm (21 in) Cannondale Criterium Road/Racing Bike

You are bidding on an aluminum frame Cannondale Criterium, Model 8R300, 53cm bicycle.
I am the original and only owner of this bike. This bike is white with blue lettering. The components are the original Suntour Accushift alpha-3040 group. Also included are: Time criterium pedals with shoe cleats, a Profile Aerobar, a Cateye Vectra CC-7000 computer
(needs battery), Mistral rims, a Vetta saddle, and Diacompe brakes. I am also including a Zefel hp
X3 pump that fits nicely beneath the top tube, which is not shown. The small blue saddle bag shown in the photo is the only accessory not included.

This bike has been hanging in my garage by the stem and saddle (not by the rims) for the last few
years. The tires have gone down, but will hold air for a few days. It does have a few paint chips on the front fork (see photo) and there is surface rust in these chips, on the rear freewheel, and on
the chain.

With a good cleaning, good lube, and new rubber this will be an awesome bike at a great price. Don't miss this great chance to get atop Cannondale Craftsmanship.

Shipping: I will take to this bike to a bicycle shop in the 37127 or 37064 area for packaging and shipping. Winning bidder will pay the final bid plus actual packaging and shipping costs.
I estimate about $50 total S&H. Call your local bike shop, or call a bike shop in the zipcode areas listed to get an estimate.

Payment: If you want to use a credit card for payment you can click on the Bidpay icon below to order a
Bidpay money order. I will also accept payment by check (must clear my credit union) or US money
order (ships upon receipt).

Other: I reserve the right to cancel this auction as this bike is also for sale locally.

Good Luck and thank for looking!

Please find the analysis for Ontario.  I would like to highlight Guillermo's conclusion.  To quote ""As a BBB rated company, Enron should have been provided an allowable reduction in prudential support of $5 million.  According to the market rules (section 5.8.2), the announcement of being placed on ""credit watch"" would result in Enron being automatically downgraded to below BBB, which means that Enron no longer qualifies for an allowable reduction. Enron would need to replace the $5 million with additional prudential support within five business days.""  

Please let me know if you have any question.

"RE: NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security","

I received the margin letter this morning via Fax.  However, it is backdated to Nov 19th for my phone call with Richard Ott at NIMO.  We have 5 days to deliver (some flexibility to view it as 5 business days).  The margin call is for $4,283,512.  It is to cover NIMO for settlement and imbalance risk for EES participation in their ""Supplier Select"" program.

Subject:	NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security

	Molly:

	Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's ""Supplier Select"" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted ""as financial evaluations dictate"". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as ""BBB"" from S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii) the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2.  

	In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an ""A"" bond rating; (iii) a security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least ""BBB"" by S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

	Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional information.

	MLC

"RE: Adequate Assurance Letters for Tonight","Tom/Bill

Attached hereto, is the response letter to Duke Energy Merchants, LLC relating to their demand for adequate assurances of performance from ELFI, EGLI, ECT and ENA.

I have copied Elizabeth Sager on this e-mail, as there may be a similar letter that has been sent to EPMI, though I have not seen a copy of this letter.  In the event that there is such a request outstanding the entity may be added to the letter already prepared.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Please note that the ""bcc"" list should not be sent with the final copy of the letter to Duke.

"Summary of LC Issues","Here is where I understand things stand based on our discussions this morning:

1.	Vitol SA - Tom Moran sent an e-mail to Mark Leskowitz asking if Vitol has paid Enron.  I have not heard from Mark or Tom.  The LC expires on 12/28.

2.	El Paso - I just sent an e-mail summarizing the netting situation.  If the netting was proper then our only grounds for drawing is failure to renew the LC.  We sent them a letter yesterday about this.  Credit was going to contact them.  We can draw as early as next Wednesday.

3.	Great Bay - same as El Paso absent the netting issue.

4.	LG&E Energy Marketing - they owe us  a payment next Wednesday.  We will wait to see if they have paid and if they haven't we can declare them in default and draw.  If they have, we can draw based on a failure to renew the LC.


5.	Enserco - I will draft for Monica a follow up letter to send to them.  Credit will begin calculating Exposure/termination Amounts in anticipation of a termination as of Thursday, December 27th.  The letter today will give them until Wednesday to renew.

6.	Niagra Mohawk/ENA, Metromedia energy/ENA, Simpson Tacoma/ENA, The Energy Authority/ENA, Energy Production/ENA, Rising Star Energy LLC/ENA - I am waiting on payment history info from Leslie to see if we have any right to draw.   Could someone in credit confirm that we are in-the-money on all of these?

7.	City of Santa Clara - Harlan to send out default notice.

Ontario's open power market: How the key players are players are positioning themselves 
  
(Our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this message. Several lists were combined to ensure complete coverage) 
  
Ontario's power market is set to open to competition by May of 2002.

Take advantage of this exceptional lineup of experts to fully compare your options before the best opportunities are spoken for: 
Hear the top business leaders and decision-makers in the electricity business explain their latest plans and reasoning for engaging themselves in the Ontario electricity market: 
Ontario's Minister of Finance and Deputy Premier Jim Flaherty 
TransAlta's CEO Steve Snyder 
Ontario's Minister of Energy Jim Wilson 
Chair of Bruce Power, Robin Jeffrey 
The CEO of Toronto Hydro, Courtney Pratt 
Ontario's Minister of Environment, Elizabeth Witmer 
Senior authorities from the grid operators in Pennsylvania, California and Ontario

"Draft script for getting broker quotes","Elizabeth,

Here is a quick draft at a script to get some broker quotes.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to get firm quotes because our counterparties will not give them to us.  As a consequence, we will only be able to get indicative quotes from brokers.  I am assuming that you are preoccupied with other pressing matters; If I don't hear from you by tomorrow on this, I will distribute this to the term traders, and then we can improve the script later.---sch


Hi,

I'm calling you back to go over the spreadsheet you sent me.  I need to make a record of this.  Could you please spell your name for me and give me your phone number?  And you work at ________?  Great.

I sent you a spreadsheet showing different delivery points and durations for the delivery of power.  Is that right?  

And I asked you to provide indicative market prices for these products?  Is that right?

Were you able to provide some indicative prices?

How did you get those prices?  

Do you believe that these prices accurately and substantially represent market prices at which counterparties would buy and sell power today, November ____, 2001?

Great.  Thank you.

"HYDA Index -2","
Monday   -2

The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Tuesday, November 20 is  -2.

The bad news contained in the 10Q did not lead to an immediate junk bond downgrade.  This implies that Mr. Banker,  who lent us the  $9b that, (surprise!),  we have to pay back so soon,  has been able to persuade Mr. Credit Rater to stay his release of the raised guillotine a day longer, permitting us, we hope, to withdraw our neck from the block and continue to negotiate with Mr. Banker for the vintage Enron ""blend and extend"" package. 

Amidst much crow activity up and down the river, a single large specie was seen flying due north with a large tuft of something clasped in his beak,  followed by a rapacious sea gull in hot pursuit.

"East Power Positions","Please see the attached spreadsheet for the estimated value to be received for delivering power in the East for the period 12/27 through 12/31 (we will be working on the post 12/31 periods this week).  In summary, the total is approx. is $2.7MM net.  The total cost of power is approx. $15.3MM.  It is broken down $4.5MM for PJM, $5.5MM for NEPOOL, and $5.3MM for Others (not including Ameren and Wabash) outside PJM and NEPOOL.  We are working separate arrangements for NEPOOL and PJM, having wired NEPOOL in excess of $8MM on Friday to prepay for power in an effort to be able to do business in that pool through 12/26.  We are working with PJM, and should have resolution by the 27th (they have $31MM of our pre-bankruptcy cash in escrow).  

Outside of PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin is going to go into the bilateral market and prepay for power (similar to what we are doing in the West).  As such, Kevin will need approximately $5.5MM  to prepay for power in the East through 12/31 (Ameren and Wabash are negative today through the 31st, but will turn positive after the first of the year - Kevin will not be serving these until after the first of the year).  The value outside of NEPOOL and PJM is a little over $700M.  Kevin has a number of customers that are in NEPOOL and /or PJM , as well as other regions and you need to serve in all regions to get the full value from the contract.

Having spoken with Tim DeSpain this morning, it appears Ray and Tim are on board for this course of action given that it is consistent with our mandate to preserve the value of the estate (and entering into these positions is ancillary to winding down the existing positions, and not some new speculative trade).

As such, Leslie and her team should expect to begin receiving the wiring instructions early Wednesday morning for Kevin's prepayment deals.

Kevin, I will work with you to explain the form of request that we have been using in the West.

RISKS:
HEDGING: As this juncture, our ability to hedge longer term is limited (requires significant cash - we need to do cost/benefit analysis).  We are therefore limited to daily spot transactions in PJM and NEPOOL.  Outside PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin may have limited ability to buy forward for a few days. We recognize this risk, and the next step in the analysis is to determine at what cost (prepay) can we hedge some of these contracts and if we can, should we. Regardless, it is generally believed that when we begin to serve some of these counterparties, they will terminate the contracts, which will crystallize the in-the-money-value of the contract.

OFFSET RIGHTS: We are still working through all the positions in Enron to determine which parties have master netting agreements that would allow someone to offset one position with another.  A quick review of the open East Power positions indicates this risk should be limited.  Additionally, we are still working through net payable/receivable issues and therefore we may owe some of these counterparties money which they may try to offset with the delivered power.  We are working through these issues, and again it is generally believed that the potential returns outweigh the risk, and that there is a high probability that some of these counterparties will terminate the contracts and crystallize the in-the-money-value to us.  

Please call me at 713-412-8967 (cell) or 713-529-6280 (home) if anyone has any questions.  Otherwise, Kevin and his team will begin to purchase power in the non PJM/NEPOOL markets on Wednesday, and will continue to serve the customers in PJM and NEPOOL, subject to resolving the open issues in those regions.

"Follow-up on VEPCO","Elizabeth,

Hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving-weekend.  Just wanted to follow-up on my messages on your voice mail re. our call with VEPCO and subsequently, with Kevin.  It seems that there might be some agreement with VEPCO with regards to moving to an hourly index.  Kevin said he needed to hear from you and the higher-ups that our potential exposure resulting from audits was something we needed to address, and he would then take the resulting positions on his books (without being penalized over potential MTM downside).

Please give me a call when you have a moment so I can fill you in, and we can discuss the feedback we need to provide internally and to VEPCO (they're expecting something by tomorrow - Tuesday, 11/27/01)

Please feel free to call me at any time.

Regards,
Rahil

"HYDA  -5","
The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Thursday, November 8, 2001:   -5

Monday       +1
Tuesday       -1
Wednesday -2
Thursday     -5


The pronounced slow down in trading and the release of the restatement of income figures, amounting as the numbers did,  to another heavy ""foot falling,""  are substantive factors that are not mitigated by the fact that the Street stayed its raised boot from punting us across the junk bond  line and that the Dynagy merger talks apparently continue, while the Mordant news further darkens the perception of the inner sanctum of the commercial temple.  

 What does it mean that as our inexorable fall continues step by step,  the crows, those sable messengers that were flying up and down this very river at this very site when Rome fell, are showing increasingly positive signs?  Today, several couples danced with what could only be seen as playfulness on the upcurrents of warm air that abound in and around the buildings,  gamboling aviary dyads  in the bright sun above the scarlet leaves, their dance upon the wind currents clearly celebratory, even to our reluctant, jaded eyes, sickened with foul corruption.    ----cgy

"Energy Marketing Services Deal Templates, and credit annex","As discussed with Tom today, and a while ago with Ed, I'm forwarding for your review and comment the current state of development of several Energy Marketing Service Agreement templates.  These are all prepared solely as to the marketing of power, and do not cover provision of fuel or performing any origination work for Customers.  The templates attached are: (1) the hourly/day-ahead template (or ""extreme short form EMSA""), unchanged from what was circulated 9-7-01 for comment, (2) an EMSA for use with a Customer owning a generator (similar to Mobile, SPSA situation), (3) an EMSA template for use with a Customer owning a mix of purchased power (under ""PPAs"") and generation, (together referenced as ""Resources""), and (4) a credit support annex, for use when appropriate with the forms referenced as items 2 and 3.  Please pay particular attention to the draft Exhibit A to the item 2 & 3 templates, where the manner in which services will be compensated remains to be worked out.  Redlining in the ""PPA & Gen"" EMSA template (Item 3) mostly indicates changes from the ""Gen only"" template (Item 2).   Please come back to me with questions, comments, or redlines of any changes you may want to suggest.  --David

Subject:	RE: CalPX Collateral Issue

This is a quick note to let the team know that I do have the credit worthiness requirements for PX (FERC Electric Service Tariff, Art. 2.4); a summary could be prepared if needed.   I trust that the Team would benefit from a legal opinion on Art. 2.4.5, and the associated schedule 2 of the tariff  related to ""Changes in the Amount of Security Provided by a PX Participant""  which allows a refund of securities above the PX security Amount.  As Steve mentioned nicely below, if the security amount is zero, then perhaps there is an argument for a full refund.

On the same theme, I am investigating  the requirements for maintaining ESP (electricity service provider) in California.  One of the conditions is that the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO.  If the CA ISO also necessitates participant status in the PX for  some transactions, then there is a circular flow in the argument, and may be there is a need to maintain a form of relationship with the PX.

I shall keep you posted with progress.

Subject:	CalPX Collateral Issue

Thanks Steve.  With your input, my take on Elizabeth's questions are:

1.	Must we renew the collateral?-  From a legal standpoint the answer is ""No"" for the reasons discussed below.  However, as we know, the PX will take a contrary position and has (along with other California parties) taken the position at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of the CA refund case at FERC (to secure payment of refunds due).

2.	May we replace the letters of credit with cash / other collateral?-  The answer is ""Yes"" as you note below, with the caveat that the replacement collateral must be acceptable to the PX.  Obviously cash should be acceptable.  Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option.

3.	What is the potential outcome if we do nothing (i.e. we don't re-up the letters of credit).  Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration.

As for additional options, we could consider:

1. 	Further to Steve's option 1, we might try to enforce the return of the excess in court by submitting a Section 2.5 request to the PX and bringing the issue to a head.  Steve's original option is preferable, however, since it is through agreement with the PX.  Perhaps a compromise could be proposed for the PX to return our collateral over and above our highest potential refund liability to the PX in the CA refund case.	

2.	Seeking injunctive relief in court to prevent the PX from drawing on the letter of credit.

Elizabeth, please advise if this answers your questions fully.

Thanks,  Ray

Subject:	RE: 

I agree. 

Schedule 2, section 2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall post collateral for 100 % of its requirements in excess of the unsecured line of credit in order to participate in the CTS and Core Markets""  [I would note that (1) our ""requirements"" are currently zero, and (2) we do not wish, nor is it possible to ""participate"" in the CTS and Core Markets.  Therefore, the PX has no basis under its Tariff to continue to hold our collateral.]

As you indicated below, Schedule 2, section 2.2 says:  ""Each PX Participant shall maintain sufficient collateral to cover its aggregate outstanding liabilities in the Day-Ahead and Day-Of markets to and from the PX between cash clearing cycles or during the period in which the liabilities are incurred and when payment is billed and settled.""  

Options:

1.  If the PX will allow us to have access to our excess cash pursuant to Section 2.5 (requests submitted by COB Wednesday will be processed by Friday), then let them cash in the LC.

2.  Ask the PX if we can substitute ""other liquid collateral acceptable to the PX. .  .in lieu of cash"" (Schedule 2, section 2.1.3).  We should ask them what else would be acceptable (a lien on Jeff Skilling's house?).

Steve, I believe that schedule 2, section 2.2 of the CalPX tariff is the provision that requires market participants to maintain collateral, the purpose of which, however, is to provide security for liabilities incurred in the PX markets.  Since these markets are no longer in operation, there is no lawful reason to withhold the collateral, notwithstanding the assertions of CA parties that it should be used to guarantee payment of refunds ordered in the CA refund proceeding at FERC.

Elizabeth, per our conversation, I am obtaining and attaching various pleadings before FERC I've worked on seeking return of the collateral and the reasons why it should not be withheld by the PX.  It's my understanding that these might help- please let me know.  There are other related filings and I will forward them as soon as I locate.  In the meantime, I am working with Steve Hall to get an independent interpretation of the PX tariff so as to yield answers to our questions and our options.  Thanks,  Ray

Attached is a suggested form of UCC1 financing statement for use with New
Power.  Note that the Tax ID numbers need to be added for the Enron parties
and we need to determine if New Power is a transmitting utility.  Assuming
New Power is largely a power marketer, we would not want to make an
affirmative election on that issue.  Do you have any views on this the facts
or this issue?

I assume that by now NPW has and is reading the documents.  They may need
turn around on these documents at a time none of us can anticipate.  Please
let us know when you get wind of the need.  We really do want to be of help.

"Forward Contract Advice","David:
We need your and your firms' assistance regarding various forward contract issues that we continually seem to face as we develop new trading products and as we deal with our existing contracts in a distressed counterparty or bankruptcy situation.  I thought that it would be helpful to summarize what we need done before we talk to you.  Here are the areas that we need your advice on:

1.	Obtaining Forward Contract Status	

	a.	All requirements deals
	b.	bundled service contracts
	c.	can only forward contract merchants terminate?  If enter into single output contracts, does that affect our status as a forward contract merchant?  (ewg, QF issues)
	d.	review of Polaroid contract
	e.	Review of EES retail contracts in general
	f.	spot masters - are they forward contracts?

2.	Termination Payments - is it considered a pre-petition or post-petition claim?

3.	Utility Status - is any Enron entity a utility under the Code?

4.	Swaps - can some of our ""physical"" contracts be recharacterized as swaps?

5.	Collateral other than cash and LC's - can it be liquidated without relief from the stay?


Ed Essandoh, an attorney with EES, will be faxing to you a copy of the Energy Management Agreement that EES has with Polaroid Corporation.  We would like for you to review it and give us your thoughts on whether it would qualify as a forward contract.  Ed's direct dial number is 713-345-8939.

Can you contact my assistant, Sandy Haldeman, to schedule some time for Ed and I to talk to you about the above?  Sandy's direct dial number is 713-345-3879.  I will be out of pocket most of tomorrow morning but feel free to call Ed directly with respect to the Polaroid contract.  We have assumed that your firm will not have a conflict on this but if this is a problem, please let us know.

As always David, we look forward to working with you on this.

of you might be available to call-in to tomorrow's meeting for the

give folks some background first.  Hoping you might be able to do this
tomorrow.  Also wondering if you would be able to forward me a copy of your

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Re: December 6 Meeting Time & Scope","
Mitch - DeDe and I are each arriving the prior night, so we can begin  early. I have not heard back from others as to when their plances arrive, so I  suggested 10:30 in my original e-mail on this.  But subject to plane  schedules, the earlier the better.
 
If I remember correctly, AEP uses business casual dress. Is that  appropriate for this meeting?  Your call, Mitch. 
 
It would be helpful if attendees advise me or my assistant of the names and  e-mails of the perions you are bringing with, so we have a good talley of the  attendees and can contact them, if necessary.

Noel Trask inquired when is the December 6  meeting supposed to start and
end and whether we ask business people familiar  with the MISO rules to also
attend -- maybe allow each company to
bring  one person if they want to?
I think it is important that we all agree how  to proceed so, please advise
how all of you would like to proceed.

"Terminations by Wabash Power, GPU Energy, Ameren","(1)  I've reconfirmed through Documentation that Wabash's termination, (stated to be effective Dec 19, 2001) was as to all wholesale power transactions between EPMI and Wabash.

(2) GPU Services has delivered a notice of termination as to all transactions with EPMI. We will be treating all wholesale power Transactions with GPU as terminated but have not had to make a final concluision as to the effective date of such termination. (They've sought to make their terminations effective Dec.21, 2001, though they had to give us a month's notice on the agrement by which EPMI sells to GPU, so that termination weffective date would be January 21, 2001.)

(3) Ameren Energy Inc. has sent us a notice of termination dated December 18, 2001, which appears to be a termination and calculation of settlement payment as to all transactions with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. -- I am trying to obtain a verification on the breaadth of this termination notice.

Elizabeth Sager indicated that Wabash has given appropriate termination notice on all transactions associated with the EEI. I will confirm with David Portz to make sure their termination notice covers any one off contracts in the event they exist.


David:

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise.

"RE: Protect Your Most Important Investment with Deed Restrictions","I rent a small cottage in the Heights and have lived in the Heights for the
past 8 years.  I love it for the very reasons Jeff Balke has stated.  I also
love not having to get on the freeway to drive to work every day - I used to
live in Kingwood.  I don't want to see huge townhomes built on every
available property because ten years from architectural styles will change
again and some of this new construction will appear even more ugly than it
is now.  Just my opinion.

	Well, this isn't Kingwood (thank God).  It is one thing to eliminate
	businesses that create a significant problem for traffic, noise or
whatever
	else.  It is another altogether to eliminate the existence of
businesses.

	This is a community and, by definition, requires a little bit of
everything.
	I, personally, would hate to lose places where I can walk to eat
like Java
	Java or pick up some gardening supplies like Buchanan's or shop for
some
	antiques.  Those businesses are part of the charm of the community
that is
	the Heights.  Without them, we are just another deed restricted
suburb of
	Houston.

"Updated EPMI/EES draft ICAP paper","Attached is the final draft of this paper for comment.  It incorporates the comments of those who responded but there is time for further redrafting.  However, given the filing deadline (Wednesday) further changes are likely to be wordsmithing unless someone vehemently objects to the structure.

regards
Mike ext. 57634

PS.  There were no objections to my thoughts on structure so we have concentrated on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  We then state that if others have different views, any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions.  Finally we attach a simple interim solution as an appendix (so it does not detract from our main argument structure) so that if there is an ongoing debate we will be able to take part...

QSEs that are owed monies from ERCOT on invoices that are due today, October 15, 2001, will notice that the amount of funds transferred is short of the balance due on the invoice. This is a notification that ERCOT will follow the ""short payment"" procedure stated in the ERCOT protocols for payments being made to QSEs today.  Due to short payments by one or more QSEs, ERCOT is insufficient of funds to pay all amounts in full.  As described in the ERCOT protocols, section 9.4.4, ERCOT will deduct ERCOT administrative fees and reduce payments to all invoice recipients that are owed monies. The reductions will be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each ERCOT creditor for this invoice to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT's accounts on the payment date to insure revenue neutrality for ERCOT. ERCOT will distribute past due funds on a pro rata basis of monies owed on the next business day after receipt of the monies. 
If you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service representative.

I received a call this morning from Robert Minkoff.  His company is interested in buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I have not had any involvement in the PCA matter for quite some time, so I told him that I would pass along his name and number to someone who might know whether EPMI has any interest in selling its claim.  His telephone number is 201-968-0001.

Attention:  Kathy Moore

Kathy, thanks for your help.

The historical trading information we are looking for are for the Off-peak
monthly/bimonthly/quarterly and/or annual contracts for the 12 months of
December 2001 through November 2002 for the trading locations of Into
Cinergy and PJM West.

We need the trading information for these contracts for the 10 trading days
of October 8, 16, and 24 and November 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

We would appreciate all of the information you have archived on these
contracts for these trading days, including, as available, bids and asks
(at closing, and if available, throughout the day), transactions and
volumes, and the day's volume-weighted prices.

As we discussed, the reason for this request is that American Electric
Power received an Order from the Virginia State Corporation Commission
(VASCC) to use EnronOnline market prices along with others for the
determination of competitive transition charges (wires charges) for VA
retail customers.

By this e-mail, AEP is also seeking approval to disclose the market prices
provided by EnronOnline to the VASCC, and other parties as necessary, as a
part of this filing.  This filing is due at the VASCC this coming Monday,
December 3rd.

Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
Thanks again for your help.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"Grant PUD Status Report","Status of Grant PUD Termination

EPMI has a WSPP Master Agreement with the Grant Public Utility District (""Grant ""PUD"").  Grant PUD terminated this agreement with EPMI on December 13, 2001.  All transactions were for physical power, and were documented and confirmed under the WSPP agreement.  Pursuant to a pre-petition agreement, at least two of the deals were converted to a cash payment and the physical delivery obligation was cancelled.

Grant calculated the termination payment as being $16,454,632.  On December 18, 2001, Grant paid this amount to Enron Account No. 40781075.  Our forward curves show that Grant still owes us approximately $450,000.   We are working with Grant PUD to ""true up"" the termination payment, and we expect to reach an agreement soon on the true-up payment.

We have not agreed to a release of claims, and are awaiting guidance from Houston before we proceed with a release or similar action.

"Adv: Reduce outside counsel fees, increase in-house expertise","Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys

As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of ""reinventing the wheel"", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!
al!
ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.

LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality. Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.  LRSolutions' attorneys truly enjoy doing research, and analyzing complex legal issues.  In addition, we work with our network of legal experts that include hundreds of the nation's premier law professors and other distinguished attorneys organized intuitively into areas of specialty. Only experts in the field can produce a product in the most efficient manner, without
missing crucial issues and predict ultimate cost.  Now, for a predetermined, fixed price, you can combine legal expertise with enormous cost savings.  Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com.

Our products and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials such as appellate briefs and court filings, regulatory handbooks and manuals in every conceivable area of law (enabling your company to better manage risk and raise legal awareness), contract and other document drafting, settlement packages, and listings of relevant authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and objective that best suits your needs.  We can work with your outside counsel as part of your overall legal team, or provide an alternative to utilization of outside counsel as well as support for in-house projects.

If you would like to contact me by phone, please feel free to call at 1-800-627-8047, ext. 1.  Again, our website is http://www.lrsolutions.com.  Please also feel free to reply via email as well.

"RE: HYDA  -5","How swift death's hand can arrive to touch any and all.  By analogy,  I guess we are all experiencing the sudden death of an illusion.  I would say the death of that poor faithful animal is more significant than the death of a vain illusion.  And, the fact that you would be the kind of person who would respond as you obviously did, out of compassion and tenderness, is a more important fact than some fucking number some Street agency is assigning to our misery in some wretched board room atop a commercial temple.   ----cgy

One for the HYDA  index for Nov 8:

At 8:15 last night, after a day of what surely was the lowest point in my Enron journey, I went home.  Upon arrival, an old black dog was hit by a car that sped away.  The dog died at 9:00 on my doorstop.  We helped our neighbors bury him.  Lets hope the crows know something different for today's report.

Oh, Nov 8th was also my husband's birthday.  Obviously no party.

Thursday     -5


The pronounced slow down in trading and the release of the restatement of income figures, amounting as the numbers did,  to another heavy ""foot falling,""  are substantive factors that are not mitigated by the fact that the Street stayed its raised boot from punting us across the junk bond  line and that the Dynagy merger talks apparently continue, while the Mordant news further darkens the perception of the inner sanctum of the commercial temple.  

 What does it mean that as our inexorable fall continues step by step,  the crows, those sable messengers that were flying up and down this very river at this very site when Rome fell, are showing increasingly positive signs?  Today, several couples danced with what could only be seen as playfulness on the upcurrents of warm air that abound in and around the buildings,  gamboling aviary dyads  in the bright sun above the scarlet leaves, their dance upon the wind currents clearly celebratory, even to our reluctant, jaded eyes, sickened with foul corruption.    ----cgy

I received info from CSC showing a balance due of $117, 205.53.  The balance shown on the EES spreadsheet shows  a claim of $117,880,00.  There is also a note in the comments section of the spreadsheet that the dollars may not be valid  since ENA might have received the money.  Also, per the comments, this was being looked into by Tanya Rohauer and there was a settlement with the customer.

Subject: RE: Possible press release before market open on 11/20/01



First version:  First paragraph probably falls under the requirements of SEC Regulation M-A (communications regarding the Enron/Dynegy merger).  This could be viewed as soliciting support for the merger (""?merger is in the best interests of shreholders.."" etc.).  As such, it would have to include the Rule 425 legend and be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 425 (unless you can argue that the reference to the merger is only in a non-substantive way---it doesn't read that way to me).  Also, the reference in that same first paragraph to ""powerful competitor"" may not sit well with the FTC with respect to the antitrust issues (probably not fatal, but we ought to think of another desciptive word).   

Second version:  Technically, I would say ""secured"" by, as opposed to ""supported"" by the assets of the pipelines when referring to the credit support for the facilities.  Second paragraph:  Same comments as the first paragraph in the first version addressed above.  Third paragraph:  I don't think it is a good idea to talk about ""strong verbal indications"" regarding the extension of maturities unless you are just about 100% confident that they will, in fact, be extended.  I think we are sending a message by such a statement that this maturity will be extended.  If there is a chance that it will not, I think this is a risky statement to make.  If it is made, perhaps we should include a forward looking statement factor to the effect ""factors include Enron's ability to restructure scheduled maturities of debt""  (but my first choice would be not to include the quote).  I will try to be in early in the morning if you want to discuss.  Thanks, Rex

Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.

We have 5 days to deliver (some flexibility to view it as 5 business days).  The margin call is for $4,283,512.  It is to cover NIMO for settlement and imbalance risk for EES participation in their ""Supplier Select"" program.

Subject:	NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security

	Molly:

	Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's ""Supplier Select"" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted ""as financial evaluations dictate"". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as ""BBB"" from S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii) the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2.  

	In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an ""A"" bond rating; (iii) a security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least ""BBB"" by S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

	Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional information.

	MLC

Subject:	RE: Enron Email (Goldman Sachs/J Aron)

You asked me to consider whether there would be any advantage to Enron in
entering into this agreement, given the limitations we discussed yesterday.

My conclusion is that the agreement would assist Enron in the event of a
default by a member of the Goldman Sachs group and there is nothing, as a
matter of English law at least, that would make it imprudent to enter into
the agreement.

The reason why I think the agreement assists Enron is that, absent a winding
up of a counterparty under English law, the courts will generally uphold
contractual set-off arrangements. There are obvious advantages to having an
arrangement under which if one member of the Goldman Sachs group experiences
credit problems, Enron can close out all its positions at the same time and
set them off against each other. It is true that if one of the
counterparties is subject to English law winding up proceedings the set-off
will not be effective (because only ""mutual"" obligations can be set off
against each other and this requires two parties which are acting in the
same capacity). However, this should not affect its validity vis a vis other
counterparties and, in particular, will not affect the enforceability of the
netting provisions under the individual master agreements. Mutuality is not
required (outside a winding up) where the set-off is based on contract. The
fact that a counterparty is in administration would not prevent the set-off
from being upheld, whether as regards that counterparty or any of the
others.

I have obviously just focussed on English law. One point I note, however, is
that Section 2(c) states that any automatic termination provision in the
underlying master agreements is inapplicable. This is not a concern as a
matter of English law because automatic early termination is not required
for the netting arrangements to be enforceable. However, the position is
different in certain other jurisdictions (Germany, for example). The risk is
that this provision will affect the underlying netting arrangements as
regards counterparties incorporated in those jurisdictions.

As Paul pointed out yesterday, the fact that the multilateral netting
arrangements would not be enforceable on an insolvency means that you cannot
regard them as creating a net position for regulatory capital purposes
(although this does not affect the recognition of the netting under each
underlying agreement).

I hope this is helpful. If you would like detailed points on the agreement,
please let me know.

Several positive and negative variables cancelled each other out and evidence of a general tightening of counterparty credit policies lay exposed on the vacant landscape, tipping us down a step from yesterday.

"RE: Amendment to Master Credit Agreement","marc, we are in receipt of your email and appreciate the work you have put in on this.
as i am sure that you understand and as has been discussed, we would need to evaluate all the proposed terms and conditions of this proposed transaction all together before seeking to obtain the requisite internal approvals here. it is my understanding that the proposed revision in the advance factor for utility billed receivables from 30 to 50% is not acceptable to the business people that would make a recommendation in the context of those internal approvals. 
it is my understanding that there are some other discussions over the last few days with respect to some ideas of newpower as to how to address further commodity price declines as well.
i think that it would be fruitful at this point to not try to turn these documents unless and until there is a business meeting of the minds. we will read them however and be ready with comments. i think that we could quickly finish them off if an agreement is reached and the requisite internal approvals obtained.  
let me know if you think otherwise and we can discuss...

Subject:	Amendment to Master Credit Agreement

Lisa and Robert:

I attach a revised (new draft from NewPower) version of the Amendment and
General Security Agreement, together with a blacklined version of this
redraft against the last document we received from you.  Our changes, which
we have not had the opportunity to discuss directly with you, include the
following:  a revision of the security interest from a general lien to a
lien on all receivables and inventory only, and an increase in the October
cap from $20 to $25 million (which I understand were agreed between Cronin
and Tribolet); a revision in the definition of Eligible Accounts to reflect
receivables purchase arrangements with certain utilities (which I
understand was agreed between Hermanson and Tribolet); a proposed revision
in the advance factor for utility billed receivables from 30% to 50% (which
has not been agreed but is our proposed fix to give us comfort that the
Eligible Accounts get us up to the $25 million and $40 million limits) and
certain other changes to correct typos or to clarify certain points as to
which I believe we are in agreement.  Notably, this draft contains no
provisions that would protect NewPower against the risk of losing surety
collateral, or the risk of commodity price declines that would require the
posting of additional collateral.  As to the latter risk, my clients and
yours have been exploring swaps and other arrangements that we may employ
to mitigate that risk.

I also attach copies of proposed resolutions for the Business Review
Committee and the Board of Directors in connection with these documents.

On the assumption that these documents are acceptable, we have scheduled a
meeting of the Business Review Committee for this upcoming Tuesday
afternoon (we could not get a quorum any time today or Monday) and assuming
a positive recommendation by  the BRC, immediately thereafter we would
schedule a telephone Board Meeting for all necessary approvals, at which
point the documents could be executed and an 8-K disclosure filed.

                                              Marc E. Manly

At Tanya's request I am sending you a draft of the amendment agreement which would include cash as eligible collateral.  I look forward to hearing from you and your attorney.  The reason why a cash margin payment is not a preference under the Bankruptcy Code is because Section 546 (g) specifically excludes payments made under swap agreements from the preference provisions.

A separate e-mail will follow wirh directions to the house.  I am asking Mike for a number to the house.  Call me when you get there and leave a number.  I'm not sure when I will head out of town tomorrow, but it will be by 2:30pm to avoid traffic.  Also send me you cell phone number.  My cell phone which I will keep on on my trip down is (202) 260-6132.  Also give me a call when you get into Dullus.  If you guys want to sleep here we can have a slumber party.  I have new sleeper couch and the kids could sleep on the floor.

Attached is the rental application. Our plans are taking shape for the trip to Wintergreen.  My sister will be flying into Dullus Thursday night and will head for Charlottesville.  Could she pick the keys up Thursday evening around 8:30 or 9pm and drop off a check at that time? She plans to stay in a hotel Thursday night, but will be the first to arrive at the house on Friday. 
Several questions -   Could you e-mail me directions to your house and to the house in Wintergreen?  I am planning on giving you two checks-  one for $500. for the three nights and one for $150.00 for the deposit. Is that correct? Does Wintergreen have a pool and or a clubhouse of any sort that serves lunch or dinner?  Is there a grill at the house. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

"Potential Dynegy Transactions","Steve,
 
I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy.  I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties.  Basically, West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy.  My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate, unrelated party until the merger closes.  Therefore, we can not ""collaborate"" with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit, legal and risk management procedures.  Is this correct?   If so, how do you feel about the following?
 
An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year.  The customer requires Enron to post collateral.  Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product/services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer.  The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a ""back to back"" transaction.   Dynegy adds a small service fee, the Enron/Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy/Customer contract is executed.  
 
This type of deal happens frequently - it is usually driven by the third party having better credit, transmission access or a complementary service.  We could do this with anyone, but the obvious choice is Dynegy - customers think it makes sense, and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer.  
 
Do you think this works?
 
Regards,
 
Chris

Kay & Rahil:  Just to make my position clear, if legal determines that an EEI is still necessary with this counterparty then we should go forward with pursuing an EEI agreement.

The credit position is that if the deal needs to get done soon, then let's just use the GTCs and we can follow up later with an EEI (if deemed necessary by legal).  If we can wait a couple of weeks, then let's go forward with negotiating an EEI now.

Hopefully this clarifies our position.  Sorry for the confusion.  If the later is the case, then Rahil, I will need to get financial statements from the counterparty and review.

Thank you.

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving ""unit contingent"" power versus ""interruptible"" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

bitch is nine. 
His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, ""What are you doing?"" 
The little boy answered, ""I'm doing my math homework, Mom."" 
""And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?"" the mother asked. 
""Yes,"" he answered. 
Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next day, ""What are you  teaching my son in math?"" 
The teacher replied, ""Right now, we are learning addition."" 
The mother asked ""And are you teaching them to say 'two plus two,  that son of a bitch is four'?"" 
After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered, ""What I taught them was  two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four.'""

Jeremy, 

Thanks for stepping up and taking the WSPP bull (no pun intended) by the horns. I am going to discuss with Elizabeth Sager, throwing our support behind the FERC filing.  I am personally 100% behind the idea, and will urge Elizabeth to support it too.  We will communicate in a more official sense with you soon.  You seem to be taking a broad, big picture, very reasonable approach to the process issue.  This is long overdue.   I like the way you suggested how there might be a place for a persuasive, rather than academic memo about the convergence issue,  or ""creeping imitation"" as I think it is best characterized.  I will begin to write such a memo and ask for your help in fitting it into the process in the most productive way as this strange process continues to unfold.  Thanks again for your efforts and we will get back to you in more detail soon. ----cgy

Subject: Re: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings


I was severely disappointed over being shut out of the WSPP exec committee
meeting.  Apparently, when the guy came in to set up the phone for the call,
Small told him not to do it and sent him out.  I also agree that there seems
to be little regard for the bylaws; ""informality"" is being used to run
roughshod over dissent.

Since we had a representative present (without me, his attorney), we
probably lack standing to make a formal demand that the votes be rescinded
until reintroduced under required conditions.  Otherwise, this e-mail would
be asking you to join us.  However, as many involved on our end were quite
upset, ""disenfranchisement"" could well become a matter for judicial review
if it happens again to PacifiCorp.

I remain amazed that Small would push for revisions, such as those to 32.5,
knowing there was substantial question over their legal effect.  If indeed
Small's wrong on the law, we'd be fully prepared to demand undoing these
changes due to flawed legal advice from Small and ""passage"" out of
compliance with the bylaws, and to do so jointly with others.  In fact, if I
get management okay, I'd be willing to write a joint objection to file with
FERC in response to the introduced amendments.  There may even be some
corporate doctrine under Utah law that prevents a non-profit from paying for
Small's defense in an internecine dispute.

Although you are right that now is not the time for a joint WSPP/EEI
drafting committee, I very much like the idea of proposing one under cover
of a memo that picks out the highlights of convergence after the EEI process
started against the type of amendments that were made before the EEI was on
the table as a dramatic way to make the point that Small's agenda is to
drive WSPP towards competition in a niche filled by the EEI, and hammer on
the other points you've made, with which we fully agree.  I don't know that
there's a need to do the convergence analysis exhaustively and academically,
as opposed to persuasively, unless if you think you can convince a law stude
nt on a local law review that it would make a good note.

I also note from the minutes that a Board of Trustees was elected; I do not
recall being provided with a copy of the slate of nominees in advance of the
meeting.  I admit I didn't spend a lot of time puzzling over it, but I don't
see from the website or the bylaws the authority under which Small conducts
the committee meetings.  It's interesting how the notes on the first day of
the meeting appear to be written by someone who wasn't following the legal
issues involved.

Let me know what you think on the FERC objection idea and whether you'd be
prepared to join us.

Shari,
I'm not sure of what to do about the informal, irregularity of the WSPP
process.  I agree with you that there seems to be a lack of basic due
process going on, but, it has always been difficult to understand how
and why they do things the way they do.  History and personality seem to
explain it best.

 Right near the end of the Thursday session, I believe it was Jeremy
Weinstein of PacifiCorp, tried to focus Mike on what to me seems to be a
crucial, and potentially fruitful question:  Is the WSPP becoming more
and more like the EEI, and if so, does anybody care?  Mike seemed to
feel that there was a vast difference between the two agreements and
that this vast difference mattered a lot.  I think if anybody would take
the time to dispassionately examine the steady stream of changes that
have been made to the WSPP over the past couple of years, the result
would be that the two agreements would be seen to be converging rather
than diverging. I would even take a further step and argue that the
convergence has been so steady and effective, that the time has now
arrived for a Joint EEI/WSPP Drafting Committee to harmonize the
agreements. However, I think my suggestion is still premature.  At this
moment in the process, it would seem that a comparative document,
painstakingly showing each amendment of the WSPP agreement and what it
looked like in comparison to the EEI needs to be created.  If
convergence is what this objective study shows, then, at some point, the
question fairly becomes:  why not get it over with and merge the
documents?  Is a Joint Drafting Committee a good idea?

I may be wrong, and an academic look at my thesis is certainly required,
but my instinct is that Mike's notion that a group-adopted agreement is
fundamentally different than multiple bilateral agreements is a classic
distinction without a difference.  Why does how the agreement is derived
matter if the two agreements are becoming inexorably more and more
alike? Why should I fly up and down the west coast attending a steady
stream of meetings and pay $25K a year to use one agreement when it is
steadily becoming more and more like the other agreement which involves
neither inconvenience?  The creeping imitation of the WSPP process needs
to be recognized for what it is.
I would argue that this approach might bear more fruit than wrangling
over process, although, that too is probably going to be an enduring
necessity. ----cgy

Subject: FW: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings


I don't know who has had time to read the latest WSPP email  - but the
provision below was NOT adopted in accordance with std. procedure. At
the Contracting Committee meeting in Colorado Springs on Aug. 10- this
provision did not get the requisite percentage to pass on to the
Operating Committee (in the meeting summary, he noted that it got a
""supermajority"" - whatever that is.)  At the Operating Committee meeting
in Idaho, Mike Small again proposed this change but said that there did
not need to be a vote since it was going to be part of the ""operating
procedures"". Now it appears that he has ""snuck"" it into the WSPP
Agreement and took advantage of the fact that many did not attend the
meeting in San Diego in reliance on being able to attend via conference
call. As we all know, Mike Small arbitrarily canceled the call that
would have allowed us to participate in the Executive Committee meeting.
I suspect he did so because he knew we would object to this clause and
therefore the 90% would not have been achieved.

Any thoughts on what to do about this??

S

_________________________________________________________


A new Section 32.5 to limit changes to the WSPP Agreement that may be
made automatically through the confirmation process after the five day
was adopted.  Under this new provision, non-standard confirmation
provisions (e.g. changes to the basic terms of the WSPP Agreement) may
be adopted only if there is explicit agreement to those changes and not
by operation of the five day rule.  The modification adopted at the
Executive Committee was to limit the oral agreements allowing such
modifications to transactions of less than one week.  This provision as
modified was adopted with only one dissenting vote.

Based on the latest Master Netting Agreement Assignment List, you are assigned to one or more ""houses"" to prepare a Master Netting Agreement.  I am currently working on excising natural gas receivables from an existing gas receivable facility known as the Swee'P Receivables Facility.  This ""excisement"" is a prerequisite to our actual execution of the various Master Netting Agreements on which you are working.  In order for me to accomplish the excisement, I need to create a list of each of the non-Enron legal entities, which will be parties to the Master Netting Agreement you have been assigned.  The legal entities are needed so that we may assure that none of these legal entities will have its payables to ENA transferred to Swee'P.  The final submission of receivables is due on Monday, November 5th.  The list I am requesting from you will allow Leslie Reeves to excise your complete ""house"" from the submission of receivables.

I know that each of you are swamped, but this excisement is a prerequisite to the execution of the Master Netting Agreements.  Even if you have only a rough list of the entities in your house, please provide your best available information to me via email, copying the CCs listed on this email.  Thank you for your assistance.

In addition to Sandhills Enron also made a 203 filing this year in respect of the sale of the New Albany plant to Duke. You will probably need to run a check on Enron at FERC to ensure that between us we have identified any changes to the three year update for EPMI which was prepared at the beginning of this year.

"RE: Master Netting agmt.:  AEP","Jason -- Please note that (1) there is a 1/1/98 GISB in effect between AEP Services, Inc and ENA following assignment of such GISB by Columbia Energy Marketing to ENA under a Nov. 22, 1999 Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Such GISB is referenced in the current draft Netting Agreement currently under AEP's review.  (2) The wholesale power trading masters identified and referenced in the current draft Netting Agreement are a Power Sales Agreement dated as of September 29, 1997  providing for sales of wholesale electric power by EPMI to AEP, and a Service Agreement dated as of March 30, 1998 under the AEP Companies' Wholesale Market Tariff, providing for sales of wholesale electric power by AEP to EPMI.  (3) You indicated below that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  These relationships would be pulled in by the Master Netting Agreement's catch-all Recital defining ""Other Agreements""  unless Credit determines with AEP that these trading relationships are to be excluded, and language is added to that effect. -  David

Sara,

As we discussed, we  would like to notify our customers of our current status and our ability to look after them.  Here is a brief summary of the services contracts and obligations that we currently have along with the notification letter we would like to send them.  Please let us know if we are ok to send these out.

Thanks,

Tom.


MDEA
purchase power for the cities
purchase and schedule gas as agent to supply the cities generating units
real-time operational coordination via our control room to balance the cities load and resources

MDEA relies entirely on EPMI for this as they have no other enabling agreements or marketing/scheduling capability.  We are no longer able to purchase power for them but are able to schedule gas as their agent.  The sities could incur signifigant imbalance charges as a result of our inability to perform.

 

QSE Customers

Green Mountain Power (BP Energy), New Power Company, XERS (starts Jan 1) 

We schedule all power contracts with ERCOT
We settle all charges and payments with ERCOT (ERCOT settles with EPMI and EPMI settles with customer)

 

Frontera

We market the output of the Frontera plant (450 MW) 
We buy to suppy Frontera's obligations (call options to EPMI and Mirant) when the market is below Frontera's cost.
We schedule all transactions as QSE

Frontera has no other enabling agreements and relies on EPMI for all trading activities.

Subject:	NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security

	Molly:

	Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's ""Supplier Select"" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted ""as financial evaluations dictate"". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as ""BBB"" from S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii) the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2.  

	In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an ""A"" bond rating; (iii) a security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least ""BBB"" by S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

	Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional information.

	MLC

"Faith-based contracting","I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours.  Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs, munis, and federal PMA's I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract, it's almost a religion.  One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran.

Whether it's assimilation or merger, or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education, we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract.  Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract.---""Why should I change, the agreements are virtually identical?""

Elizabeth, 

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories. 

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.   

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements. 

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions. 

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.   

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result. 
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.   ----cgy

At our group meeting this morning, the general consensus was that we should continue to send margin letters to those counterparties that have not yet terminated.  Can Harlan and I meet with you sometime this afternoon to talk about this so that we can keep track of what is being done?  Anytime after 1 works for me.

Subject:	Update following our meeting re. VEPCO
Importance:	High

Everyone,

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP"" (the ""Index""). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

Electricity Restructuring Gets Push  From Republicans
Republican members of the Energy and Air  Quality Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have agreed with  Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, that restructuring legislation should  move forward now that Congress has a few more weeks in session. In an 8-2 vote  last week, Republican Committee members decided to continue drafting electricity  restructuring legislation. Electricity restructuring provisions were excluded  from the energy bill approved by the House earlier this year. The issue was to  be readdressed in the fall but was delayed due to the events on September 11th.  No action has been taken to date in the Senate.
Green Mountain Energy Expands Into  Ohio's Restructured Market
Green Mountain Energy Company has  entered into an agreement with the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council (NOPEC)  to service northeastern Ohio with solar and wind-generated electricity. NOPEC  was formed last year under Ohio's utility deregulation statute Senate Bill 3,  which allows local governments to serve as aggregators for electricity  customers. NOPEC consists of 100 local communities with approximately 500,000  energy customers. Under the agreement, Green Mountain Energy will construct a  25-kilowatt solar array at Lake Farmpark in Kirtland, Ohio, and will conduct a  study to determine the feasibility of siting a wind generating facility in Ohio.  The Green Mountain Energy solar array will be the largest in the state and the  first commercial solar array in Ohio built for the competitive market. The  proposed wind study will be the first commercial wind analysis executed solely  for the competitive market.
Debate Over Deregulation Impacts in  Oklahoma
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has reported, in a  first-of-its kind study, that restructuring Oklahoma's electric industry can  benefit consumers, but problems and potential pitfalls do exist. The report has  been met with some opposition however. Pete Churchwell, president of Oklahoma's  second largest electric utility AEP/PSO, stated on November 16th that he does  not support the study's findings, one of which indicates that Oklahoma's energy  costs could rise between 5 and 25 percent if the retail electricity market is  opened to competition. The study results indicate that lower electric prices may  be available in the short term, but restructuring will ultimately bring higher  prices. Under the state's restructuring plan, existing generating plants will  have a competitive advantage over new plants. This advantage will result in  higher prices in the long term because newer, higher-cost plants may be forced  out of the marketplace. Churchwell contests that it is too early to know for  certain how consumer rates will react in a deregulated market. While admitting  that the nation's grid was not designed for retail competition, Churchwell said  that improvements in state transmission systems would allow a successful retail  competitive market.
Utility still looks to be freed of  generators
Clark Public Utilities has been trying in vain for  two months to unload some of the 50 portable generators that have become a  multimillion-dollar white elephant.  The units, wired in rows near the  River Road Generating Plant, were leased for a year for $19.5 million. The deal  was signed with General Electric early this year, at a time when there were dire  predictions about this summer's power supply.  In addition to the equipment  lease, there is a $15 million natural gas contract to power the generators and a  roughly $12 million expense to transport the gas. While Clark has been able to  resell some of the gas at a loss, the transportation costs can't be  recouped.  For weeks, electricity on the open market has been much cheaper  than that produced by the generators.  In place since July, the generators,  each producing 1 megawatt of power, have run for just 39 days.  Electricity  prices have plunged, from a high of $325 per megawatt-hour this summer to less  than $30 today. The price has to be about $95 to make operating the generators  feasible. So utility officials have had no choice but to let them sit  idle.  In September, the net expense for the generator farm gas, generator  lease and so on was $3.5 million. For no electricity.  Utility officials  have tried to get GE to find customers for at least some of the  generators.  Tuesday morning, Andy Huck, Clark's operations director, said  he had heard from GE about a ""pretty serious inquiry"" for two generators for two  months. And that, he said, ""is the best inquiry they've had so far.""  Now,  utility officials are trying to decide whether to keep spending $62,000 a month  for three GE employees and other expenses associated with maintaining the  generators.  The theory is that the equipment should be tested, a few at a  time, to ensure they will be ready if needed.  ""They told me the generators  need to be 'exercised,'"" said Huck. ""I told them they spent two months on a ship  without being started."" The units were built in Austria.  GE, with a signed  one-year lease in hand, has little incentive to find customers for the  equipment, particularly when the company could presumably lease other generators  from its inventory.  ""They say it's because we're such good client"" that an  effort has been made to find other users for the generators, said Huck. Clark's  $120 million River Road generating plant features a giant GE turbine.   Clark officials don't hold out much hope of getting out from under the generator  lease expense, which runs about $1.3 million per month. ""Where would they go?""  asked Jim Sanders, Clark's director of energy resources.  Meanwhile, the  natural gas supply for the equipment is being resold at about half what it cost  the utility. Gas prices also have fallen since the supply deal was inked.   At their regular Tuesday meeting, utility commissioners decided to proceed with  a $100 million bond sale that includes money to pay for the generator  lease.  In March, Rick Dyer, Clark's finance director, recommended that the  utility cut a deal for a one-year, $100 million ""bond anticipation note."" The  arrangement was made on the assumption that interest rates would fall in a few  months, which they have to 1961 levels.  The move Tuesday gave Dyer and  utility General Manager Wayne Nelson the OK to approve a bond sale of up to 15  years at 6 percent interest although 5 percent or less is more likely, and the  goal is a 10-year term, officials said.  The bond sale likely will occur in  the first week of December. The bulk of the $100 million borrowing is to cover a  $63 million power purchase from Kaiser Aluminum. The deal, like the generator  lease, was for power to cover an August-September gap in Clark's power supply,  before the start of a Bonneville Power Administration contract.  That  Kaiser purchase was at $325 a megawatt-hour. The utility lost a bid to have a  federal judge declare the price exorbitant and order a partial refund.     
AEP, Reliant Named as Last Resort  Providers in Texas
The Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) has  named American Electric Power (AEP) and Reliant Resources affiliates ""providers  of last resort"" (POLR) for residential and small-commercial customers in all or  part of 96 counties within TXU Electric's service area. The POLR becomes the  electricity provider for customers who have been dropped by their past provider  due to payment problems or if their provider has discontinued service in their s  area. AEP and Reliant will offer a retail price that is expected to be 30-34  percent higher than base rates in the area taking effect January 1, 2002. By  becoming the POLR, AEP and Reliant will acquire an additional 2 million  Dallas-area customers and an expected 1-20 percent load increase. Due to the  higher costs associated with such an increased load the PUC was agreeable to the  higher rate. Consumer groups are opposing the higher rates, saying that  low-income consumers will be unfairly hurt. Although many low-income consumers  will qualify for a 10 percent discount advocates are arguing that POLR rates  should equal the regular rates.
Studies Show Changing Consumer Views  Towards Deregulation
A recent study by Deloitte and Touche  Energy Resources Group finds that consumers are less aware of deregulation in  the electric industry and more wary of its potential benefits. The survey  considered the opinions of 657 consumers nationwide and found that the number of  consumers who are aware of changes in retail electric markets has dropped to  39.7 percent, compared with 50.5 percent in 2000. This is a reversal in a  five-year trend of increasing consumer awareness on deregulation. Analysts cited  the terrorist attacks and the lack of federal legislation or debate on  deregulation as reasons for the change. The survey also found that more  consumers expect electric rates to increase with deregulation. Deloitte and  Touche's Brank Terzi reports that a third of consumers expect no benefit from  competition, while 26 percent expect prices to go down, 9 percent expect  improved service, and 15 percent simply ""don't know."" Another study completed by  RKS Research and Consulting similarly found that many consumers feel that  ""deregulation has been a colossal failure."" Their study found that many  consumers who have switched to new service providers have been disappointed  because their service expectations were not met. RKS Senior Vice President  Carmine Grastataro said, ""customers of public power are more satisfied with the  job their utility is doing than are customers of the IOUs. Although this finding  has historically remained true, the difference in performance scores between  public power and IOUs is exacerbated in states where competition is under way.""  The study also found that consumers are more interested in purchasing power  through buying groups, voluntary energy curtailment programs, and on-site  generation.
FERC Postpones December 15 RTO  Deadline
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has  officially decided to postpone the December 15, 2001, deadline for utilities to  create four regional transmission organizations (RTO). FERC Chairman Pat Wood  said of the decision, ""RTO development is in very different stages in various  parts of the country, and it is not possible for all RTOs to be in operation by  the December 15, 2001, deadline established in Order 2000."" The commission has  approved a rulemaking order, RM01-12, that addresses the development of RTOs in  several steps. First, the Commission will develop a broader definition of the  expected functions of an RTO and how they can be achieved. Second, FERC will  seek improved input and communication from both state and federal agencies on  RTO development. Third, FERC will conduct a formal cost benefit analysis of RTO  systems. This comes in response to two conflicting studies: NY ISO reports that  a large Northeast RTO could cause power rates to increase by $90 million, while  Mirant contends that a Northeast RTO could save consumers $440 million. The  rulemaking also calls for FERC to determine areas in which standardization can  be improved. Lastly, a new ""progressive"" timeline will be developed that  addresses RTO development in a region-by-region approach. While Chairman Wood  said that the commission is holding to its original concept of four RTOs, he  also noted that the new order suggests that three smaller RTOs may be developed  within the Western region. These transmission groups would include RTO West,  Desert Star RTO, and one based on the California ISO. The rulemaking also makes  a call for comments in what Commissioner Nora Brownell noted as possibly the  last opportunity for market participants and state regulators to make  suggestions and raise concerns before final orders are issued.
Ontario deregulation in  doubt 
The planned  deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in  doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity  transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an  open North American power market. The plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike  Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a  not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this  happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make  acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's  premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive  officer Eleanor Clitheroe. David Lindsay, the president and chief executive  officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser,  confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to  Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration.  ""We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this  one,"" he said yesterday. He would not provide details, though it is thought that  the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership  structure by the conclusion of the year. A senior official in the Ontario  government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal ""is a step  backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro."" He was referring to the debt-laden  utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating  arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans  30,000 kilometres. The Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for  Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that ""there are a number of options on  the table."" Sources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning  Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the  chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest  dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion  through the sale of bonds to investors. The dealers' commission on the sale of  the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would  range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said. Mr. Harris  is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to  the government to help pay down the $21-billion in ""stranded debt"" racked up by  the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long  spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the  province's balance sheet. Hydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to  electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of  bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One  lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company  instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The  United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial  risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders. Executives at RBC  Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality  concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring. The  government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and  sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated  turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent  owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the  leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would  be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public  offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the  stock exchange. The third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit  organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option,  though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of  which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would  eventually become a commercial enterprise. Sources said that Hydro One  management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One  the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The  not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises  potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies  might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive  advantage. It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially  lucrative share options.  Rod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president,  would not comment on the not-for-profitoption being contemplated by the  government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability  to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market.  ""Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in  the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,"" he said  in a phone interview. Stanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall  Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a  not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser  to Hydro One's strategic business plan). In a three-page letter sent this week  to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said  that ""this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario."" He argued that ""the  absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit  corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers."" He also  said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to  invest in ""new bottleneck-eliminating connections"" that would allow the company  to become a significant electricity exporter. ""Ontario would lose the prospect  of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,"" he said. In a  recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote,  ""With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well  positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United  States, where ownership tends to be fragmented."" He noted that Hydro One is  expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has  ""the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into  competitive high-growth initiatives."" According to sources familiar with the  not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of  all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from  corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper  companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the  board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers.  Restructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the  most efficient way to capitalize the company. ""The problem with a Canadian  National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,"" said  one financier familiar with the proposal. ""With a debt-based structure, every  dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure  means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt  payments."" Dofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about  $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord  Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's  stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity  charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to  whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year.  ""We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,"" Mr. Forstner said. ""Until  that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding  outside of Ontario's boundaries.""
Retail Access Requested in  California
The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) has  asked the California Supreme Court to overturn the state Public Utilities  Commission's September 20th decision that suspended direct retail access across  the state. The consumer group, comprised of American Utility Network, the  Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, California League of Food Processors,  Western Power Trading Forum, Strategic Energy, AB&I Foundry, Tricon Global  Restaurants and School Project for Utility Rate Reduction, has argued that the  ruling was made without due process and that the Court had no right to abrogate  contracts retroactively. ""It is our hope that the Supreme Court recognizes the  PUC has acted in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and has rushed  to judgment on this issue, without hearings and without creating a proper  evidentiary record,"" said AReM Attorney Dan Douglass. PUC Commissioner Carl Wood  has maintained that the PUC issued the order because it believed that consumers  have hastily signed contracts with competitive suppliers, leaving fewer  customers to pay for the state's wholesale power costs. AReM is disputing the  claim, saying that only a limited number of customers switched suppliers during  the summer of 2001.
Plant Construction Influences  Florida's Wholesale Market
California based Calpine Corporation  announced that it has begun construction of a 530 megawatt power plant in  Auburndale, Florida. The construction brings Florida closer to deregulation, as  Calpine is one of the few out-of-state generating companies to successfully  penetrate Florida's wholesale electricity market. Other companies, such as  Enron, have attempted to construct new power plants in the state, but have been  unsuccessful due to community and regulatory resistance. Florida's stringent  Power Plant Siting Act makes it very difficult for out-of-state companies to  enter the market. Calpine has succeeded by agreeing to sell the output from the  Auburndale plant under a long-term contract to one of Florida's existing  utilities, Seminole Electric Cooperative. In addition, Calpine has been working  with the Florida Partnership for Affordable Competitive Electricity to persuade  lawmakers and Governor Bush to deregulate Florida's wholesale market. Florida's  Energy 2020 Study Commission, which is responsible for the state's competition  plan, has endorsed a proposal to allow out-of-state companies to enter Florida's  wholesale market by building new plants and selling power to the state's  incumbent utilities. The Commission has also suggested eliminating the power of  state government to approve power plant development and limiting the ability of  local governments to block projects. The Commission is expected to issue a final  report on December 1, 2001.
Florida PSC Approves Independent  Power Line Operations
The Florida Public Service Commission  (PSC) has approved the transfer of the state's power lines from utility  jurisdiction to an independent company. The PSC has asked Florida's three main  utilities, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Florida and Power Corporation, and  Tampa Electric, to devise a proposal within 90 days that will turn over  operation of the power lines to an independent system operator. Commissioner  Michael A. Palecki said that the decision was made in the best interest for  ratepayers, utility companies and independent power companies seeking a  competitive market. Under an earlier proposal submitted to the PSC, the  utilities proposed a statewide regional transmission organization, GridFlorida,  that would have owned and managed the power lines. The PSC did not approve the  plan, as it would have moved jurisdiction of retail rates to the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission.
New England Congressmen Seek Equal  Representation on RTO Board
Twenty-three U.S. congressmen from  New England requested that their states be given adequate representation on the  governance of the Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO.) In an  effort organized by Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass), the bipartisan  delegation of congressmen wrote a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC) asking the regulators to create a governing board comprised of  equal numbers of representatives from New England, New York, and the  Mid-Atlantic. ""We view an equally balanced governance structure as the only way  in which a single market design can be implemented which would truly benefit the  consumers of all the regions,"" Markey said. FERC has been considering several  options for structuring the board that will oversee the unified Northeast  wholesale power market. One proposal gives five seats for representatives from  the Mid-Atlantic, three seats to New York, and two to New England. ISO New  England and New York Independent System Operator joined the congressman in  opposing that plan and requesting equal representation.
California Wants Consumers to See  Real Power Costs
In a move that may prevent a repeat meltdown of  the wholesale electricity market in California, the California Consumer Power  and Financing Authority wants to install electricity meters that charge  consumers the real cost of power. Currently consumers pay the same price for  electricity throughout the day even though the wholesale price varies every  hour. Therefore, consumers have no incentive to conserve during peak times. The  meters will charge residential consumers more for power used during peak hours,  when demand is highest and less during off peak times. The authority issued  requests for proposals, due by November 15, for a minimum of 10,000 real-time  meters, the cost of which varies between $200 and $1,000. The power authority  plans to finance the purchase of the meters and will market them to customers of  Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas &  Electric and dozens of municipal utilities. As consumers have shown to be  responsive to price signals in a pilot program in Washington, Californians too  can expect to reduce their energy consumption. Project manger, Kevin Wood of  Southern California Edison hopes his company will install meters for 11,000  customers by next summer. He said that if these customers, who represent 20 to  30 percent of the load, respond to price signals during peak hours, this may in  turn drive down wholesale prices for all users. While consumers may benefit, the  decrease in consumption may cost power generators millions of dollars in  revenue.
Environmentalists and Union Coalition  Oppose Deregulation in Indiana
A coalition of union members from  several groups showed their opposition to electric utility deregulation in  Indiana during a peaceful demonstration on November 7. The coalition, know as  People's Energy Campaign, includes members from UNITE Local 399, formerly the  Ladies Garment Workers Union, the Central Labor Council, Valley Watch  environmental group, and the Citizens Action Coalition. Denny Owen, an executive  board member of UNITE Local 399, expressed the general concern of the coalition  that deregulation should be discouraged. ""We don't think it'll make prices  lower, it'll make them go higher,"" Owen said. Indiana is considered to have low  utility rates compared to other states. Indiana lawmakers are considering  deregulation as newly introduced legislation proposes to create an Energy Policy  Commission that would craft a comprehensive energy plan for the state. Senator  Gard and other General Assembly members created the bill to address the state's  need for a true energy policy and as a means to address future electric load  growth. ""Merchant power plants have been a divisive issue in the past year and a  half,"" Gard said. ""There are many people who feel if the state has a  comprehensive energy policy, it might be better able to deal with this issue.  And we also have to pay attention to what's happened in California."" The bill  would set up a temporary commission with appointed members representing various  stakeholder groups including state government, industry, labor, and  environmental groups. The commission is scheduled to present a final report to  the governor in December 2002. While electric deregulation would not be a prime  focus of the commission, the ""specter of deregulation"" would have to be examined  in some fashion, Senator Gard said. SB 233 has been sent to the Senate Rules and  Legislative Procedures Committee. Senator Gard predicts it will pass the Senate,  although chances in the House of Representatives are less favorable.
Debate Over Oklahoma Transmission  System's Readiness to Serve Future Load
The Electric  Restructuring Advisory Committee met with industry officials on November 7 to  discuss the future capabilities of Oklahoma's transmission system. The committee  is responsible for researching the capabilities of the system, determining  whether upgrades are necessary, and delegating the responsibility for paying for  such upgrades. With new power plants being developed and proposals to open the  state to a competitive electric market in progress, concern has risen as to  whether the transmission system can handle the increased load. Stanton Hadley of  Oak Ridge National Laboratory reported that electricity demand in Oklahoma is  expected to grow 26 percent, to 14,350 megawatts by 2010. The transmission  system currently is able to handle only 13,300 megawatts. Nevertheless, power  companies are planning 13,500 megawatts of new power generation. Calpine  Corporation is spending about $20 million on transmission improvements between  its power plant near Coweta, Oklahoma, and the outlying region. Also, Public  Service Company of Oklahoma plans to spend $40 million on transmission upgrades  over the next few years. With the new power plants and a supply surplus  expected, Hadley also said that consumers could expect lower costs. John Wright,  one of the committee members questioning this assumption, said that in a  deregulated market, the utilities are likely to sell their power out of state.  If this were to occur, lower power prices would be unlikely. The Electric  Restructuring Advisory Committee will deliver a report to the Legislature at the  end of the year.
Thirty New Power Plants Proposed for  Virginia
The latest news out of the deregulation of Virginia's  electric power industry centers around thirty proposals for new power plants in  the state. While the surge in supply is expected to prevent a California-like  energy crisis, health and environmentalists argue that the air pollution and  smog from the plants could damage the state's parks and forests. Since 1998,  when the state announced its plans to open its energy markets to competition, 30  companies and utilities have asked for state approval to build new plants.  Activists complain that the new power would not even benefit Virginia's  customers, as the energy is intended for delivery in northeastern states. By  building plants in Virginia, utilities avoid the Northeast's stringent  environmental regulations. An advisory group composed of utility and industry  representatives argues that new plants pose no significant risk. They stated  that 28 of the new plants would run on cleaner-burning natural gas and that  other federal regulations would require older plants to reduce harmful emissions  by 65 percent by 2004. The representatives also expect that only a few of the  plants will actually be built due to market conditions and cooling-water  shortages.

"Edison Electric Institute/Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement","Elizabeth:

I am one of the contract attorneys from Bracewell & Patterson  assisting EES on various projects.  One of the matters which has been delegated to me is the review of a Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement between EES and A'lones.  I met with Richard Ring yesterday, and he indicated that you might be able to answer a few questions.  

First, Richard has informed me that ENA was heavily involved in the development of this document, and, as a result, the form is used ""as is"" and without amendment, save for information to be provided in the Cover Sheet.  One of my ""marching orders"" is that choice of law provisions in EES paper should require Texas law.  The Edison form opts for New York.  Is this something that can be changed? 

Second, what about more substantive matters, such as who takes the lead in sending transaction confirmations?  In the A'lones transaction, it is contemplated that EES will be the Buyer.  The Edison form places primary confirmation obligations on the Seller.  I am informed that EES prefers to be the confirming party, regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller.  Is this something that can be changed?

Third, there are a variety of typographical and reference errors.  i.e. double commas (see paragraph 2.2), doubled phrases (paragraph 5.1(h)(i)), and possibly mistaken use of defined terms (see use of ""Product"" in second line of paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2).  What is the Company's position on correcting these types of items?

I apologize that this is being e-mailed, as it would probably be quicker by phone, but my connection to the phone system is lagging somewhat behind my connection to the computer network.  Thank you for your time and attention.

Ed
	
As a first step, please could you check the position as to the bonds we have posted and provide me with details as to the volume of trades we have entered into since December 2 this year and for the same period last year. In addition please could you confirm what our NEPOOL Charges have been for the last 12 months.
	
My initial reaction is that, provided the bond holders have not sought to withdraw the bonds and confirm that to us, then ISO-NE's position is considerably weakened. The fact that they only allege ""purported notice"" gives me something to work with, in that it is either notice or it is not.
	
The amount that they are seeking does appear to be on the high side, especially having regard to what I am assuming is  reduced activity by certainly EPMI, in NEPOOL since December 2. 
	
I will review the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy to ensure that there is nothing we have missed and subject to the data and information in respect of the bonds posted by us and the activity data I would seek to challenge this as a valid notice and state that we are still in compliance with the Financial Assurance Policy.

"RE: NEED COMMENTS-Dynegy v. ComEd response","Thanks, Guy.  Your point is valid; however, you are right that we don't want to emphasize the intra-day hourly part in this pleading since a firm power contract is necessary in order to have firm network service (hourly traders purchasing system contigent or unit contingent during the day would be scheduling the network transmission utilizing ""non-designated resource"", which makes the transmission less firm (right above non-firm PTP)).  ComEd's draft response also discusses this in the context that they are following the tariff.  The point we need to make is that the designation of firm LD contracts absolutely meets FERC's network resource requirements.

We have added an argument that, yet again, even having this type of issue with network, PTP, etc. emphasizes the need to move quickly to the market design that we advocate in the context of an RTO, which would eliminate these parochial issues (and without an icap obligation that Dynegy clearly wants.)

Christi:

I'm good with the filing.  The only point I would make is that our ultimate position is that we don't think we should have to designate any network resource in order to get network firm transmission from the utility.  Our hourly traders don't buy power on firm LD contracts and the utilities in the Midwest have supply imbalance rules that more than adequately incentives us to make sure any power we schedule physically gets to the utility boarder.

I am not sure if this filing is the proper time to bring this up, but I wanted to make the point in case it changes our approach.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Tuesday, November 13 and Wednesday, November 14, 2001:  +1

We are finding new footing after a time of  floundering in quicksand.    The solidification of the sense that there is not going to be a quick recovery,  high level remarks about keeping Enron's trading talent intact, and encounters with counterparties like Seattle and Snohomish who seem to take a kind of nonplussed (clueless?) view of the whole situation, all suggest that the storm may be over and we are going to be able to gird up for a long steady march to a different promised land,  Houston toxins notwithstanding.  

In the morning, the crow community seemed harassed by the strong winds and were seen heading up river in a southerly direction, while the afternoon provided a view of a large raptor, some kind of hawk, or perhaps an osprey, circling high above the city's downtown core.

Subject:	RE: Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts

This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the issue of Transportation Contract rejection with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews and Kurth.  He and his partner Jeff Spiers have been advising other Enron divisions regarding the contract rejection process.  

I am told that a motion has been filed with the bankruptcy court requesting that shorthand procedures be established for the purpose of allowing the various Enron Debtors to reject executory contracts.  That motion is apparently slated to be heard on January 7.  The attached template describes the information that must be filed with the court and forwarded to the creditors' committee and to the relevant counterparty whose contract is being rejected.  Assuming that the order is approved, we'll be able to start rejecting transportation contracts as early as January 8.  

Kelli and Maria,

In order to expedite the process, could you please fill out the attached template, providing the information requested. 

Please call with any questions.

Thanks for your help.

Attached is an e:mail that I forwarded to Jeff Speirs, a bankruptcy attorney with Andrews and Kurth who will be assisting with the mechanics of rejecting the out of the money transportation agreements that you all have identified.  I imagine that we will need full company names, contact persons and addresses in order to place the different pipes on notice of the motion to reject.  Could you please coordinate the gathering of this information so that we will be in a position to act on it as soon as possible after New Years?  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts

Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

I've been trying to reach you all day but am not surprised I haven't been
able to reach you.  I understand that Enron is offering netting agreements
to its counterparties.  Con Edison Energy would like to get a copy of such

"Collateral Issues","Debbie and Tanya:
I thought it might be helpful to summarize how certain of the collateral provisions in our trading agreements are impacted by the filing of bankruptcy:

1.	ISDA Credit Support Annex - Paragraph 4 provides that our counterparties do not have to post or release collateral to us if either an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition has occurred or if an Early Termination Date has been designated for which an unsatisfied payment obligation exists.  In addition, as you are aware, we can no longer hold cash or LC's, and as we discussed, since this language technically applies to LC's as well, it might be worth it to appoint a QI to hold our LC's for us.

2.	Industrial Master - same as above except that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash.

3.	Annex B - the Event of Default/Early Termination Date conditions only apply to requests to reduce collateral, not to a demand to post collateral.  There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.


4.	EEI Master (without new collateral annex attached)- no conditions precedent in the EEI to posting or releasing collateral.  There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.  The new collateral annex works like the ISDA Credit Support Annex except  that the limitation on holding collateral only applies to cash


5.	Enfolio Master Purchase and Sale Agreement -  no conditions precedent in the Enfolio to posting or releasing collateral.  There is no QI requirement for holding collateral.

Hope this helps.  Call me if you have any questions.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Pete,

Attached please find my comments and suggested revisions for the Master
Netting Agreement with Enron.  I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same
comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the
provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with
someone from Enron or someone in our shop.

For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes
focused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we
should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for
example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron
Energy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we
may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and
Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an
exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect
at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks.

Ernie

	Payment through Wed - 11/14 (with interest) = $14,153,688.78
	Payment through Thur - 11/15 (with interest) = $14,155,586.71

The Settlement Agreement is written based on a Wed payment - if they want to argue for another $1,100 in interest, then we can send it to them in pennies.

Carol, in regards to our discussion yesterday evening.  I have a customer who wants to roll some of his hedges back a few months.  We are ""out of the money"" on the hedges.  The roll will be done where it does not change our liability.  This is better for ENE because it pushes our liabilities due out into the future by about six months.

Please let me know ASAP.  Thanks for your help.

"Camping/Stuff","Just wanted to check in on you.  We should get together soon. I will try
and swing by some time after work this week- are you still working late?
I have some leads on camping if you still think that is a good idea.
Debbie sent me the following information. There are websites for them
also, but I have not checked.   I don't know much about Cleveland, Texas
although the fact that is close must mean it can't be that pretty (close
is likely better, however, given that we will only have the weekend).

The last time we went camping we stayed at Chain O'Lakes in  Cleveland.
They have all different kinds of cabins (very fancy to very  rustic),
horses, hayrides and only an hour away.  The number is  281-592-2150.

We also stay at Neal's Lodges in Concan which is about 4 hours away.
The cabins are not as fancy -- horses, hayrides, pool, cheap.  The
number  is 830-232-6118.

They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.

You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/ equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

finalizing our list as well.  We also obviously need clean up some cosmetic

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting?    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed  a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale  provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys.,  Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d  1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two  prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,  Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998).    In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings  and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention  is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff  test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case that a software invention was ready  for patenting when one of the inventors verbally described the invention  to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it,  even though the actual software used to practice the invention  did not exist before the on-sale bar date.    The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature  of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates  the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect  high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with  software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales  materials that could describe details of software inventions must  now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under  ?102(b).

"RE: 2002 IT Budgets","Mark - Louise Kitchen put your name down as the sponsor for all EA IT legal projects.  All EA IT projects were reviewed & approved Tues. & Wed. by the sponsors except the 2 that had your name by them.   Cornelio and I tried to catch you Tues. & Wed. via phone calls & emails to review them with you, but with no luck. Louise is reviewing the final EA IT budget today.

I apologize for you being put into the middle of all this by Louise, but I wanted to give you all the information that I could about the projects before Louise reviews them today.  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	RE: 2002 IT Budgets

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

I'm out of the office at a meeting right now so I will get back to you on
that.

As for the employee meeting, if it is onlu available ""real-time"" it would be
considered an oral communication and would not need to be filed -- even if
you could call in.  However, if a video, audio or transcriptt is made
available after the presentation -- including on the website -- then it
would need to be filed.

Also, I emailed to Lance this morning a draft of some guidelines for which
type of communications would need to be filed.  I will forward it to you
also when I get back to the office.  I hope this is helpful.

"RE: NOPR on reporting requirements -- please comment","Thanks Susan.  I think that we can readily distinguish the competitive nature of the deal information requested here (including book outs and when we entered the transaction) with the transparent data that we want the one (regional) grid operator/RTO to provide in real time, including MCP, transmission outages, etc..  I agree that we should examine our avenues for opposing parts of this.   I think Elizabeth has asked Sam Behrens to help Enron on this.  

Also, when is this data required to be posted?  I don't think that our traders use the current quarterly filings of competitors for much data, other than the bottom line amount sold for ranking the power marketers.  Therefore, our typical argument that we can absorb info better than competitors (even when we have to show ours), may not be applicable here (Susan, you may want to check with Kevin and Tim on that).

Subject:	NOPR on reporting requirements -- please comment
Importance:	High

As described in my August 22 e-mail, FERC has issued a NOPR proposing revised public utility filing requirements.  A copy of my Aug. 22 summary is attached for your reference.  I've discussed this with Elizabeth Sager and Harlan Murphy in ENA Legal, and the following is a very brief summary of aspects of the NOPR that we think Enron should consider opposing.  Comments are due Oct. 5.

If approved, FERC's proposed revisions would affect Enron by requiring electronic posting of certain transactional data by power marketers and entities selling at wholesale pursuant to market-based rate authority.

Currently, EPMI (and gencos with market-based rate authority) must file the following information quarterly:

	- identification of the buyer/seller;
	- description of the service, (e.g., purchase/sale, firm/non-firm); 
	- delivery point(s); 
	- price(s) (price per transaction rather than price ranges) 
	- quantities, (e.g., MWh/MW); and 
	- dates/duration of service (e.g., daily, monthly, hourly, etc.) 
Such information is supposed to be reported on a transaction by transaction (rather than aggregated) basis.  The quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment.
The quarterly filing requirements proposed in the NOPR differ in that they would, 1) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt; 2) require electronic posting of an Index of Customers rather than paper filing and 3) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs.  Enron should consider objecting to these revisions.  I've spoken with some of the traders and they agree.  The effect of these requirements would be that Enron's competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction.  FERC has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements.  
ENA Legal representatives and I will be participating in the EPSA conference call to discuss the NOPR on Friday.  I would like to have a consensus on Enron's general position by then.  I do not know whether we will be joining EPSA's comments or filing on our own.  Please let me know your thoughts and call me if you would like to discuss.  Also, if you don't already have information on the EPSA conference call and want to participate, let me know and I can provide you with the call-in number and agenda.

Maybe email is the best way to talk!!! I actually do most of my communicating this way anyway! I went to yoga last Wednesday night AND Saturday afternoon. While I enjoyed the Wednesday class, I hated the Saturday class. It was a younger crowd and there were too many people. I will continue to go to the Wednesday class but never again on the Saturday one. However, I like your idea of going on Sundays and I would not like to get stuck with just one instructor. You are welcome to come on Wednesdays too, it is 1 1/2 blocks away from my house at 6:30.

"Master Netting Agreement","All, attached is a redline of Master Netting Agreement against the previous Cook c draft and the proposed Collateral Annex.  Please review and provide your comments to me by first thing Tuesday morning.

Major issues for resolution:

1.  We have determined that we should file on cash collateral in Canada.  Peter Keohane is reviewing the forms and processes for such, including how to determine and establish priority with respect to same.  Peter will coordinate with Credit concerning the mechanics of accomplishing the filings.

2.  Due to the continued concern by some counsel in respect of mutuality issues for setoff and netted settlement (another form of setoff) ""aggregate liability clauses"" set forth in 3a and 3b have been included for our consideration.  We must come to a consensus as to whether this language/concept should/must be included.  If the answer is yes, is the language included the best tactic?

3.  Mary Perkins is reviewing LC matters with banks to be sure the modified format set forth in this draft is satisfactory.

Timing Objective:  Our objective is to provide everyone another draft on Tuesday and finalize on Wednesday.  This will require a conference call sometime Monday afternoon.  Carol, Rick, David, Peter and Elizabeth please provide Esmeralda Gonzalez, my assistant, at 713 345-7621 with your Monday afternoon availability and she will set a time and advise you.


   
For those of you who had a prior draft of the Collateral Annex, I could not get this redlined for some reason, I apologize.  

Carol, since I am out Friday will you please call Cadwalader and be sure they received this.  Further, will you ask them to review the NY choice of law provision in light of Canada cash collateral issue.  Thank you.

David and Rick, in your review please give special attention to the calculation mechanisms utilized for the determination of the Collateral Requirement.

Esmeralda, after you have determined availability, please send email to Carol, Elizabeth, Rick Antonoff, David Mitchell and Peter Keohane advising of the time (Houston time).  We will call other parties and do not need a call in number.

"December 6 Meeting Time & Scope","
Recipients

Noel Trask inquired when is the December 6 meeting supposed to start and
end and whether we ask business people familiar with the MISO rules to also
attend -- maybe allow each company to
bring one person if they want to?

I think it is important that we all agree how to proceed so, please advise
how all of you would like to proceed.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

SuperModels 
Why Enron investors are running for the exits 
It's all about risk -- and the Houston energy company may be on the hook for billions. Bailing now and taking $5 a share, sellers reason, is better than getting only pennies in bankruptcy. 
By Jon D. Markman <http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/bios.asp> 

In normal circumstances, shares of Houston energy-trading titan Enron should have stabilized around $10 after it agreed to a merger with crosstown rival Dynegy earlier this month. Instead, the stock price is retreating faster than the Taliban. Why? 

The answer, like everything associated with Enron, is complex. But the short version is that investors fear that hidden problems will scotch the merger and force Enron to seek bankruptcy protection, potentially leaving its shares worth pennies.

While attention has so far focused on credit problems related to ill-disclosed limited partnerships, institutional investors are increasingly worried about risks Enron faces in the market for financial derivatives known as ""swaps."" Accentuating their concern: Billions of dollars' worth of Enron's near-term swap contracts -- instruments that ironically were invented to help corporations limit risk -- will reportedly mature next month and are even more hidden from investors' view than the deals that have gotten the firm into trouble so far. On Wednesday afternoon, the bond-rating agency Fitch updated its opinion on Enron by stating it believed ""there have been significant cash collateral calls from wholesale trading customers well in excess of previous expectations."" 

Glenn Reynolds, chief executive of independent debt-research firm CreditSights and a former chief credit officer at Lehman Bros., said the swaps market is a very large but arcane investment arena that isn't followed by mainstream corporate bond analysts or equity analysts. Yet, he noted, ""it's one of the biggest things that can still go badly wrong for Enron.""

How much is Enron on the hook for?
Swaps exposure thus makes December a make-or-break month for the company, as its counterparties in complex deals glued together with billions in borrowed funds frantically attempt to unwind positions in markets as disparate as currency, natural gas, bonds and metals. If Enron either made the wrong bets on too many of these deals, or contract covenants are breached that spur demands for hard-asset or cash collateral, the company could be forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy court to prevent a run on its dwindling treasury.

Moreover, because the world of swaps and derivatives is so incestuous -- with Company A able to pay its hundreds of millions in derivatives obligations to Company B only after it receives payments from Company C - some traders worry that Enron's potential inability to pay off on its swaps liabilities could threaten the stability of the world's commodity-trading system. 

No one is saying that this worst-case scenario is bound to happen. But rumors of default risk can spread like financial smallpox in nervous markets -- even if they're never proved true. One story making the rounds on trading floors, for instance, tied the historic collapse of U.S. government bonds in the third week of November to the belief that Enron had to sell vast quantities of short-term Treasury notes to make good on swap-related margin calls. (Enron officials did not return calls for comment.)

Experts noted that Enron's counterparty risks and scant disclosure on high levels of borrowing remind them of the spectacular blowup of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, which imperiled the world capital markets until the Federal Reserve captained a bailout. That debacle ended when once-generous banks and brokerages finally turned off the money spigot. Said one veteran portfolio manager, who asked not to be identified: ""This is shaping up to be LTCM 2. If Enron's lines of credit dry up, they're out of business -- end of story.""

Lots of credit and lots of deals
To understand the problem more clearly it's important to understand what Enron does for a living, and the role and utility of swaps. 

Many investors think of Enron as an energy company or gas utility, but it has really operated more like a combination investment bank, market maker and hedge fund in the past few years. One of the key ways it earned income was its role in selling risk-management instruments -- those swaps -- as a solution for whatever financial impairments that a company fretted over. 

Let's say you run the risk-management operation of a metal-mining firm and you're long copper futures as a hedge against the possibility that prices might fall in six months. You want to lock in the price, so you enter into a swap with Enron under rules of the International Swap Dealers Agreement, or ISDA. Accounting protocols allow you to keep this trade off your balance sheet, so it's not disclosed anywhere for competitors, or investors, to monitor. One of Enron's roles was to find a company with the opposite problem to yours -- let's say they want to be short copper futures -- and make the match. Thus Enron helped you swap a risk that made you uncomfortable for a risk that you felt you could control. 

More often, Enron reportedly took the swap itself and laid off the risk by using some other hedge, such as being long or short Eurodollars or U.S. Treasury notes. It might also find it profitable to be the one responsible for actually delivering the physical product. At its peak, Enron is said to have been a counterparty on thousands of swaps per week.

This business requires massive amounts of credit -- also known as ""leverage"" -- because margins are slim; the only way to become super-successful is to do really big volume. It turned out that few of Long-Term Credit Management's counterparties or bank lenders understood that the hedge fund had leveraged itself by as much as 30:1 because of similar efforts to trade in high volume. And likewise, one veteran analyst who asked not to be identified told me that he believes Enron might have been leveraged by as much as an astronomical 100:1 in some cases.

Thomas Seims, chief economist at the Federal Reserve in Dallas and an authority on swaps, told me that the crux of the issue is, ""Do we know exactly what their positions are -- and did they use swaps and leverage properly or improperly? When we find out, we can determine the potential for a contagion effect."" 

The big question: How many deals?
Why don't we know what their positions are? Legally, they're not required to reveal them -- and we already know that Enron has done an absolutely terrible job of disclosing information that securities laws and investment community conventions actually require. Swaps are similar to the proprietary trading operation of major brokerages, but with one critical difference. Typically stocks are fairly liquid and transaction terms do not vary much. But swap contracts can have all sorts of covenants related to the creditworthiness of the counterparties. So for all anyone outside of Houston knows, there could be any number of billion-dollar deals hanging out there with rules that require Enron to put up collateral or pay off loans if their debt rating falls below a certain rating threshold, such as BBB-, one step above junk. The surprise disclosure of such a clause in a previously hidden limited partnership contract over a Brazilian deal is what caused Enron's stock to plunge 20% on Tuesday, according to traders. 

More importantly, one financial services executive pointed out, because Enron owns the market for many swaps, spread options and other thinly traded financial instruments, they're the ones who set the mark-to-market price that shows on their profit-and-loss statement. For example, every night an Enron trader must mark the value of a 15-year Chicago natural-gas swap on his books. There is no closing or settlement price -- there's only what the Enron trader thinks the price should be. It is in these mark-to-market prices of thousands of swap positions that Enron could theoretically hide hundreds of millions in unrealized losses, if it chose to. 

One prominent New York consultant to the energy risk-management industry told me he's estimated that Enron could be forced to write off as much $1 billion or more in failures related to its swap transactions. Why hasn't anyone focused on it? ""The magnitude of Enron's partnership problems is so great that after awhile you get numb, and no one is paying attention to this part of their operation.""

Philip K. Verleger Jr., a leading energy-industry economist and consultant, also noted that one reason that Enron risks aren't easily quantified is that they ""may not be price independent."" That's an economist's way of pointing out that the company -- a major player in a corner of the derivatives business called ""delta hedging"" -- may not have the capital required to maintain a futures position in all the puts or calls it sold to commodity producers trying to offset risks that the price of things like natural gas or oil might fall or rise sharply. If prices maintain above or below a level that Enron forecast as likely to make it money in such a transaction, no problem. But if prices in the commodity change unexpectedly -- as oil prices did earlier this month -- then Enron could find itself deep in the hole and forced to lean on thinning lines of credit to pay its obligation.

Whirlwind merger deal no reassurance
Verleger isn't mollified by the notion that Dynegy, which agreed to merge with Enron, has studied the company's trading book thoroughly and decided it was fine. ""Dynegy probably was not able to see its whole book in a week,"" he said. Added another trader, who declined to be identified: ""How anyone could do such fast due diligence is beyond me completely."" Another trader speculated that auditors at Dynegy -- a much smaller firm -- may have initially given Enron a free pass on some disclosures because it was considered one of the cleverest and best-connected companies in the nation, with a chief executive who was a major financial backer and friend of President George W. Bush.

Reynolds, the CreditSights executive, said that investors should beware what he calls ""omission risk"" -- or the simple fact that ""what you don't see is what gets you every time."" He points out, for instance, that Enron had a chance to tell investors about its ratings-related exposure in the Brazilian deal during a conference call with investors last week, but didn't. ""It boggles the mind"" that they have kicked away every opportunity to rebuild confidence and credibility, he said.

So what if gremlins pop out of the swaps closet? Reynolds believes that Dynegy will use broadly written escape clauses in its merger agreement to walk away from its Enron merger if unexpected swap defaults -- called ""fails"" in the business -- emerge. He believes that Enron would then find it necessary to seek the protection of bankruptcy court, because no other merger partner or bank is likely to follow in Dynegy's footsteps to the altar.

In that event, Reynolds estimates Enron's stock -- which traded for $85 a year ago -- could quickly sink to less than $2 from its current perch in the mid-single digits. Since holders of more than 80 bonds and senior bank loans would stand ahead of shareholders in bankruptcy proceedings, however, he speculated that Enron shareholders would be lucky to end up with pennies.

Subject: RE: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings


Shari, 
I'm not sure of what to do about the informal, irregularity of the WSPP process.  I agree with you that there seems to be a lack of basic due process going on, but, it has always been difficult to understand how and why they do things the way they do.  History and personality seem to explain it best. 

 Right near the end of the Thursday session, I believe it was Jeremy Weinstein of PacifiCorp, tried to focus Mike on what to me seems to be a crucial, and potentially fruitful question:  Is the WSPP becoming more and more like the EEI, and if so, does anybody care?  Mike seemed to feel that there was a vast difference between the two agreements and that this vast difference mattered a lot.  I think if anybody would take the time to dispassionately examine the steady stream of changes that have been made to the WSPP over the past couple of years, the result would be that the two agreements would be seen to be converging rather than diverging. I would even take a further step and argue that the convergence has been so steady and effective, that the time has now arrived for a Joint EEI/WSPP Drafting Committee to harmonize the agreements. However, I think my suggestion is still premature.  At this moment in the process, it would seem that a comparative document, painstakingly showing each amendment of the WSPP agreement and what it looked like in comparison to the EEI needs to be created.  If convergence is what this objective study shows, then, at some point, the question fairly becomes:  why not get it over with and merge the documents?  Is a Joint Drafting Committee a good idea?

I may be wrong, and an academic look at my thesis is certainly required,  but my instinct is that Mike's notion that a group-adopted agreement is fundamentally different than multiple bilateral agreements is a classic distinction without a difference.  Why does how the agreement is derived matter if the two agreements are becoming inexorably more and more alike? Why should I fly up and down the west coast attending a steady stream of meetings and pay $25K a year to use one agreement when it is steadily becoming more and more like the other agreement which involves neither inconvenience?  The creeping imitation of the WSPP process needs to be recognized for what it is.
I would argue that this approach might bear more fruit than wrangling over process, although, that too is probably going to be an enduring necessity. ----cgy

Subject: FW: Summary of WSPP Nov 1 and 2 meetings


I don't know who has had time to read the latest WSPP email  - but the
provision below was NOT adopted in accordance with std. procedure. At
the Contracting Committee meeting in Colorado Springs on Aug. 10- this
provision did not get the requisite percentage to pass on to the
Operating Committee (in the meeting summary, he noted that it got a
""supermajority"" - whatever that is.)  At the Operating Committee meeting
in Idaho, Mike Small again proposed this change but said that there did
not need to be a vote since it was going to be part of the ""operating
procedures"". Now it appears that he has ""snuck"" it into the WSPP
Agreement and took advantage of the fact that many did not attend the
meeting in San Diego in reliance on being able to attend via conference
call. As we all know, Mike Small arbitrarily canceled the call that
would have allowed us to participate in the Executive Committee meeting.
I suspect he did so because he knew we would object to this clause and
therefore the 90% would not have been achieved. 

Any thoughts on what to do about this??

S      

_________________________________________________________


A new Section 32.5 to limit changes to the WSPP Agreement that may be
made automatically through the confirmation process after the five day
was adopted.  Under this new provision, non-standard confirmation
provisions (e.g. changes to the basic terms of the WSPP Agreement) may
be adopted only if there is explicit agreement to those changes and not
by operation of the five day rule.  The modification adopted at the
Executive Committee was to limit the oral agreements allowing such
modifications to transactions of less than one week.  This provision as
modified was adopted with only one dissenting vote.

CONFIDENTIAL

Here are some thoughts and comments on Sections 5 and 7 of the Merger Agreement and the  Disclosure Statement.  For ease I have spoken with Mark Taylor and tried to incorporate his thoughts as well.  I have a meeting that will tie me up for awhile but will reread sections one more time and email if I have  any further comments. Call me to discuss whenever you want.  Office 713 853 6349; Cell 713 854 5747.  Thanks

1.  Section 5.6(a) Disclosure Statement - in certain case (unusual contracts may permit termination right upon a change in control) can we add the following words at the end of Section 5.6(a)  ---- ""and/or the contract may be terminated."" 

2.  Section 5.6(b) Disclosure Statement - NYMEX, European exchanges, US/Canadian power pools will need to be notified and credit requirements may change as a result. I would proposes adding at end of sentence  ---    ""(e.g., NYMEX, NEPOOL, state retail licensing authorities).  Additional or substitute credit support may be required to be provided by Gipper and/or its Subsidiaries as a result of such notifications.""

3.  Section 5.8  Disclosure Statement- Additional threatened litigation on power side includes PG&E (termination of transactions), New Power (posting of collateral as well as possible shareholder claims), VEPCO (contractual obligations under power contract), NRG (existence of financial trade).  I'm assuming Richard has decided against adding these but we should check. I have a call into him now.

4. Section 5.9 Absence of Changes, Merger Agreement - Section 5.9(iv) states that Ee compensation has been in ordinary course since Dec 2000.  Without knowing for sure, I thought allot of new agreements/arrangements were made. This may need to be checked. 

5. Section 7.1(a) Conduct of Business, Merger Agreement - Section only talks about introducing new products.  Should we include the right to stop providing products and services, either in there entirety or only in certain geographical areas as well.    (Business mix is frequently changing particularly I think at EES)(Also do we have the right to stop offering by way of example, steel products, without their approval?).  Should we also include the right to expand geographically the marketing of existing/new products (eg new Canadian markets may open up in next several months - Enron's trading activities there may be construed as new products in a new market).  

Finally, as a result of Enron's credit situation, we are doing transactions that are not ""ordinary course"" - we are being asked to help CP's reduce exposures through various means including netting arrangements, ring trades with third parties, assignments, posting collateral based on adequate assurance.  Can we qualify ""ordinary course"" by adding ""taking into consideration credit concerns of our trading partners."" 

6. Section 7.1(i), MA - Prohibition on sales of assets - would this include contractual assets?  We are doing assignment transactions w/ trading CP's whereby  we terminate and assign trades in order to reduce exposures for our CP's.  

7. Section 7.1(n), MA -No Liens - We are entering into Mater Netting Agreements to alleviate CP credit concerns.  Each Master Netting Agreement is a grant of a security interest in all receivables (including termination payments) under the designated trading contracts.  CPs,  if alert, will file UCCs to perfect. We will perfect ours.

8. Section 7.1(q), MA VAR Limits - Again should we expressly state that we can operate at lower limits? Should we define new products as being old products offered in new geographical regions?

"Report from the field","
Depending on who you ask, the EEI evangelism campaign to Seattle  was either a failure or a success.  If you ask Stewart, he will say in his clipped, highly focussed manner that it failed.  Seattle did not agree to convert to the EEI and immediately sign a completed Cover Sheet right there on the spot.   Far from it.  If you ask me,  I think I pulled off a major political coup and have a vote for consolidation in my firm grip.  I didn't even try to convince Paula Green, a bureaucrat who has dealt with Seattle power policy matters for over twenty years and who is very  much ""set"" in her ways in a subliminal manner that is perfectly consistent with her title:  ""Deputy Superintendent,"" to come to the EEI Jesus.   Somewhere on the long dark drive up the  I-5 corridor, with rancid coffee sloshing around with a stale maple bar from a seedy gas station store in my empty, weak belly, somewhere up there by the Centralia coal fired power plant that Transalta bought a couple of years ago amidst all that due diligence frenzy that Greg Wolfe had stirred up within our shop,  somewhere up there in the dark, miserable windy rain I settled upon my strategy.  I would not even attempt a frontal attack.  We have sent the equivalent of John Bell Hood and his corp of Texans directly against the WSPP fortification (the Shari Stack gambit) and been badly mauled and hurled back.  Secondly, Enron, or whatever is left of us, is in no position to claim the high moral ground.  We have to get used to slinking around sheepishly in front of there conservative folks who had suspected our hubris all along.  It wasn't a good time to argue from the implicit basis of superior intelligence.  

Therefore, I decided to test drive my consolidation theory, and, had a spectacular success.  I had this intransigent, stubborn old policy gal leaning over the table, looking into my eyes and emphatically exclaiming:  ""I support that.  Who could possibly be against that?""  This after I basically said that lawyers could tie us all up for years arguing about an ever narrowing set of distinctions and that it was time to stop bashing either agreement and set up a Joint Drafting Committee and ""harmonize"" them.  Excuse me for using this nauseating word ""harmonize.""  It's right up there with ""facilitate""  or the dreaded ""incentivize"" as disguting words, but I swallowed my pride and used it with gusto.  I laid it on real thick, claiming that the WSPP had done a great job in the west while the same thing was going on in the east and now it was time to harmonize the documents and get on with more important matters, that it was stupid to tie up our valuable resources and time comparing these agreements and trashing them.  I claimed that each agreement referred to exactly the same concepts, only using different words, and that these differences could be quickly resolved by competent energy attorneys.  

My test drive of this theory with a live candidate, an entrenched WSPP supporter who aint gonna change was interesting.  I got her to agree to a joint committee concept and state emphatically in front of all that she would enthusiastically endorse this idea.  This is the first of several of these types of conversations we need to have with various parties.  I am going to head over to BPA and ""convert"" the infamous Brenda whoever to this new doctrine.  If we line up big guys like Seattle, BPA and others, critical big Mo may be generated and, in the ultimate scene, we send Elizabeth into the caves (drafting conference room) against Mike bin Small and, hey, I'm willing to bet on the outcome of that encounter.  I think we all know what would happen then.  Think about it.  It is a marginal little drama that I have kindled up out of the depths of my despair and boredom, but, it might just pick up steam if it is nursed along.  PacifiCorp's Jeremy Weinstein is taking a more strident, judicial review of due process approach to the WSPP, and with him leading a formal charge, this little argument I am trying to plant could be the compromise for peace.  ----cgy

"Upcoming EEI Contract Activities","
To All:
 
The following was decided at the conference call on  October 3:
 
(1) The participants asked that the organization plan   reflect that the Drafting Committee performs the executive function and heavy  lifting for the EEI Contract Working Group.  The Drafting  Committee will be redesignated the Executive Committee and the Working  Group called the Membership Group.  New members of the Drafting  Committee will be appointed by the Co-Chairs and ratified by the Membership  Group.  I've attached a revised  organizational plan to reflect these  and other points raised during the conference call.
 
(2)  The Drafting Committee should meeting sometime  during the first two weeks of November.  Both AEP and Jones Day  have offered to host the meeting in Columbus, Ohio.  The dates under  consideration are 11/6,11/7, 11/8, 11/13, 11/14, or 11/15.  The Drafting  Committee would give final approval for the optional provisions and collateral  annex before they are posted on the EEI website.  In addition, the Drafting  Committee would discuss the future organization of the contract group and a  proposal for non-EEI members to contribute membership fees.
 
(3) Subject to any objection by those not on the call, Noel  Trask of the Exelon Power Team will be permitted to join the Drafting  Committee.
 
Finally for those who do not know yet, I will be taking a  position with Constellation Power Source effective November 5.     At this time it is not clear who will be the EEI point of contact for the Master  Contract group.  EEI, however,  is committed to continued sponsorship  of the agreement and related activities.   It is unclear what role I  will have with the group's activities as a Constellation employee.  I've  thoroughly enjoyed working with you over the past three years and hope to stay  in contact with all of you.

As we move to send out letters to the counterparties where we have rights to call collateral and we have not, we need to recognize that if they provide us with LCs instead we need to try and implement the assignment language which will allow Joe to finance them.

Blvd. between 1:15 and 1:30 up to 11th and back down.  Please join us to
cheer the Flame Relay and show Houston and the world that we are truly
the Heartbeat of America.  Wear or bring something patriotic. The
Olympic Flame Relay won't be back in the U.S. for at  least another
decade. Please join us to welcome the Olympic Flame to Houston.

Don't miss the HHA General Meeting this Monday, December 10, 7:00 P.M.
at the Fire Station. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee will be attending
to make a very exciting presentation on behalf of the Heights Boulevard
Reforestation & Beautification Project. It will be followed with a brief

update on project funding and construction timeline.  Councilman Gabriel

Vasquez will then provide us with a comprehensive update on what's
happening in the neighborhood i.e. street paving, townhouse development
and more.  The homeowners from the Holiday Home Tour will be recognized
followed by festivities and a delicious cookie swap...

What:     Holiday Cookie Swap
When:     Monday, December 10th
Time:     Approximately 8:15 (After the HHA's General Meeting)
Where:    HHA's firestation, bottom floor

Please bring your favorite homemade holiday cookies, at least 5 dozen,
to
swap out in person with other Betty Crockers.  (The more dozen you
bring,
the more you can swap.)  Please have each dozen in a zip-lock type bag.
If you would like, enclose a copy of the recipe in each bag.  A cookie
swap is a great
way to have a wide assortment of wonderful holiday cookies to be used
for
for guests, place in a goodie bag for the mailman, 'Santa's snack', etc.

That's all the announcements from us (the HHA) for awhile!  Thanks.
Debbie the webmaster

Attached is a resume for Emma Caplan, who is the wife of one of our Human Resources Directors. Emma spent three months working with Michelle Cash and I have spoken with Michelle who speaks very highly of Emma. In addition, with her contract management experience at Compaq I am sure she will be able to provide the coordination and contract support that we are looking for in the Legal Credit Team.
	
I have spoken with Emma today who is interested in the position.
	
By copy of this email to Linda and Alice I shall be grateful if they will arrange for a time, ideally early morning or late afternoon, for Liz/Lisa to interview Emma and tell me and Molly Magee (Human Resources) when that will be. Please could you arrange it that Emma comes in for an hour and sees Liz and Lisa.

It is important that this happen within the next two weeks.

"RE: From Bloomberg","I am sorely tempted to venture into remarks that would be unbecoming of the professional ethics I am sworn to uphold.  This is like being in the Oregon State penitentiary and finding out the prisoner down the cell block is a child molester.  The regular inmates have ways of dealing with this particular kind of specie. Every morning,  our whole reason for walking into the building that houses the business establishment we toil for  is about not letting our business hubris get out of legal and ethical control, and now, we see this.  One of our own crossed the line, a line that seems so dark and vivid now, but which, in the back rooms full of   illusions of omnipotence, and what one's imagination is constrained to not crystalize as the image of literal dope smoking,  seemed to be such an insignificant little technicality.  This is a dark and wretched day for our profession. ---cgy

The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for November 19, 2001 is  -2.

Dark murmurings about the 10Q filing made back east late today  drove the index into the negative realm,  and the swarming of the largest flock of crows seen since the current crisis began had a kind of prophetic impetus:  ""there will probably be much activity tomorrow,""  the dancing, frenetic, catapulting birds seemed to say.

According to Mary, we do not have a written agreement with B of A. Notwithstanding that, from time to time B of A sends out standard Ts and Cs regarding corporate accounts. The last one available, effective October 2001, contains a setoff provision. This purports to allow the bank a right of setoff, either before or after an event of default, and to apply both to the bank, and its affiliates. [It does not purport to apply to the debtor or any of its affiliates, except in circumstances not applicable here -- such as sole proprietor, or partnership situations.]

"RE: Material Contract Review -- ASAP","Nora:
 
My first thoughts are to review the Solar Noncompetition Agreement (noncompete regarding the manufacture of photovoltaic cells in connection with the sale of Enron's 50% interest in the Amoco/Enron Solar Partnership to BP Amoco), the NewPower Noncompetition Agreement and the ServiceCo Noncompetition Agreement (EES new facility services venture).  My recollection is that the NewPower Noncompete and the ServiceCo Noncompete allow defeasance of the noncompetition provisions by permitting the investors to have put rights at fair market value (in other words, the noncompete provisions will bind a successor unless the investor honors the put rights).  It has been some time since I reviewed the Solar Noncompete, but I believe it could bind a successor if a third party merged or consolidated with Enron Corp., as opposed to a stock or asset purchase.  I also need to check the expiry date of this agreement, as it may be close to expiration.
 
Regards,
Robert

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

Thanks, NJD

"Auctions Process","Elizabeth,

I assume that there must be some publically available documents which describe the auction process and the structure of compliant bids.

I would like to obtain a copy of such documents, as they may provide some insight into what the deal structure might look like and help us to prepare NETCoOnline for as quick a relaunch as possible.

Do you know where I might obtain copies of such documents?

(""AEPESI""). Gas and power receivables financing notifications were made to Ephross et al, Cash et al. this afternoon.  Execution of Master Netting Agr. must be preceded by AEP and EPMI's execution of an amendment (""Amendment"") to power master agreements instituting margining solely as to EPMI, which Amendment is resolved except for the $ figure to be placed on the collateral threshhold. Elizabeth Sager on standby to take this to completion if execution is to take place this evening.

"Re: Collateral Annex","
Hi Carol - It was good to hear from you. I have heard that they are keeping
you pretty busy over there with Broadband and Power! With regard to
Reliant's comments:

Mid-Calculation language: Our comment/thought on this was made because we
did not recall that this concept was  ever approved by the Working Group.

Current Mark-to-Market Value: I withdraw my comment. I have thought about
it further and it is not relevant here.

LC Evergreen language: I guess I would say that most of the time, the form
LC we send to counterparties has this language in since it makes sense if
the parties are going to have an ongoing trading relationship. I think that
the Enron form has evergreen language too.  It is more of an administrative
hassle if it is not there but I don't have a strong feeling either way
since we can just keep using our own form. I don't recall the discussion on
this point and thus don't know if it was one person objecting or several.

I hope this answers the questions. Thanks for doing all this work.

Sincerely,

Shari

Doe this mean you think we should leave in the other damages e.g a fixed payment of $42,000 if we do not deliver for a scheduled day (the actual payment required to be paid to VEPCO for non-peak day damages is based in total MWH not delivered and is derived from the following formulae: 

(1 - MWH Delivered/MWH Scheduled) times Annual Capacity Payments/365 (this number equals approx $42,000)

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

On the VEPCO contract we also need to consider the damages for failure to deliver scheduled energy.  Yesterday we talked about normal LDs.  This likely will not work if we are basing the VEPCO price on an hourly index since VEPCO's cost of cover would likely be close to hourly prices.

 Under the current contract, if we fail to deliver, EPMI is obligated to pay:

1.  Cost of Cover defined as either (a) (1) actual cost of incremental purchase or generation costs or if VEPCO is unable to make up the delivery obligations, then (2) VEPCO's highest cost source of generation minus (b) offered energy price (hourly index price under new proposal) Section 9.2); plus either

(A)  If VEPCO has designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of annual capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $530,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) (Section 9.3); or 

(B) If VEPCO has not designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of daily capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $42,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) Section 9.5); 

Let's think about what we should propose (eg 150% of index hourly price per hour of non-delivery?)


Thanks

Importance:	High

Everyone,

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP"" (the ""Index""). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

Subject:	AEP Master Netting Agr

Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the AEP Operating Companies (""AEP"") and AEP Energy Services, Inc. (""AEPESI"").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas, physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.

Here's the deal on this one.  This deal is part of the deals assigned to Morgan Stanley.  This index deal has delivery in 2001 (never exercised) and 2002 (may be exercised).  As Sharen indicated in her email, we are reconfirming (confirming to Morgan) all forward parts of the deals assigned.  This confirm was prepared by Steve Wang without benefit of legal review.  We need legal to review this new confirm.  It looks just like the old one but without the 2001 part in it, but there may be language that Steve put in it that could cause heartburn, maybe.  We are just unsure of the language since legal did not prepare the confirm and it is not standard boilerplate confirmation language.

"Burr Oak Veneer...","From: Mark Whitney
TheLaw.net Corporation
Homepage: http://www.thelaw.net
Remove: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     The Bentley Arnage Red Label is a beautiful four door sedan, but it's not for everyone.
http://www.bentleymotors.co.uk/bentley/picture_gallery/bentley_2.jpg
True though it may be that when ordering the Arnage one gets to specify burr walnut, burr oak, bird's eye maple or black lacquer veneer, most would still find the $200K+ sticker price out of reach. Even most of those in a position to do the deal would walk away in the face of a dubious value proposition. After all, burr oak veneer is still veneer.


WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH LEGAL RESEARCH?

     Lawyers from coast-to-coast complain that computer based legal research costs continue to spin out of control. Many, given their firm size, practice area or jurisdiction, simply can no longer justify these onerous annual contracts with West or Lexis. Others have concluded, as one guesses they might with the Bentley, that after peeling back the veneer, these highfalutin compusearchers simply cost more than they are worth.


THEORY vs. REALITY

     As nice as it might be to own a Bentley, it would have been nicer still had they simply provided you with a shiny new Arnage for free while you were in law school, just as our competitors regularly hook law students with free unlimited access, only to yank the needle upon graduation.

     What percentage of attorneys in the real world enjoy unlimited access to WestLaw? Perhaps more to the point, what percentage enjoy unlimited access to those WestLaw resources that their practice truly demands? Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues?

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     --How do you respond to a legal research industry that likes to market primary jurisdiction packages and thumbs its nose at the reality that you practice in a state like Vermont, for example, a jurisdiction that only issues about 100 new published opinions ANNUALLY, and not surprisingly has yet to consider anything remotely resembling your client's situation?

     Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search ALL states and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)


""I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!""

     And there you have our new favorite quote, from a new subscriber leaving a large firm to start her own thing. We have others; lots of them. See, http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

--Enter a statutory cite into the search engine, and pop up cases construing that item, in one mouse click. See, http://www.thelaw.net/statutes.htm

--Have a case citation you need to know more about? Find cases construing that item in one mouse click. Simple.

--Easy to use? Do you know how to operate a browser, shuttle through little windows folders and do electronic case law research? If so, you're on your way to being a guru using TheLaw.net. If you don't know how to perform these tasks, we will teach at no cost.

--PERFORM UNKNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Use Boolean and, or, not, near, within, adjacent, nesting, truncation See, Sample Searches: http://www.thelaw.net/searchdemo/home.htm

--PERFORM KNOWN ITEM SEARCHES: Field search by cite, party, counsel, docket, author, date or panel.  See, http://www.thelaw.net/help/operators.htm


WHAT ABOUT WEST AND LEXIS?

     Pay them only when you have to. Will you still use Lexis or West from time to time? Sure. Probably. But perhaps you will get to the point where you use them on the web with your credit card, when you can't otherwise get the answer faster, cheaper elsewhere. Or maybe you like that West or Lexis Primary Jurisdiction Plan that you've been using all these years and you think TheLaw.net can provide a sort of meter insurance for those occasions where the circumstances call for a national look.

           This is a reminder to Mitch that he is going to draft some
language for our ""going forward"" transactions dealing with anticipated
changes to ""into"" obligations.  GO MITCH GO!

           I met with our traders today and I am sure of only one thing --
it's a mess.  Mitch - if you're not ready to draft, we should maybe just
set up a conference call next week to discuss.  If so, can we do it
Monday, 11/19 between  2 p.m. and 3 p.m. (Houston time)?

I received the margin letter this morning via Fax.  However, it is backdated to Nov 19th for my phone call with Richard Ott at NIMO.  We have 5 days to deliver (some flexibility to view it as 5 business days).  The margin call is for $4,283,512.  It is to cover NIMO for settlement and imbalance risk for EES participation in their ""Supplier Select"" program.

Subject:	NIMO/Notice RE: Posting of Additional Security

	Molly:

	Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's ""Supplier Select"" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted ""as financial evaluations dictate"". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as ""BBB"" from S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii) the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2.  

	In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an ""A"" bond rating; (iii) a security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least ""BBB"" by S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

	Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional information.

	MLC

The pluses and minuses came out flat, however, two crows flying directly at the building, facing an immediate decision as to whether to fly up or down to avoid collision, at the very last moment turned down.

"Transition of Into Product To MISO","

Recipients:
I also have been meeting with AEP's Into Product traders to discuss the
implications of moving to the MISO.  Conceptually what we have been
discussing is a ""policy statement"" of the ""Best Practices"" for allocating
the rights, obligations and commercial risk as between Sellers and Buyers
of existing Into Product transactions based on the current definition
contained in the EEI contract in as much the same manner under an RTO
structure as possible.  Separately from that transition product issue, but
somewhat related, is a need to define on a going-forward basis the products
sold within these emerging RTO structures on the first day of operation and
as a market rules emerge.  I will endeavor to email a draft proposal Monday
morning to this group.

I am NOT available to participate in a conference call from 2-3 PM Central
time (3-4 PM Eastern Time) on Monday.  I could do 4-5 PM Central  (5-6 PM
Eastern) on Monday.  If that is agreeable, I will set up the conference
call in number and pass code.  Please let me know.

           This is a reminder to Mitch that he is going to draft some
language for our ""going forward"" transactions dealing with anticipated
changes to ""into"" obligations.  GO MITCH GO!

           I met with our traders today and I am sure of only one thing --
it's a mess.  Mitch - if you're not ready to draft, we should maybe just
set up a conference call next week to discuss.  If so, can we do it
Monday, 11/19 between  2 p.m. and 3 p.m. (Houston time)?

"From the ENE/DYG Q&A on Enron's website","Whoever wrote question number four clearly has a sense of humor. 

Will any Enron executives have a role in the combined company's senior management team?
Yes, Greg Whalley will serve as Executive Vice President and will join Dynegy's Office of the Chairman when the transaction closes.
What happens to Ken Lay?
Ken Lay will remain as Chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. He will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.
Will Enron complete its new building?
Yes.
Is Enron's vision still to be the world's leading company?
Enron's vision will be revisited once the companies are merged.
Will this affect Enron's innovation?
A key strength of Enron and Dynegy has been their employees' innovation and we expect this to continue.

"Protect Your Most Important Investment with Deed Restrictions","Deed Restrictions are the best tool that the property owners in the
Houston Heights have to curb over-development and the encroachment of
commercial businesses.  A signed deed restriction document protects the
investment you have made in your property by restricting undesirable
development.  These restrictions do not restrict you from painting your
house any color you like, putting up fences, adding garage apartments,
or remodeling your property in any way.  Once signed, a deed restriction
applies only to the specified property to which it applies and is an
effective tool ensuring future protection, despite changes in future
ownership.  More important, even if your entire block is not deed
restricted, the existence of deed restricted properties within a block
can often benefit the entire neighborhood by limiting developers'
choices in future construction on not only that specific lot, but also
adjacent properties.

The Houston Heights Association (""HHA"") is not a homeowners association.
The HHA is prohibited from assessing maintenance fees and cannot put a
lien against your home.  Why?  As a volunteer-based 501(c)(3) charitable
organization, the HHA is dependent upon volunteers to donate time and
effort to maintain community assets and services that improve our
quality of life; these include Donovan Park, Marmion Park, the Fire
Station at 12th and Yale and the esplanade of Heights Boulevard.
Volunteers coordinate all the fundraisers for these properties and the
projects that the HHA supports.  HHA's four biggest fundraisers are the
Spring Home Tour, the Fun Run, the Heights Festival and the Holiday Home
Tour.  Monies raised by these fundraisers go right back into your
Houston Heights Neighborhood.

The Deed Restriction effort initially started when concerned residents
saw their property values plummet in the late 1970's. Volunteers crafted
a document that would enable our neighborhood to slow down and/or
prevent commercial development.  Large businesses were moving in and
depleting the historical housing stock by destroying the houses or
turning the houses into businesses that were not desirable for the
neighborhood.  With Houston's absence of zoning, deed restrictions in
the Houston Heights were their only method of preventing commercial
encroachment.  While the restrictions spurned businesses that invited
18-wheel truck traffic, unsightly dumpsters that were emptied at early
morning hours, and the use of paved front yards as parking lots, the
restrictions did allow small businesses and arts and crafts enthusiasts
to co-exist with the neighborhood. Currently there are approximately
1,034 Heights properties protected by deed restrictions and HHA
volunteers make themselves available to answer questions and attend deed
restriction signups and other Civic Association meetings to talk about
the positive results of deed restricting a neighborhood.

The HHA recently revised the restrictions to protect the neighborhood
from dense townhouse construction and encourage preservation of some of
the few remaining larger lots in the Houston Heights.  By early 2002 the
revised restrictions will be voted on by those properties that are
currently restricted.  Their passage is vitally important to encourage
development that suits the character of the Houston Heights.  Their need
is immediate and severe.  In the fall of 2001, Perry Homes purchased
large tracts of land on the West Side of Heights Boulevard.  Its plan is
to build townhouses rather than single-family homes.  Representatives
from the HHA have thus far unsuccessfully met with Perry Homes to
encourage them to build period-style single-wall constructed homes.  The
passage of amended deed restrictions and their ongoing wide spread
adoption is the most significant tool our neighborhood has to stop over
development and the mass construction of townhouses.

For more information please phone 713-861-4002, mailbox 1 or visit the
website at www.houstonheights.org.

There were those times, during the War, when fighters on one side of the line would gain personal knowledge of the presence of old friends, even relatives, being directly across the lines, back there in the mass of enemey troops.  The Union General Hancock had been a very close friend of the Confederate General Armsted and on the eve of the final day at Gettysburg,  had a moment or two remembering their good old days together in California.  Wolfe and Krebs are out there somewhere ""on the other side.""  Although I must candidly confess that officer Krebs does not rank high in my humble judgement and is not among the significant players in the combat,  Wolfe does.  Wolfe was a player.  He is out there somewhere on the otherside, talking to ""them"" and not to ""us"" at night, and this causes me the pain of sorely missing a guy I spent many an hour beside in the trenches.  I miss Greg.  I hope I don't have to go head to head with him,  but, if duty calls.....----cgy

Each of Great Bay, El Paso Electric and LG&E Power have issued LC's to us that have has a drawing condition the fact that they have failed to provide alternate security and less than 20 days are left before expiration.  Another drawing condition is that a ""default"" has occurred under the EEI.

The LG&E and the Great Bay EEI master have a default that occurs if a party fails to establish, maintain, extend or increase Performance Assurance when required pursuant to the Agreement.  The definition of Letter of Credit in each Master does NOT have language to the effect that it has to be acceptable to us.

In the El Paso Master the default is based  on a party's failure to meet the collateral requirements in Article 8.  In that Master, the LC must be acceptable to us.


Do you think that we can argue that the failure to renew the LC is a ""default"" that would permit us to terminate and draw?

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"RE: waiver","the amount of maturing CP between now and 12/13 is greater than $55mm.

also, note that the section on debt repayment does not have the same language about ""after 11/21"" that exists in the lien provision -- query whether this would then relate back to the execution date -- 11/12? I think that this should be after the date of execution.

note also, that the definition of Indebtedness picks up guarantees, and that repayment of debt of a non-principal subsidiary relieves ENE on the guaranty, so it is probably picked up too--should specifically carve out.

Attached is a draft termination letter for the respective Master Agreements, including the ISDA. The assignment documentation in respect of the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, Master Purchase & Sale Agreement and the Master Energy Purchase & Sale Agreement does not address the notice address, however the Master Netting Agreement is clear in that if there are any inconsistencies notice shall be effective if given in accordance with the Master Netting Agreement.
	
The termination of the Underlying Agreements is based upon a failure to provide Collateral.
	
Also attached is a draft termination letter in respect of the Qualified Scheduling Entity Services Agreement, which provides that either party can terminate on provision of 60 days prior written notice delivered during the first 180 days commencing June 1, 2001.

"RE: VEPCO","The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.  
I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.

Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.

Subject:	VEPCO
Importance:	High

Kevin and Elizabeth,

Attached is a proposal summarizing our restructuring talks with VEPCO last week.  We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They'd requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.

Discussion summary:
Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).
Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.
VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).
Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index
Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany
Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary
Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01

"American Heart Walk","Friends:

This Saturday, November 3, I am participating in the American Heart Walk, a 5k and 10k walk that raises money for the American Heart Association.  I am sure that all of you are very familiar with the fine work of this organization, but if you are not, here is its website:  http://www.americanheart.org/.  Moreover, most of you are likely familiar with my particular interest in heart related charities.

I am looking for sponsors and would be very grateful if you could make a donation.  Please let know as soon as possible if you can help, since I would like to collect most of the donations prior to Saturday.  Also, for you Enron types, don't forget about the Matching Gift Fund.

Thank you very much for your support.

Jim Grace

"FW: Material Contract Review -- ASAP","We have heard from many of you regarding the attached request.  This e-mail lets you know suggested recipients to date.  It also confirms that (i) the current goal is to ascertain whether a change of ownership of either Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp. will cause contract breaches, defaults or terminations resulting in material liabilities and (ii) the timetable is as soon as possible.  Preliminary responses early this week (subject to further review as necessary) would be most helpful.

Thanks again, NJD

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"RE: Middle Market Group","I agree we may need to circle the wagons, but I cannot see why the five (5) Origination lawyers in Portland cannot handle this change.  They took our secretary, what more do they want?

It's late, but here are a few initial thoughts:

1.  If they can't get the work done with five lawyers, adding a Christian Yoder or Steve Hall to the mix won't save the day.  (Okay, maybe it would, but I won't tell them that.)  

2.  Our traders need both of us to get the work done and to continue our great run of profitability.  Why change something that is working so well?  

3.  I joined Enron to work with Christian and to report to Elizabeth.

My position on work allocation is as follows:

If the proposed project was something I would have done for Paul, Stewart, or John before they joined Orig, e.g., WAPA/BPA deal; EEI Master Contract; or a structured commodity deal, I would be happy to help in any way that I can add value.  But if the project is an asset-driven transaction---e.g., something like Longview or LV Cogen, then I think that the Orig lawyers need to take that work.

Hope all is well.  This is a follow up email to the phone message I left you
this morning.

Please see the attached email from Enron's Kimberly Indelicato.  From the
information I have received it appears that this issue has reared its head
because we have asked Enron to sign our EEI confirmation when EKT is the
Seller.  I have looked through our executed EEI and I find no amendment,
addition, deletion, etc.... to Article 2, Transaction Terms and Conditions,
Section 2.3 Confirmation.  EKT believes that it is in compliance with
Section 2.3.  Specifically ...""Seller may confirm a Transaction by
forwarding to Buyer by facsimile within three (3) Business Days after the
Transaction is entered into a confirmation (""Confirmation"") substantially in
the form of Exhibit A.""

EKT believes it has complied with the requirements of Section 2.3.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

"Enron Master Netting Agreements","
Attached are clean and redline versions of the ""without margining"" master netting agreement.  The redline is   
just for your review to discern the changes.  
I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow.
Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

Michael,

If you are not the proper person to receive this request will you please
forward it to the proper person within your organization.

We have recently made significant changes to our credit policy and we have
requested all customers be compliant with the credit policy by December 15
of this year.  I have attached a copy of the credit policy reflecting these
changes for your review.

After reviewing your company's last 24 calendar months of activity it would
appear that we will need a letter of credit in the amount of at least
$100,000 for you to be compliant with the terms of the policy.  Approved
language for the letter of credit is at the end of the credit policy as
attachment 2.  The issuing bank must also be acceptable to SPP and these
requirements can be located in the financial security section of the policy
under Letter of Credit.  Also, we have mailed and emailed the policy with a
request to send back the credit agreement.  I have also attached a copy of
this agreement.  If you would have it signed and sent back as well it would
be greatly appreciated.

 <<Form-SPPCreditPolicy2CS111401.doc>>  <<SPPCreditAgreement110101.doc>>

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,

Mar.  31, 2001 expiration language is currently in Section 17, should this be shifted to shorter, 3 mo. timeframe? .  No CSA is contemplated to be put in place under this arrangement.  Even simply for completing execution of this document, in addition to enforcability questions, it seems preferable to leave European entities off, if possible.   --David

Attached is a spreadsheet that includes information about EPMI's transmission/pool/etc. agreements.  (use the ""TRANSMISSION"" spreadsheet).  Please use the current EPMI contracts listed as an example of the contracts that may be needed for NEWCO.  To start, please work on the areas listed below and email your updated spreadsheet to me.  ""General..."" should include any specific issues, such as AA rated company not required to provide any collateral, etc. (or parental guaranty needed, etc.) or contract must be approved by a regional committee, etc.  Include in ""timing"" column the estimated amount of time from request to completion of agreement and start of service:

Steve Walton and Alan Comnes -- West

According to M.P.E.P. Section 608.01, Examiners must now review applications to make sure that hyperlinks and other forms of browser-executable code are not included in the text of the application, unless the hyperlink or browser-executable code is part of the applicant's invention and therefore must be included in the application in order to comply with 35 U.S.C. Section 112 (and as long as the applicant does notintend to have the link be active). The end result is that Examiners will (or at least should) now require any such unnecessary hyperlinks or browser-executable code to be deleted from patent applications. Further, and perhaps more importantly, M.P.E.P. Section 608.01(p) now prohibits incorporation of subject matter by reference to a hyperlink or browser-executable code. The PTO's rationale for this rule of practice is that they don't want patents or applicat! ions on their web site including links to commercial sites that they don't control. (As for links that are part of the applicant's invention, the PTO will disable the links before posting the text on their web site.).   One way to work within this new rule of practice may be to rephrase any such link or code in a way that a computer won't detect as a hyperlink or browser-executable code, but that a reader will understand sufficiently to be able to refer to the referenced site. For instance, in a hyperlink that is normally phrased as http:// followed by a URL address, consider inserting a space between the ""http:"" and the ""//"". Only time and further experience will tell if this workaround will work.

                                        A New Call to Arms 
Take all American women who are within five years of menopause -
train us for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades,
gas masks, moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned
tuna -
drop us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan,
and let us do what comes naturally. 
Think about it. Our anger quotient alone, even  when doing standard stuff
like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make even
armed men in turbans tremble.  We've had our children, we would gladly
suffer or
die to protect them and their future. We'd like to get away from our
husbands, if they haven't left already. And for those of us who are single,
the
prospect of finding a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as 
being struck by lightning. 
We have nothing to lose. We've survived the water diet, the protein diet,
the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across
America and never lost a pound. 
We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of Afghanistan with no
food at all!
We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware
stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no
problem. 
Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?
Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and
extended families at Thanksgiving dinners for years...we understand tribal
warfare. 
Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is for
how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.  We
know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or without
the government's help! 
Let us go and fight. The Taliban hates women. Imagine their terror as we
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain. 
I'm going to write my Congresswoman. You should,
too!

"short term PPA template","Dear Elizabeth;

As per Mark Haedicke's request, please be kind enought to provide me with the short term PPA template that Enron uses in North America and Canada.  Mark asked me to compare the US/Canada and the Brazilian versions for clients who do not have a good credit history and, as consequence, will not enter into a Master Power Trading Agreement type of document.

I have already I think ""burned my bridges"" with both Tanya and Debbie although I am not entirely sure about what I did to make them act the way they are.  It may be better if you and/or Elizabeth meet with Bill and talk generally about how he wants credit issues to be handled and maybe he can shed some light on what is going on.

Subject:	Credit issues

Lisa and Liz;
I am very concerned about the way that credit is handling and coordinating with us on margin issues.  For over a week we have been waiting for them to compile and send to us information on LC's that are due to expire at the end of December.  We finally received a very cryptic spreadsheet this afternoon which requires alot of follow up in order for us to determine what our rights are.  I get the sense that credit assumes that since we are in bankruptcy we will never have the right to draw on LC's that we are holding when in fact we know that this is not necessarily true.  For example, this afternoon I found out that we are holding an $8 million LC for trades done with Enserco under an ISDA.  The drawing condition is a failure to pay.  Under the ISDA, they were required to renew this LC within 20 Business days of the expiry date which is 12/31.  If they don't renew I'm hoping that we can declare an Event of Default, terminate, request payment of a termination payment and if they don't pay draw.  I'm not sure that by following all of the cure periods in the ISDA we can be in a position to draw on the 31st.  That's just one example.  Do you have any thoughts on this?

re 2nd point, they are changing to officer only. if we know, we will tell them.
we went round and round on this and that is compromise. if we don't know and they don't they can't cure and we wouldn't call a default anyway.
re your first point, can you call elizabeth guffy re this and see if we have captured the receivables/inventory we need???? thanks

On the General Security Agreement, are we confident in Section 2 (a) that the reference to ""sale of goods"" that electricity is captured as a ""good""?

In Section 13 (a) (iii) time should not start to run from when an executive officer receives knowledge thereof. We should not be put in the position of uncertainty as to when time begins to run. This is an important issue and the monitoring and reporting within NP should accord it the appropriate importance.
	
In respect of your point 3. below, are acquisitions a real risk/opportunity for NP? In any event I feel we need to be careful about exercising corporate control over NP and should mirror their current corporate governance requirements, rather than impose new requirements. What do you think?

1. the defn of eligible accounts: UNBILLED-20%, NEW POWER BILLED-80%, UTILITY BILLED-30%
also, the 61 days goes from invoice date.
2. the collateral defn which includes general intangibles and proceeds will stay same.
3. re acquisitions-no change to the way they can approve now re acquisition process, so 70% comes out. (robert-i did talk to bill and michael about and they are ok with as is b and b).
4. amend 7(c) of master agreement to say that they have to provide covenant compliance cert. which says whether or not they have a MAC--right now ways that they have to say they have no MAC. this amendment should survive the replacement collateral period and be for all time. that way they have to tell us only one way or the other and the MAC does not cause an independent default in 2(a) of the master. this is how we think should have worked to begin with consistent with our other masters.
5. keep negative pledge.
6. severance cap: say that no executive deferred compensation or ""parachutes"" or similar will be paid during the period with our released cash or any other cash unless we are fully margined with cash and they have released the a/r and inventory. they can pay ""pay as you go severance"" during the period (i.e. no lump sum/ and limited to what the person would have received in monthly salary ordinarily).  they can also pay any other severance stuff (i.e. $ under employment contract )capped at $500,000.
david and elizabeth will turn the docs from last night with some other nits etc. fixed up for last internal look before we send. robert see if we haven't gotten what you have if you would so can keep going.
shout back anyone if disagree with above. have just confirmed this list with michael.

Cc: David Mitchell
Subject: Definitions of Eligible Contract Participant and
EligibleCommercial Entity


     Pursuant to your telephone conversation with David Mitchell, please
find below a description of the definitions of ""eligible contract
participant"" (""ECP"") and ""eligible commercial entity"" (""ECE"") which appear
in Sections 1a(11) and 1a(12), respectively, of the Commodity Exchange Act,
as amended (the ""Act"").  We also have set forth certain additional
representations and warranties which we believe EPMI should consider
requesting from the Mississippi cities with which it will be doing
business.

     Under the Act, with certain exceptions not here relevant, a
municipality is an ECP only if it (i) is an ECE or (ii) owns and invests on
a discretionary basis at least $25,000,000 or more in investments.
Assuming that the Mississippi cities do not have a $25,000,000 investment
portfolio, each will have to qualify as an ECE in order to be an ECP.  In
order for a municipal entity to be an ECE, it must, in connection with its
business, (i) have a demonstrable ability, directly or through separate
contractual arrangements, to make or take delivery of the underlying
commodity; or (ii) incur risk, in addition to price risk, related to the
commodity; or (iii) be a dealer.  Thus, it would be prudent to obtain a
representation from the municipality that it has the demonstrable ability
to make or take delivery of the underlying commodity in the transaction.

     Additional representations that EPMI may want to request of each city
are as follows:

   the city will engage in all Transactions as principal and accordingly,
   the city will determine the appropriateness for it of such Transactions
   and address any legal, tax or accounting considerations applicable to
   it;
   the city is knowledgeable of and experienced in the risks of entering
   into Transactions its engages in, is capable of evaluating the merits
   and risks of Transactions and is able to bear their economic risks;
   the person who is executing this Agreement on the city's behalf is duly
   authorized to sign this Agreement in the city's name;
   no advice furnished to the city by EPMI shall form a primary basis for
   any decision by the city;
   EPMI is not a fiduciary or adviser with respect to the city unless it
   has agreed otherwise in a written agreement under which EPMI receives
   compensation specifically identified as consideration for EPMI acting as
   a fiduciary or adviser;
   any trading recommendations and market or other information communicated
   to the city by EPMI are incidental to the conduct of EPMI's business as
   a dealer and do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
   an offer to buy any product; and/or
   such information provided by EPMI, although based upon information
   obtained from sources believed by EPMI to be reliable, may be
   incomplete, may not be verified, and may be changed without notice to
   the city.

     Please feel free to call David Mitchell (212-504-6285) or, in his
absence, Marissa Morelle (212-504-6150) with any questions.

Danielle,

Thank you for the invitation to discuss scheduling activities for the month of August. As I am sure you are aware this company is undergoing a significant period of turmoil. It would therefore be of great help if you could send a list of specific questions so that we may be able to answer them directly.

If it would aid your understanding of our activity, we have full requirement obligations in both the North and South zones that were to ramp up starting in July. This load was to reach in excess of 100 MW by September. However, the speed of switching and the location of this load were not known. In addition, we have resources off 2 power plants, both located in the South. One of these plants is consistently subjected to various types of command and control dispatch by the ISO and we are obligated to find a market for any residual energy. 

I trust this paints a picture of what we do and can help clarify any questions you may have. At this time, I do not feel we are in a position to comment on the actions of other QSEs as any information we have would be purely anecdotal.

I trust all is well,

Doug Gilbert-Smith

"Drafting tip","Look at California's spin on contract provisions preventing California from seeking FERC review of contract prices.  California officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power.  Rather than protecting suppliers, these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutiny.---sch


THE STATE
Energy Pacts Bar State From Seeking U.S. Review of Prices
Crisis: The provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations. Consumer advocates want the agreements redone.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

October 15 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Buried in the fine print of the long-term contracts California officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the state's right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high.

Critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated.

""You would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances, because it's patently ridiculous,"" said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). ""It demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts."" The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are ""just and reasonable."" If the FERC finds otherwise, it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits.

In recent weeks, Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities Commission, has asked the FERC to review two of the state's long-term power contracts. The prices and terms of those contracts may be ""unjust and unreasonable,"" Lynch said. Neither contract had the no-challenge clause.

But when asked about contracts that include the prohibition, Lynch expressed outrage.

""They didn't want anybody looking over their shoulder,"" she said. ""From my perspective, that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state. . . . If they thought this was a reasonable contract, why wouldn't they want FERC to uphold their deal?""

State's Bargaining Position Was Weak

The companies with no-challenge clauses in their contracts included Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, Dynegy Power Marketing, Sempra Energy Resources, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., Coral Power and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading.

S. David Freeman, the state's chief negotiator on long-term power contracts who was recently named head of the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis.

At the time the contracts were negotiated, the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases.

""Our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in January,"" he said. ""They were asking, 'Is this a serious deal? Is the state of California committed to it?' What are you going to say--no? [Then] you're not going to get a deal.""

The state began a hurried effort to negotiate long-term contracts in January after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights. The costs threatened to bankrupt the state's utilities, which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers.

State officials negotiated dozens of contracts, some lasting as long as 10 years, which offered prices ranging from $58 to $249 per megawatt-hour--a far cry from the $500 per megawatt-hour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time.

But by summer, the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped. California suddenly found itself paying more under the long-term contracts than the $15-to-$30 per megawatt-hour offered on the spot market.

""Look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts. They were pretty much desperate,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

""We were talking about windfall profits, taxes and seizing power plants, and I think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down, which they have.""

Michael J. Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said the clauses provided ""the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say we're willing to invest in California.""

""It's not that we're superseding anything, frankly, it's that we've said we don't want the party we've done the transaction with to try to derail it,"" Niggli said.

He acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review.

""The question becomes, 'Will FERC accept that or consider that?' "" he said. ""And then, 'Do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form?' ""

Bowen and Freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny. ""Frankly, I wasn't too concerned about the clause,"" Freeman said. ""I don't think it's enforceable.""

Enforceable or not, Bowen said, the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek FERC review.

""The very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasn't an evenhanded situation,"" she said. ""I believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances, but that doesn't excuse [officials] from the responsibility of trying to improve the situation now.""

"RE: NEPOOL Financial Assurance","My understanding is that we have posted bonds in excess of $60M and are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy.
EPMI and EES are not relying upon an Enron Corp. guaranty to provide any part of the financial assurance required by NEPOOL. 
	
Suggest we can take one of four courses of action:  (1)   Do nothing;

					    	   (2)    Request and authorize the ISO-NE to disclose to concerned NEPOOL participants the fact that EPMI and EES 						           have posted bonds to ensure compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy and that no part of the    						           financial assurance required is provided by an Enron Corp. guaranty;

					   	   (3)    Send a letter to all NEPOOL participants confirming that EPMI and EES financial assurance obligations are being 						           met solely by the posting of bonds;
				
					               (4)    Combination of both (2) and (3).
	

If there is a perception or a clear understanding that the credit downgrade of Enron Corp. is the reason for a reduction in trading activity with EPMI and/or EES in NEPOOL and that NEPOOL participants will respond favorably if they knew that the financial assurance is provided by way of bonds, not an Enron Corp. guaranty, then option (1) should be discarded.
	
Option (2) may be enough to give the comfort to ""concerned"" participants.
	
Option (3) and (4) will ensure that any letter we send out will make its way into the press, almost as soon as it is sent and if we send any such letter out we need to be prepared to meet any media interest. Further, the publication of any such letter in the press may encourage other counterparties in other forum to demand that EPMI and/or EES post bonds in order to continue trading and could materially adversely affect our trading activities.
	
If we considered that any disclosure would make a material difference to the confidence that NEPOOL participants have in trading with EPMI and/or EES, my recommendation would be to pursue Option (2).

Marcus

Kevin, Rogers, and Dana -- We do not have to do or say anything since, per NEPOOL, Enron is in compliance.  However, if you feel that NEPOOL participants are not trading with us and we need to make some statement, we can (if ok with legal).  Let us know. Thanks.

I got a call today from Ed McKenna, the ISO-NE treasurer.  He is getting a large volume of calls from NEPOOL Participants concerned about Enron Corp's credit rating.  He is telling these Participants that his office only monitors whether NEPOOL members EPMI and EES are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy, which they are, and does not monitor Enron Corp.  Ed suggested that when PG&E experienced difficulties PG&E drafted a short notice, which ISO-NE circulated, explaining how its subsidiaries were not affected by the credit rating of the parent.  The ISO is offering us the same opportunity to draft and circulate something similar if we wish.

What may be going on here is a concern by NEPOOL Participants that we are using a parent guaranty to meet the Financial Assurance Policy.  My recollection, however, is that we have instead posted surety bonds from AA agencies to meet NEPOOL credit requirements.  If we disclosed this to the NEPOOL Participants it might allay their credit concerns.  We may however, not want to disclose this if we are employing parent guarantees elsewhere, lest we be asked to post surety bonds everywhere.  Can you discuss this with the traders and see what they want to do?

"RE: Williams and Dynegy clean assignments to get Enron margin back from Williams","Tracy,

This looks like a good list.  Let me discuss with Elizabeth Sager and when I receive feedback from the team, I will let you know when to contact Williams and Dynegy.

Let's discuss later this morning.

Subject:	Williams and Dynegy clean assignments to get Enron margin back from Williams
Importance:	High

Bill/Ed:

Susan and I went through the dissection process of the Williams AND Dynegy portfolios to find some straight forward assignments that will result in:

-EPMI getting some return of collateral from Williams (Enron is out-of-the-money to Williams on both financial and physical power fronts...therefore being margined overall)
-EPMI to reduce its in-the-money position to Dynegy since Dynegy never posts collateral anyways.

The NET result in the proposed assignments eliminate risk i/a/o $39.4MM so long as Williams accepts $39.4MM of Dynegy risk.

Here's the attachment draft.  Let's discuss how to push this to Williams and Dynegy.

"HHA General Meeting Monday, November 12th","THE PLAN!

The upcoming November 12th general meeting will be a special occasion.
Businesses who share your concern for continually improving our
community
join the Houston Heights Association.  Their dues, sponsorship  and
active
participation help us make our neighborhood the unique and inviting
place
we all enjoy.

Our November meeting will showcase the many area retailers that add
convenience and quality to our daily lives.  The theme of the program is

""Holiday Shopping in the Heights"".  There is a wealth of marvellous
shopping opportunities right here under our noses in the Heights.

As a typical male, shopping is not real high on my list of life's
pleasures. Don't get me wrong.  I love giving gifts.  It just the
""getting
them"" part that I get stuck on.  While cost is a factor, it is not the
biggest issue.  The idea of just zipping right down the street and
picking
a nice gift up does have a great deal of appeal.  Saves gas.  Saves
valuable ""golf"" time.  Gives me a chance to say hello to a few friends.
The big shopping stickler remains ""What to get for who and where?""  What
I
need is ""The Plan""!

Well Happy Holidays! Merchants from the Heights have already done the
all
the leg work for us.  They have put together ""The Plan"".  They have a
shopper's paradise of information that answers many of those age old
questions like:
Where can I shop in the Heights that does gift wrapping too?
What the ""in"" gift to give my 8 year old niece?
What an alternative to giving my significant other yet another kitchen
appliance this year?
What is a nice gift for Granny this year?
Can you give me a map of how to get to the participating stores along
with
their holiday hours?
What merchants offer special Holiday discounts for being an HHA member?
What is the best way to get gifts shipped from the Heights and what are
my
deadlines?
Where are the best places in the Heights to buy Holiday decorations and
what are some new approaches?

As our nation reaffirms it's believes and values this Holiday season,
few
are more important than the strength of our community.  This holiday
season
make a pledge to do your shopping close to home - right here in the
Houston
Heights.  Buy from that business owner that also is your friend,
neighbor
and member of the Houston Heights Association.

See you at the fire station starting at 7 PM on Monday November 12th.
Then
see you just down the street at that unique Houston Heights shop buying
that one of a kind gift for that special someone.  - Mike Easley

"National Bank of Canada","We received from NBC a notice of default dated Thursday Nov. 22.  The letter makes reference to our failure to deliver margin, and states that in accordance with the ISDA, our Threshold is now zero due to the potential event of default. I believe our two day cure period will be over today (Friday and today serving as the two day cure period).  Do we need to reply to this letter or just sit tight and wait for the Termination Letter? I think this will actually be the first contract that will be terminated as the ability to post an LC, and therby cure the default, is not available. I am willing to try to have one more conversation with their credit manager Bill Bonnell although it is doubtful that it will help.  Please advise.

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving ""unit contingent"" power versus ""interruptible"" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

"Revision to Master Netting Forms","
As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical ""(including automatic termination, if applicable)"" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included.

    

Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

Attached is a redline of the Master Netting Agreement.  We are narrowing it
to limit it to being a set off agreement.  In this way we can avoid having
to go through the threshold issues and collateral management issues, which
in light of the fact we don't have a Collateral Annex are not
insignificant.  Please review it and call me with you comments.  We are
continuing our review and may have additional changes.  In addition, we are
complying a list of the AEP companies which will need to be included.(See

"FW: Tax-exempt financing","Read Pat Boylston's e-mail for a more complete explanation, but, the bottom line is that borrowing solely to post collateral is a risky deal for the bond-holders, because it is unclear how the IRS would treat this transaction.  On the other hand, PGB suggests that a tax-exempt pre-pay for power is do-able if, and it's a big ""if,"" you can get bond counsel to sign off on a legal opinion blessing the transaction.---sch

Subject: RE: Tax-exempt financing


Something is in the air.  This is my third pre-pay question today.

Very complicated subject because it falls into a gray area where the IRS
has not been very comfortable creating bright lines because of a
perception of the potential for abuse.  Reason for IRS fear, probably
justified, is that one very central and primary theme of regulation in
this area is to prevent a municipal entity borrowing at ""subsidized""
tax-exempt rates and investing the money (in whatever form of investment
you can think of) in something producing a higher return.  Yes, the
classic ""arbitrage"" play.

Concern has been that by pre-paying municipality was, in effect, making
an investment in the physical energy asset and there would be some form
of return, real or expected, which needed to be tested to see if it
violated the regulations rule governing permissable investment return on
tax-exempt funds.

Despite that, IRS did issue a ruling based on facts out of Alabama in
the early-mid 1990s which sanctioned an electrict energy and capacity
pre-pay deal.  Facts were pretty tight.  They included, either expressly
or by pretty clear implication, that the energy and capacity were solely
for the use of the pre-paying entity.  Also, the deal was set up for
business reasons independent of the fact that the pre-pay money could be
borrowed at tax-exempt rates.  (There are also other factors cited which
one would need to work through if a real deal is being proposed.)

In the late 1990s the area became very problematic because of a series
of very large natural gas pre-pay deals which came to market.  This are
still being debated and are technically still under IRS review.  Most of
these had a significant element of purchase for resale.  Some also
included the purchase of gas in the ground assets as opposed to the
obligation of an independent third party to deliver as existed in the
Alabama private letter ruling.

Following the IRS's announcement that it was going to review the entire
pre-pay area the blockbuster public pre-pay deals came to a halt.  That
is not to say they are not still doable.  However,the risk profile is
very different than it was five years ago and the ability to get an
approving outside legal opinion may be a significant closing issue.

All that being said, the most ""middle of the road"" deal would be a
pre-pay of a contract to provide electric energy and capacity.  If I
remember correctly, the Alabama ruling also involved some element of
extending an existing relationship rather than being a totally ""new""
contract with a new buyer.  

There is some precedent for munis to bond for large ascertained
financial oblgations, such as the WPPSS participants who issued bonds to
fund the payment of their shares of the liability while awaiting their
insurancers settlement of their claims. I do not think borrowing to
cover margin payment obligations is specifically covered in the IRS
regulations. However, there are several policy/ general principles
reasons that I do not think it would fly.  Same thing for borrowing to
pay SOLELY for loc costs.  Although paying for the LOC portion of a
bricks and mortar transaction is not a problem.  

A number of other issues are also raised which would have to be worked
through.  For example, if the purpose is borrowing to pay for an LOC,
how much do you borrow.  One year's 150 bps fee?  Several years fees?
Do you cash collateralize the LOC, which is just an investment to secure
the LOC and which then has to go through the IRS investment return
regulations (although in fact you can do this if linked to a bricks and
mortar type situation although you are forced by the way the regulations
work to be negative on your investment spread borrowing to investment
return.)

In general, tough but not impossible to put together a pre-pay energy
deal.  Not a happening thing with the financial margin/ LOC
transactions.

Pat,

We have a few quick questions relating to tax-exempt financing.  

1.  Can munis use tax-exempt financing to pre-pay for power?

2.  Can munis use tax-exempt financing to meet financial obligations
relating to power purchases, e.g., use the cash to post margin or pay
for a letter of credit?

Thanks,

Just as an FYI, I have spoken with Marty Jo at Entergy-Koch. I tried to explain to her that we are not disagreeing to sign Entergy-Koch's confirm when they are seller, how we would just like for their confirmation to reflect the example confirmation within the EEI agreement. I also mentioned to her that I had sent their confirmation for review to our attorney David Portz and I expressed the changes that needed to be made to their confirmation to their back office. I have attached the EEI agreement just in case. She mentioned at the very being of our conversation that she would like to discuss the issue with you.

We wanted to provide you information about this upcoming meeting, which
may be of interest to your company.  We would appreciate it if you would
pass this along to the appropriate member of your staff.

EEI will conduct a one-day workshop to focus issues and discuss options
related to the formation of the Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB).
The workshop will take place on Friday, November 9, at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.   The meeting will take
place from  8 a.m. - 4 p.m.  The purpose of the meeting is to gather EEI
member input on EISB formation issues related to both wholesale and retail
electric standards.

As you know, the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) recently expanded its
charter to include the development of electricity standards.  FERC Chairman
Pat Wood has endorsed this action, as well as Commissioner Massey and
Commissioner Brownell.  Business practice standardization issues will be
discussed this week at the FERC RTO workshops, focusing on a potential
regulatory role in defining candidates for standardized business practices.

For hotel accommodations, please contact the hotel directly at 972-453-1234
and ask for the EEI GISB-EISB special room rate of $119/night.

A meeting registration information and response form is attached.  We will

Subject: RE: Draft of Market rate filing


    Marcus -  I'm having this translated into Word and resending. This reflects the market power study done for Sandhills, an Enron affiliate, in March.   (While we have filed more recent applications in cases involving Enron, they were for sales of plants to third parties, and therefore studied the 3rd party's market power, not Enron's).   We haven't found anything more recent, but you would probably know that better than I. 

       We have found several existing Enron affiliates with market rate authority who did not make any sales in the second quarter of 2001.  They might be useful as shells, but I don't know whwther they'd work from an internal corporate perspective.   Those shells are North Carolina Power Holding, West Fork, and two others. 

 Maybe you could make sales through them for a few days.  At that point, I can call FERC staff and see if we're going to get the new entitiy's authority backdated to today.   If we get a good word from staff, we can then start selling from the new entity.  If not, the worst tcase is that we sell from North Carolina Power (etc) under their existing authority for 60 days, and then start selling under the new entity's name.

"RE: MISO Registration","David,

I'm sorry if this wasn't clear.  I actually work with Christi and Susan (they both sit right behind me).  We have looked at all the regulatory issues, and have collected the majority of the necessary data to move forward.  At this point, I am working with Leslie Reeves and Ed Sacks to nail down some of the financial details.  After that, we just need to get Kevin Presto to sign everything and submit the application/registration.

However, before we do so, I assumed and Ed Sacks confirmed that we will need a legal review of those documents.  This does not mean reviewing the industry issues that Christi and Susan might do, but reviewing all the contractual provisions to ensure we are not entering into anything we find unfair, onerous, or contrary to our established procedures for such contracts.  

Again, my apologies for not making this more clear in my letter to Elizabeth..

Elizabeth,

Attached please find some contractual documents related to the Midwest ISO and our ability to take service under their OATT.  I need to have them reviewed as well as get some aid completing them.  I have attempted to complete as much of the documents as possible.

Can you please task someone to look at these as soon as possible?  The MISO is expected to start offering service on November 15.  Unfortunately, they have not given us a lot of lead time on this.  I have already been working with Ed Sacks and Leslie Reeves to deal with credit and billing issues, but now have collected much of the information and need to get the documents reviewed.

Thanks for your help.  One annoying problem with Sections 3-7 - they are in Adobe Acrobat, and can only be edited with Acrobat Writer.  I have tried getting the editable originals from MISO, but have not had a lot of luck.  I just placed another call to them to request them again.

Please call me if you have any questions.

"EEI Agreement and Amendment to Guaranty","Bill and Marcus,

Per your conversation with Mike Pechin this afternoon, attached is our
preferred EEI Cover Sheet (which I have changed slightly since the last
draft, the changes are shown in red-lined format), the form of amendment of
our guaranty in your favor (referenced in the cover sheet), and the service
agreement we need you to sign because of our obligation to file something
with FERC authorizing our sales to you under the new EEI.  Marcus can
explain to you the reason for the latter documents, and I believe he is
agreeable, although I have not heard back from him on the language of the
guaranty amendment -- we had discussed the concepts.

We want to stress that it is very important for us to conclude this ASAP as
drafted, including having the box for credit assurances checked.  The only
alternative we would consider is a voluntary closeout of the forward
positions along with the attached EEI Agreement without the box for credit
assurances checked.

I am out of the office tomorrow morning, but will be back in the afternoon,
but if you can call us tomorrow in the morning, Mike will know how to reach
me.  Mike's number is 610-765-6729.

Thanks, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Subject:	RE: Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable Financing

According to the monthly settlement report for September, PG&E Corporation had a balance of $8,676,000 for physical gas receivables, a concentration limit of $3,340,000 and an excess concentration limit of $5,336,000 -- I assume that the amount reflected in the concentration limit was included in determining ASCC's ownership interest in the pool of receivables, and that the assumption below is incorrect.

Subject:	Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable Financing

I assume, unless I hear from Joel or Tim to the contrary, that none of the PGE Entities receivables were included in the referenced financing, and therefore, the financing does not relate to the master netting agreement between the PGE Entities and various Enron entities.

At this time no further master netting agreements should be implemented without coordination with Ephross on these issues in respect of the inclusion of physical gas contracts.

"Estate of Joan Sager","
Elizabeth: 
Now that the Federal Estate Tax Return has been filed, you should think about making a substantial distribution from the Trust to the individual trust accounts for you and your siblings.  Some funds should be held back in case of an audit of the Return.  I think $100,000 would be a safe number to keep in the account.
I called the Virginia attorney and left a message for him.  I hope he has gotten the Estate opened by now. 
How have you progressed with getting the IRA distributed.  Please give me an update.

I received the margin letter this morning via Fax.  However, it is backdated to Nov 19th for my phone call with Richard Ott at NIMO.  We have 5 days to deliver (some flexibility to view it as 5 business days).  The margin call is for $4,283,512.  It is to cover NIMO for settlement and imbalance risk for EES participation in their ""Supplier Select"" program.

	Molly:

	Per your request, we did a bit of research regarding whether NIMO, pursuant to its gas tariff, can request additional security from us in light of the recent credit downgrades experienced by Enron Corp.

Under NIMO's ""Supplier Select"" program, credit appraisals and security requirements are reviewed by NIMO annually and adjusted ""as financial evaluations dictate"". See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186, Revision 3, effective August 1, 2000.  NIMO may require a supplier to post security for the full amount of the supplier's credit exposure if (i) the supplier or its guarantor is at the minimum rating (listed as ""BBB"" from S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" from Moody's) and is placed on credit watch with negative implications by S&P, Fitch or Moody's or NIMO receives information that the supplier or its guarantor's credit rating could be downgraded below such minimum rating; or (ii) the supplier's status as a billing agent is terminated by another New York utility for failing to render timely bills to customers or to make timely payments to the utility.  If in (i) the supplier's or guarantor's credit rating is not downgraded during the next 60 days, the security requirement will be lifted.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.2.  

	In the event of (i) or (ii) above, the supplier may satisfy its security requirement by providing one of the following forms of security, as mutually agreed by NIMO and the supplier: (i) prepayment or an advance cash deposit which will accumulate interest at the applicable rate per annum approved by the NYPSC; (ii) a stand-by irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond issued by a financial institution with at least an ""A"" bond rating; (iii) a security interest in collateral found to be satisfactory to NIMO; (iv) a guarantee, acceptable to NIMO, by another party with a satisfactory credit rating of at least ""BBB"" by S&P or Fitch or ""Baa2"" by Moody's; (v) payments made by the supplier into a lockbox administered by a third party (which will reduce any security requirements to 50% of what would otherwise be required); or (vi) other mutually agreed means of providing or establishing adequate security.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.4.  For your information, NIMO may only call on the posted security in the following events: (i) after providing 5 day's notice to the supplier whenever the supplier fails to pay NIMO charges when due, unless the supplier makes full payment within the 5-day notice period; or (ii) if supplier files a petition in bankruptcy (or the equivalent, including an involuntary petition against the supplier) or if for any reason the supplier ceases to provide service to its customers under NIMO's Supplier Select program.  See PSC No. 218 - Gas, Leaf No. 186.7.  No prior notice is required under (ii).

	Please call me re:  the above if you have questions/need additional information.

	MLC
