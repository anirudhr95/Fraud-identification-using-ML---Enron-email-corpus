Williams Energy has commented on the form of EOL amendment and there are two issues I need to get your opinion on before responding.  Can you let me know when you have a few minutes to discuss it?

Hi Shari
No problem rescheduling lunch.
I'd be happy to drive out of downtown for EEI (assuming I can go - Grant may be traveling some)
Looking forward to Colorado most but also EEI (and I will be there).
Talk to you soon.

   Dede Russo and I are planning to have a surprise baby shower for Marty
   Jo
   Rogers from Axia at some point during the two-day EEI Working Group
   session
   next week. We will arrange to have cake, balloons and a few presents.
   All
   you participants are invited to the shower and if I have missed sending
   someone on this email - please forward it on to them.

   Regarding presents, I will buy group presents for the baby this weekend.
   You can either contribute to this or do something on your own (p.s. it
   is a

   discreetly
   give me money next week but please let me know if so by email NO LATER
   THAN
   THIS FRIDAY so I can plan accordingly. I would imagine that $10 per

   would be plenty.

   Please call me (713) 207-5233 or Dede (713) 207-5240 if you have any
   questions.

FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW
  
09/24/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday. 
""I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market,"" concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case. 
The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said. 
""Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on,"" Cintron said. 
Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region. 
""The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers,"" the judge said. 
The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case. 
     
At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001. 
In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. 
The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December. 
Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission. 
""Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market,"" Cintron concluded. ""This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner."" 
""Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard,"" Cintron said. 
California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million). 
Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds. 
Cintron was persuaded by the ""ripple"" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds. 
""Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task,"" Cintron said. 
""The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market,"" the judge said. 
""Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale,"" she said. 
The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed. 
In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market. 
While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices. 
Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.

Subject:	FW: Set-Off Language

For our call this afternoon.  This is very helpful.  I ta slo sounds complicated, but I think you will se that absent a perfect world, Robert is suggesting only minor changes to the set-off clause previuosly circulated by Mark for EWS trading contracts.  Roberts has also attached more fully developed provisions for both triangular set-off and for square set-off (which would be applicable under the Master Netting and Collateral Contract) which address the issues of mutuality, privity and consideration in greater detail.

Subject:	Set-Off Language

  Further to our conversations yesterday and today, I attach the following:

1.  Memorandum of Square Set-Off Combinations;
2.  Memorandum of Triangular Set-Off Combinations;
3.  Mandatory Set-Off Language for EWS Trading Contracts -  Revision #1, blacklined to the version forwarded by Mark Haedicke;
4.  Clean copy of attachment 3;
5.  Revised Triangular Set Off Provisions; and
6.  Square Set-Off Provision

This is a very interesting although somewhat complex assignment.  At your request I have reviewed the draft Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts as well as the set-off language in the draft Master Netting Set-Off and Security Agreement with a view to developing terms of set-off that will be enforceable in Canada.  (For the moment, I have considered the laws applicable in Alberta and have received input from my Ontario partner, Kevin McElcheran).

Unlike certain jurisdictions (including, for example, Great Britain), in Canada  a creditor's set-off rights are generally preserved in an insolvency.  Section 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 as amended and section 18.1 of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, S.C. 1985 c. C-36 as amended, both expressly reserve application of the law of set-off in the context of an insolvency to which those acts apply.  Contractual set-off provisions are ordinarily enforceable in an insolvency provided the contract of which the set-off provision is part is itself enforceable (i.e. has all of the elements of an enforceable contract including privity and consideration).

Set-off is a powerful tool in insolvency because it permits a creditor with an otherwise unsecured claim to effectively satisfy that claim on a dollar-for-dollar basis out of amounts the creditor in turn owes to the insolvent company.  This is done at the expense of other unsecured creditors who would otherwise receive the benefit of the debt owed by the setting-off creditor to the insolvent company.

The essence of set-off is mutuality: the setting-off of a claim and cross-claim between the same parties.  The difficulty with the expansive set-off terms sought by Enron is that they would permit ""set-off"" as between Enron and its counterparty of debts owed by or to a third party.  My concern is that such purported ""set-off"" is so different in substance from the common notion of set-off which requires mutuality, as to be set-off in name only.  Without mutuality, I am concerned that a court may not recognize such ""set-off"" of obligations relating to third parties as ""set-off"" within the meaning of Canadian insolvency legislation.  The concern is not only that a court may be reticent to allow receivables owed by third parties to the insolvent state to be used to satisfy the insolvent estate's indebtedness to a creditor.  The court may be view any contractual arrangement that baldly purports to do that as something other than set-off known under the laws of Canada.  I am not, however, aware of any case law on point.

With a view to solving the perceived problem with lack of mutuality, I have incorporated language (referred to in the materials as an ""aggregate liability clause"") to try and ensure that in each instance the claim and cross-claim will be between the same parties.

The first two attachments analyse the various combinations involved in square and triangular set-off.  These memoranda serve as a check list to ensure that the proposed language will cover every possible combination of claim and cross-claim.

Turning now to the Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts (attachment 3), I have the following comments:

1.    I have included wording to clarify that the option to set-off is to be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates.  The reason for this is to avoid the uncertainty associated with multiple parties having the ability to exercise inconsistent set-off options.  We must assume that this set-off provision will be included in separate contracts between a counterparty and various Enron affiliates.  If the counterparty defaults on more than one of these contracts, (or if they contain cross-default provisions,) the Enron affiliate that is a party to each separate contract would be ""X"" under that contract and would have the option to exercise the set-off rights thereunder including the right to set-off against amounts it owes, amounts that are owed to any of its affiliates.  Those affiliates may each in turn be ""X"" under their respective contracts and similarly entitled to exercise set-off rights.  While it is unlikely that Enron and its affiliates would act inconsistently in exercising set-off rights, making it clear that the option to set-off must be exercised jointly by X and its affiliates, minimizes any attack of the set-off provision on the basis of uncertainty associated with the potential for inconsistent exercise of the option to set-off.

2.  With respect to the requirement that the set-off contract must have consideration, I have included an acknowledgement by the parties (including affiliates) that each has received valuable consideration for the covenants involved.  This provision is not a complete answer to the requirement of consideration but is helpful.

3.  Paragraph (B) is included to address the mutuality requirement by including an aggregate liability clause, as discussed above.

4.  In the second paragraph of Mandatory Setoff Language for EWS Trading Contracts, the changes to the sentence including ""limitation to"" have been made to clarify that the set-off provision is without limitation to any other rights which X or its affiliates may have.  I was concerned that the ""without prejudice"" language in the prior draft, would leave it open to the defaulting party to argue that the set-off provision cannot work to its prejudice.

5.  The balance of the revisions are simply drafting changes made in an attempt to improve the clarity and certainty of the terms involved.  In attachment 3 I have attempted to minimize the changes with the result that it is not as clear and certain as it might be.  I have also attached a revised triangular set-off provision (attachment 5) which is clearer, more certain and about one page longer.

Finally, I have included a square set-off provision (attachment 6) which affords Enron (and any non-defaulting counterparty) even better set-off protection.  As discussed, I will include this provision in the Master, Netting Setoff and Security Agreement form.

I would be pleased to discuss the attachments with you at your convenience.

Best Regards

"RE: Mandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contracts","Hi Limor

The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of the DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written agreement of all parties involved.  We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, starting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters together and permit setoff on a square basis.  This undertaking requires a fairly extensive due diligence review.  

Hope this explanation helps.  Call if you want to discuss further.

Subject:	Mandatory Setoff Language for Inclusion in all EWS Trading Contracts


One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights.  This is particularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous commodity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of which may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliated entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual setoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master contracts.

	A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with whom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set forth below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negotiating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff language be added.


MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR 
EWS TRADING CONTRACTS

	(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, the Non-Defaulting Party (""X"") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party (""Y"") by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, ""Owed"" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  	

	Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section ___.

	(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaulting Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

	This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts due and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future payments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular setoff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language has been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. laws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdiction in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be required to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default (e.g. ""Affected Party"" under ISDA).  Finally, when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aware that this language is not intended to override the payment netting terms (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (applicable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff language into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that will need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist all lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutually beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distributed shortly.

	If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-6544 or Elizabeth Sager at 713-853-6349.

Has anyone begun to address the issues surrounding the EEI product definitions and the new rules associated with ""transporting"" power across the new RTO/ISO control areas? Upon discussions with parties involved with the Midwest ISO (""MISO"") when scheduling power through the MISO control area a party will no longer designate an interface but only a source and a sink and the Control Area will determine the best path through its system. How will this affect the obligations of the products as defined under EEI. In particular how will this affect the ""Into"" product definition if the buyer and seller no longer have the ability to select an Interface?

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion
List:


COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

NYISO Customer Relations

    CALIF. DWR AGREES TO FOOT WINDFALL PROFITS TAX FOR SOME
     Some generators that have reached long-term contract deals
with California will not have to pay a windfall profits tax if
it's approved by the legislature, reports Dow Jones Newswires
after an state Senate Energy Committee hearing yesterday.
Instead, the Dept. of Water Resources will foot the bill.
     DWR director Ray Hart told lawmakers: ""In some of our
contracts, in order to preserve economics, we had to assure
(generators) that we were not going to tax them."" Critics said it
didn't make sense since the state would essentially be taxing
itself. One official with Dynegy Inc. said dealing with the DWR
""was like playing poker with a second grader"" since the agency
seemed willing to ""give up a lot"" (Dow Jones Newswires, Jun. 21).

Rather than circulate outdated materials, I really need to add the current EEI Form in place of the old Master Purchase and Sale 

Agreement.   May I impose on you for an electronic version of your current EEI agreement?    Also, do you have a presentation 

discussing the EEI highlights?   If so, would you have an objection if we coupled it with the EEI agreement and made the pair 

available to new employees? 

I'm not under an immediate deadline, so please reply at your convenience.

Elizabeth and Tracy, 

Here are a draft risk memo for this transaction and a set of confirms.  David Mitchell is going to fax a sentence to include in the confirms to deal with the bankruptcy void risk, to me.  I am asking you,  David, by this message, to kindly send the sentence to Elizabeth by e'mail. 

The commercial terms of each trade still need to be put into the confirms.  

Elizabeth thanks very much for helping to get this finished.   ----cgy

Elizabeth,
Hi!  Next month LSI is holding a conference on restructuring in the Southwest (Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico).  I would like to attend.  Would Enron pay for my tuition and travel expenses?  The cost of the seminar is $397. 
The conference is July 19 and 20 (Thursday and Friday).  Christian will be on vacation that week, but he said that he thought it would be fine if I went as long as I was available by cell phone.
Steve



ENERGY RESTRUCTURING IN THE SOUTHWEST

July 19 & 20, 2001
Las Vegas, Nevada
Alexis Park Resort
A B O U T T H E C O N F E R E N C E

""In the wake of California's energy market turbulence during the past summer and the subsequent state of emergency beginning in January 2001, states throughout the Western region are reexamining and, in some cases, reversing their policies regarding restructuring of the electric utility industry. This has resulted in ever changing and frequently confusing laws and policies affecting utilities, energy service providers and customers in Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. This conference will help lay the groundwork for energy professionals from all sectors to better understand current market and regulatory conditions in the Southwest, and the faculty of expert speakers will provide insight as to how evolving policies will shape the markets of the future.""

Program Co-Chairs: Arthur O'Donnell and Fred Schmidt, Esq.

Credits: CA: 14 MCLE credits; NV: application pending. Call about other states

Who Should Attend? Lawyers, producers, public and private distributors, customers, brokers, regulatory agencies and anyone else involved in the area's economic development

Hi Martin

Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US)  Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck.

Elizabeth

A trading counterparty of the Oslo office has rejected receiving an Enron Corp. Guaranty governed by English law and subjected to English jurisdiction on the basis that  judgments rendered by an English court may not be directly or safely enforceable in the U.S. (nor is New York or Texan law/jurisdiction an option in this case).  Perhaps you or your group could give me a quick guidance on the position of U.S. law as to the enforceability of English and foreign (civil law) judgments.  Additionally, I wonder if you've seen an arbitration clause in any Corp. Guaranty or can advise whether such an approach to dispute resolution would be acceptable to Corp. (since it is to this c/p).  Many thanks.

The dealers and some of the customers are ok with an EEI but some important counterparties are anti-EEI.  BPA comes to mind.  Digging in our heels on an EEI-only position might make it difficult to get up and running.  Do you have a view of this?

Elizabeth-  I got the statements you sent me and it looks like the value of some or all of the stock went down in between December and June.  Were any of the securities in the accounts sold or have you just held onto everything?  If its OK with you, I would like to call Louis Alexander at Morgan Stanley and ask him to prepare a formal appraisal of the securities as of December 31 and June 30.  He might be able to do this without charge since the accounts are at Morgan Stanley.  Let me know.

As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349.

Elizabeth,

I have attached the index language we are currently using in confirmation letters.

 

The Megawatt Daily Index language in the above attachment is used for Cinergy and Comed (the delivery points are not listed in the example).

Let me know if you need anything else.

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

Thanks for the email and the first draft.

Elizabeth,

After going over the confirmation process with Kim Theriot and getting a
better understanding of that process, we have reworded
our finding as it relates to the confirmation template.  I think at this
point we agree that allowing read only access to the templates is not
beneficial for both groups.  However, we would recommend that legal at
least periodically review the templates (semi-annually or annually)
to ensure the confirmations are proper.  In addition, as an additional
step, have the deal clearing group attach the approval by legal to those
confirmations that require modifications so that an audit trail exists.
Take a look when you have a chance at the attachment below which has the
revised wording for the finding discussed above and get back to me with any
comments or questions.  Thank you.

Mark

Elizabeth-  I sent you a letter today.  To summarize, I asked Lou Alexander to prepare an evaluation of the accounts at Morgan Stanley.  I did not get the information I needed so I sent the securities off to be valued by a company that will turn it around in 5 days.  Once I have the stock info, I can complete the return- without the expenses unless I get them from you before then.  We can deduct on the return any expenses you paid on behalf of your mother from date of death to present including federal and state income taxes.  Send me a complete list as soon as possible.  We can extend the return and pay an estimated amount of tax with the extension.  I would prefer not to extend the return if possible because it is so close to being complete.
The VA attorney told me that the consents need to be notarized.  I have re-sent them to everyone requesting that signatures be notarized.  I don't know why he couldn't let me know that sooner.

Ugh.  Where were you - things again got ugly on market disruption (brokers or dealers permitted up to 4 each with no requirement of equal numbers). 

 In the meanwhile, credit annex meeting has been established for Nov.1 at the Marriott on Coronado Island.  Talk to you soon.

"Reg out language","Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks

Liz,

Here is the administrative claim order.  Paragraph 2 provides that ""This Order applies only to administrative expense claims pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 503(a) arising from the sale of electric energy or services for PG&E's customers through the California Independent System Operator (the ""ISO"") or from the sale of electric energy or services by the California Department of Water Resources (the ""DWR"") (collectively , ""ISO/DWR Administrative Claims"").  For purposes of this Order, ISO/DWR Administrative Claims shall not include the following: (i) claims arising from ""reliabil,ity must run"" (""RMR"") charges, (ii) claims by the ISO, and (iii) claims by the DWR based solely on power purchased for direct sale to customers of PG&E, and for which the DWR asserts no independent claim against PG&E or PG&E's bankruptcy estate.""

I understand that EPMI sold power to PG&E between April 6, the filing date, and April 9, the date on which EPMI terminated the contract.  Are these considered sales through the ISO?  If they are, we will need to file a separate administrative proof of claim for them by September 20.  If they are not sales through the ISO, the deadline does not apply.

Elizabeth, 

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. 

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

Andy

Perhaps we could clarify the following issues at our next meeting:

*	Is there a difference between credit assurances and performance
assurances?
*	Is a guarantee considered a credit assurance or a performance
assurance?
*	In sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c), I am not sure that a margin call is
clearly defined. I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as
a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this
definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the
amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution.

Your comments would be appreciated.

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Subject: Mandatory Set-Off Language



Elizabeth, please call me to let me know how you want to proceed on this. 

I reviewed with Mary last week the set-of language for the trading forms in light of Robert Anderson's review and suggested revisions.  Mary had reviewed the language with your outside counsel and for reasons, most of which I did not necessarily follow to be honest, they were not agreeable to Robert's suggested revisions (other than the ""without limitation"" language (which I note has now been inserted only in part, and therefore may still problematic, in that it refers to being without limitation to either party's rights, which would include the defaulting party's right to object to the enforceability of the entire set-off provision or to assert some alternate form of set-off arrangement)).  I agreed with Mary that I would again review that matter with Robert.

I have again reviewed the matter with Robert, and he remains concerned with the language as is, since the triangular set-off as proposed without also dealing with the issue of mutuality, which is fundamental to the concept of set-off, results in a contractual agreement (assuming that we get past the privity and consideration issues), to call something ""set-off"" that fundamentally is not set-off.  Robert's concern is that if the issue of mutuality is not addressed the current language could be viewed by a court not as set-off but as an assignment of a third obligation as security, that may be unenforceable for various reasons, including non-perfection.

Robert also makes the following points: 

1.  His suggested revisions already are a compromise from what he believes would be required in a more detailed provision addressing these complex issues;

2.  To the extent that we introduce triangular set-off that may not ultimately be enforceable, we are running the risk of the entire clause not be allowed by the courts, and therefore having no right to set-off;

3.  As drafting points, the ""without limitation"" language still provides the defaulting party with an argument to avoid the entire arrangement, and there is no specified date for the currency conversion;

4.  In terms of the issue of consideration, it is an issue of contract formation, which is fundamental to a contractual right of set-off;

5.  In terms of when the mutuality of the obligations arises, he is agrees that it would be best that it arise form inception, but he thought that would be difficult to sell commercially, and therefore setled on default but prior to elected termination.

In short, Robert's point is that even with his revisions he would have concerns, but without his revisions he has serious concerns around enforceability, and it is difficult for me to simply ignore his advice given both his reasoning and my experience with Robert's advice.

In terms of where to go, I think there are the following solutions: 

1.  We can see this as a Canadian issue, and therefore incorporate Robert's changes in the Canadian forms only - physical and financial;

2.  We can have Robert speak to your outside counsel and see if they can't come to some common ground on more universal language;

3.  We can leave the matter as is for all forms. 

(I am more comfortable with 1 than 3.) 

Why don't you give me a call.  I am sure we all want to move past this and, ackowledginging the risks, simply need to agree on a definitive approach.

Peter.

"Unsigned EES Confirmations","
Vicki

As we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Elizabeth,
    Hello! Sorry I couldn't get back with you last night. I was at a dinner and got home a little too late to call.
    As it turns out, I will be helping with Brownies today also so I'll pick up Anna at car pool. If you'd like me to pick up Ella, just let me know at work before ~2:30 (713 745-0678 or vhuff@mdacc.tmc.edu --  but not this home email address). The carpool number is 349.
    See you at the sit-upon workshop!
Vicki

I received a call this morning from Robert Minkoff.  His company is interested in buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I have not had any involvement in the PCA matter for quite some time, so I told him that I would pass along his name and number to someone who might know whether EPMI has any interest in selling its claim.  His telephone number is 201-968-0001.

Thanks.

Subject:	Re: Draft Responses to FERC Staff


Question1:	In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessment or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  We understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to do business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does an instant credit check before confirming the transaction.
However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What sort of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizing EOL to purchase from Enron?
Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the telephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In addition, Enron's risk management process is required to be approved by the Enron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as a publicly held company.  Enron's risk policies are provided in Enron's publicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies.  This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the Chairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In addition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before they can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group approves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedded within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed through an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty's bid or offer via EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there is no human intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnline does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unless CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such that credit limit is still available.

EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Terms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilateral credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on EnronOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online, should the counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract (for credit or other reasons), the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.

Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However, does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL collect, use or manage data regarding cookies?

It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is.  

EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled.  

Question 3:	Also, why doesn't EOL publish a ""ticker"" of completed trades showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data?  If yes, when?

There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction data from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides customers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online charts for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices.  Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also allows for administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with their own systems.

Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For example, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commence on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day's transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.

Question 4: 	In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Networks flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?

EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depending on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that handles U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australian Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office utilizing a ""bridge"":  a process that is capable of communicating transaction information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potential for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the customer with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office systems at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.  Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and regulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction.

The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through EnronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this notifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty, the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notified by the system at the same time.  

The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a transaction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.  Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does, however, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to our settlement and credit systems.

Question 5:	Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?

EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The transactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases) managing the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the commodity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years post a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is policy across all databases.

In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free, real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13 commodities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes e-commerce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously took place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a proprietary, or ""one-to-many"" trading platform. On a ""one-to-many"" platform, one entity, such as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a ""broker"" type platform).  

EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by the second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both the sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer previously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six months, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices could have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the 'bid and offer prices"" all the time to make more informed decisions.

The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") has enforcement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for potential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulatory authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale.  

The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act (""CEA""), Enron can only trade derivatives with counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Such transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract Participants (""ECPs"")(generally, corporations, partnerships and other entities that meet net worth or asset tests).  

EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is a principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a ""trading facility"" as defined under the CFMA.

Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements, RM01-8-000

ACTION:  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
SUMMARY:  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) recognizes that the filing of individual service agreements and paper copies of quarterly market-based sales of electric energy is no longer the most effective means of meeting the requirements of the Federal Power Act (FPA).  Instead, this data must be collected and made publicly available in a manner which is both easily accessible and useful to the public.  To this end, the Commission proposes that each public utility under the FPA (public utility) would no longer file:  short-term or long-term service agreements for market-based sales of electric energy; service agreements for those generally applicable services, such as point-to-point transmission service, for which the public utility has a standard form of agreement under its tariff; and Quarterly Transaction Reports summarizing its short-term sales and purchases of power at market-based rates.  In lieu of the above listed filings, each public utility would file electronically with the Commission and post on its website an Index of Customers that contains a summary of the contractual terms and conditions in its service agreements for all jurisdictional services (market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission service); and transaction information for its short-term and long-term market-based power sales and cost-based power sales during the most recent calendar quarter.  Under the proposals in this NOPR, to the extent a public utility wishes to avoid filing service agreements for generally applicable services such as cost-based power sales or interconnection agreements, it would revise its tariff to include standard forms of service agreements for those services.  The NOPR also proposes to delete 18 CFR ?2.8, concerning the simplification of public utility rate schedule filings, as no longer necessary.

"RE: Summary of WSPP Contracting Meeting","My typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon Clyde's return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were starting to recap the absurdity when Jeff Skilling suddenly resigned).  But in the meanwhile a preview.

The EEI creep was evident when Mike Small after himself, personally,  taking credit for drafting Enron's market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that Enron originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After hearing the new issues Mike threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language.  Afterwards, I spoke with Mike, sorry Clyde, and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too painful.  What pain.  He said Shari Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so ....  Maybe, at this meeting, Clyde and others can begin the writing of a world of one, a world where Clyde can make yet another name for himself.

Elizabeth, 

More changes, all made as the slouching hound  creeps forward shamelessly, in its perverse sickness,   looking more and more like what they dread the most:  the EEI.  I remember as a kid, there would be things that my older brother would do that I would secretly envy and want to copy, but his scorn kept me from doing it.  But slowly, secretly, over time, I would copy him anyway and at the critical moment of being caught, just act like I had no idea what the hell he was talking about, that I had always done things this way.  This is what is going on with the WSPP.  They shamelessly creep toward being more and more like the EEI, all the while feigning unique identity.  At some point we have to have somebody stand up and advocate merger.  I want to be that person that history calls to make that speech.  I want Clyde Durham to rise from his chair in one of those hideous hotel conference rooms with the sliding panel walls, the brown  carpet, the plastic podium with that hated overhead projector and big white screen,  I want to rise up in that setting in front of all those contract administration nerds and passionately argue for merger!  Please let me move in this direction!  I want it to be on my resume that I was the catalyst for the death of the WSPP by merger.    ----cgy

"RE: term power deal","Hi Chris

1.  We don't have a ""one off form"" for US power trading, but it may be possible to use the US GTCs (3 pages) - this document contemplates multiple trades but is shorter than EEI.  It however does not define INTO products, and in general EEI is much better and longer.  Credit usually insists on using EEI w full blown credit and product definitions.

2. Success always comes at a price - great job winning out the financial vs. physical debate.  (ps you may think the pain is over but ... in the US, meetings continue in August to finalize collateral annex and new products. oh boy).

Hope all is good and Addy is doing well. Tell Tracy Hi and that I've been waiting for a psychological improvement before I call her - at this rate it may never happen so I'll just have to bit the bullet and call her in my never ending foul mood.  See ya all soon I hope.

Elizabeth - Two things:

1.  One of our originators has been talking to a Canadian counterparty that wants to do a one-off term (3 year) purchase and sale transaction ""into Entergy"".  Would they need to put an EEI form in place or is there another document they could use for a one time transaction.  The customer is a pulp, paper and forestry products company.   

2.  We expect to release a form of EEI master in Toronto later this week.  With the warm weather and the 8 month process I have had to not only act as draftsman, but also meeting organizer, communications coordinator, and a number of other roles that have been extremely satisfying.  While I am satisfied that I managed to keep the group from making too many changes to the EEI form I look forward to closure on this project.

Pete,

Attached please find my comments and suggested revisions for the Master
Netting Agreement with Enron.  I have noted in paragraph 6(h) (and the same
comments applies to paragraph 6(i)) that I need further explanation of the
provision itself, and I will be happy to discuss this provision with
someone from Enron or someone in our shop.

For the most part, the agreement looks pretty good.  Most of my changes
focused on the arbitration clause.  Given the nature of this Agreement, we
should be careful to include all of the counterparty agreements (for
example, I added a reference to a GISB in place between DMT and Enron
Energy Services).  If the list of agreements becomes too extensive, then we
may want to consider simply listing all of the various Enron entities and
Dynegy entities by name within the body of the Agreement, and attaching an
exhibit that specifies the Underlying Master Agreements that are in effect
at the time this Netting Agreement is executed.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks.

Ernie

Elizabeth and Steve, 

Suddenly Jeff Dasovich was on my line telling me he was shipping all of the ""released California contracts"" up here for quick legal analysis. My first reaction was:  why does Enron have to analyze them?   He is apparently part of a working committee of some sort that is advising the government.  These are the contracts that Davis has held on to so long, but is now releasing, and which will show that he bought high priced power and locked it in for long terms.  Jeff says he is in a room with a bunch of idiots who know nothing about contracts and they are all asking questions about the ""out clauses.""  He wants us to tell him what the ""out clauses"" are all about.  Enron never signed a long term deal, so I am wondering what, besides a kind of bizarre curiousity, would have us in that room down there trying to help a bunch of hysterical bureaucrats paw through a foot of legal paper.  

We will get the contracts tomorrow morning and haul them along with us on the plane on the trip down, then talk with Jeff from Houston.  ----cgy

"RE: Master Netting, Set-off and Collateral Agreement","I agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of ""the lack of mutuality"" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.

Subject:	Master Netting, Set-off and Collateral Agreement

As you know, we are working on the master netting, set-off and collateral agreement to be used with multiple entities, multiple products and cross-border.  I hope to have our comments on the form by the end of the week.  Hopefully we can then settle on a form and proceed for use with counterparties, such as Engage, etc.

One specific issue, however, is the incorporation of the type of set-off language that has been recently proposed by the Legal Trading Committee and, in particular, the use of ""triangular"" set-off.  The Legal Trading Committee agreed to restrict the set-off rights of the non-defaulting party to ""triangular"" set-off for two reasons:

1.	""rectangular"" set-off would be stretching the privity/enforceability issue where the non-defaulting party's affiliates were not a party to the master agreement; and

2.	""rectangular"" set-off could be stretching commercial acceptability with counterparties.

However, in the structure of a master netting, set-off and collateral agreement, I believe both these issues go away, and I think that ""rectangular"" set-off is in fact consistent with the arrangement.  Firstly, unlike a master trading agreement, under the master netting agreement both the non-defaulting party and the non-defaulting party's affiliates, as well as the defaulting party and the defaulting party's affiliates, all should be parties to the agreement, therefore addressing the privity issue.  Secondly, in terms of commercial acceptability, by definition I believe that the parties are agreeing to an omnibus relationship for setting off positions and collateral requirements across all product lines with all trading affiliates.

Please let me have your thoughts.

Regards,
Peter

Subject: RE: RTO Development and impact to Commercial Transactions


Oscar,
 
This is not a black and white issue.   I have already had several meetings with the desk heads and Elizabeth Sager on this very issue and work has begun.   This is a huge industry issue given the changing RTO landscape and its potential effects on the traditional ""into"" product.
 
Until there is clarity on the RTO market structure and transmission rights, there is simply not language that we can get comfortable with.  Rather than blame the traders and/or legal for transaction difficulty, why not immerse yourself into the MISO and Alliance documents and find potential opportunities.   Learn the difference between LMP and ""into"". What are the congestion areas in the Midwest.   What will the basis markets look like?   What is a basis market?What generation units will benefit from LMP/zonal pricing?   What generation will get hurt by congestion? 
 
With regulatory change lies opportunity for marketing transactions.   The fact of the matter is a 2003-06 Into-Cinergy trade (long or short) contains significant regulatory risk, and to protect Enron's shareholders, we need to price addition premium or don't do the trade at all.
 
On the other hand, getting long at a plant bus-bar in a bullish LMP location and getting short LMP seller's choice would be a good trade.   These are the types of transactions the marketing group should be thinking about.   Take advantage of the changing regulatory landscape, don't use it as a crux.
 
I look forward to discussing with you on Monday morning.

Subject: RTO Development and impact to Commercial Transactions






I am requesting that the Legal Department draft and approve specific language that the Mid-Marketing groups can utilize in proposals and subsequent contracts to address the issue of RTO development and the impact on the risk profiles of our commercial transactions.

As deal flow and longer term deals continue to increase, the issue of RTO development is having a pronounced impact on quantfying the risk the trading desk is willing to assume along with the pricing to be offered on particular transactions.

While it would be imprudent to avoid long term deals with primary terms that extend over the development timeline of the RTO's, we need to immediately begin to address this issue in our proposals and subsequent deal confirmations.

The Mid-Marketing Team would like to have generic language that we can begin using by 8/10/01. 


Thanks 

Oscar

Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m. (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to proceed.  Thanks.  John

Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements, RM01-8-000

ACTION:  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
SUMMARY:  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) recognizes that the filing of individual service agreements and paper copies of quarterly market-based sales of electric energy is no longer the most effective means of meeting the requirements of the Federal Power Act (FPA).  Instead, this data must be collected and made publicly available in a manner which is both easily accessible and useful to the public.  To this end, the Commission proposes that each public utility under the FPA (public utility) would no longer file:  short-term or long-term service agreements for market-based sales of electric energy; service agreements for those generally applicable services, such as point-to-point transmission service, for which the public utility has a standard form of agreement under its tariff; and Quarterly Transaction Reports summarizing its short-term sales and purchases of power at market-based rates.  In lieu of the above listed filings, each public utility would file electronically with the Commission and post on its website an Index of Customers that contains a summary of the contractual terms and conditions in its service agreements for all jurisdictional services (market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and transmission service); and transaction information for its short-term and long-term market-based power sales and cost-based power sales during the most recent calendar quarter.  Under the proposals in this NOPR, to the extent a public utility wishes to avoid filing service agreements for generally applicable services such as cost-based power sales or interconnection agreements, it would revise its tariff to include standard forms of service agreements for those services.  The NOPR also proposes to delete 18 CFR ?2.8, concerning the simplification of public utility rate schedule filings, as no longer necessary.

Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response

Subject: RE: draft of comments on Reporting Requirements NOPR




Answering Susan's question, the EPMI's draft comments on the reporting requirement NOPR are in fact consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill.  As initially drafted, that bill would essentially require FERC to do what it proposes in this NOPR to under its existing discretionary authority.  We have used many of the arguments in the draft comments in our discussions against this aspect of the Bingaman draft.

John, I assume this is consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill but let us know if anything needs to be changed.  

EPMI's comments are due next Friday, October 5.

Subject: Brownies! - Scouting for Food




Hello Brownie Families,

 

Our 1st grade Brownie troop is starting up!   During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!

 

A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.  

Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a ""Scouting for Food"" patch.

 

The specifics are:

Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.

Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026

A parent needs to accompany each  child.

Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764

 

There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.

 

Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.

 

If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

 

FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

 

Troop #12478 Leaders - Claire, Sheryl, Barbara and  Joy

We are still on for 3 at the Houstonian. I have 2 appointments at 4 for
pedicures.  Will either of you be able to make it with me?  If not, I
need to cancel them.  Anyone interested in a late lunch/last minute

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in the Allen Center garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Elizabeth -

Here are the comments from me and Dede. I have given it to our Credit Dept.
and asked for comments but I doubt they will have much to add. Call me if
you have any questions with what we wrote.

With regard to the full-blown WSPP Collateral Annex, Dede and I think it
would be better to get the EEI one in a final form before converting it
over to fit into the WSPP. Otherwise, we could be revising the 2 documents
in parallel.

I am planning to get the short draft WSPP Collateral Annex over to you
today.

Thanks!

Shari

This is HTA...not USTA...so a rating isn't necessary.  So there is nothing to
worry about.  USTA is played in the summer, so you won't have to worry about
having a rating until next year.  Usually, if you play any USTA tournaments,
you will automatically get a rating the following year.  If you're
interested, you should try playing a tournament this year.  Unless you really
try to sand bag your level, they don't care about a rating.

Elizabeth:  I was traveling on Friday, but I exchanged v-mails with some of my compatriots about setting up a call tomorrow with you to discuss the foregoing in the context of your long term power purchase and sale commitments.  Do you still want to try to do something on this front on Monday afternoon?  If so, how does 3:00 p.m. (Eastern)/2:00 p.m. (Central) sound?  In that respect, were you able to touch base with John LLodra?  I think it would be good to have him participate since he has a very good understanding of the NE-ISO/NEPOOL and the proposed CMS.  The other possibility may be someone like Dan Allegretti, who is with EES and is now the Chairman of NEPOOL.  Let me know ho you may wish to proceed.  Thanks.  John

As most of you know Genia will be out of the office for a period of approximately 4 weeks from the 4th October. 

During this period Alice Wright will, in addition to her other responsibilities, be available to assist in the preparation of cover sheets and other aspects of work normally performed by Genia. However, while Alice has spent some time with Genia over the past few weeks gaining an understanding of the preparation of EEI Cover Sheets, this is a new area for her and she will require both our assistance and patience.

During this period, for example, it is likely that the attorneys will, from time to time, need to complete cover sheets using the credit work sheet and I would encourage all of you to spend some time with Genia to make sure that, if required, you will be able to perform this task. There are clearly other agreements which we all ask Genia to prepare and  any such agreements should be prepared by the attorneys until Genia's return.

Joe & Elizabeth,

I received the revised document from Will Frederking, EESI Legal which is attached for your reference.  The only items that have been changed are in Special Conditions:
Second Sentence was divided into four parts (i), (ii) (iii) & (iv)
Ninth line ""or representations"" was added after the words ""any Affidavits""
Sixteenth line ""upon written request from EESI"" was added after the words ""between NYSEG and EPMI, and""

Joe,  my proposal for Contract Price section is to complete with $3.65 / MWh.

Will provide the payments, billing and notices information as soon as I receive from EESI Legal Department representatives.

Let me know what you think.

Hi Elizabeth,

Please find attached a form of a form of retail gas contract and retail electricity contract which we are currently using.  In the retail gas contract, the relevant provisions of the terms and conditions are s.19 Obligations to Third Parties, s.25 Amendments and s.26(c) Termination.

In the retail electricity agreement, the relevant provision is s.25(c).

I hope this helps.

  
If you have any questions or difficulties accessing the documents, please give me a call at (403) 663-2812.

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: Reg out language

Firstly, we had some clauses that were in used pre-Alberta dereg. in wholesale confirms that were intended to give us outs in the event that we were found liable for market interference (which ultimately we were not) under ""Project Stanley"", and also to deal with the fact that there was some threat that market opening may be delayed or that there may be adverse regulatiory interference (such as price caps).  We no longer use these clauses and they were problematic for a number of reasons, including that they were difficult to draft in a way that disguised the issue from our perspective and nonetheless made the transaction ""firm"" and acceptable to our counterparties.

We also have more general reg. out language in our retail contracts, which by their nature are far more unilateral and less negotiated.

Mark Powell can e-mail you all of these clauses.

Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks

Look at California's spin on contract provisions preventing California from seeking FERC review of contract prices.  California officials now argue that such provisions indicate that suppliers had undue bargaining power.  Rather than protecting suppliers, these provisions are having the opposite effect of drawing political and legal scrutiny.---sch


THE STATE
Energy Pacts Bar State From Seeking U.S. Review of Prices
Crisis: The provisions suggest the amount of clout generators had during negotiations. Consumer advocates want the agreements redone.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

October 15 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Buried in the fine print of the long-term contracts California officials signed to buy billions of dollars in electricity are provisions giving up the state's right to seek a federal examination of whether the contract prices are unreasonably high.

Critics of the contracts call those clauses the clearest evidence yet that many of the agreements need to be renegotiated.

""You would never find a provision like that in a contract that was negotiated under normal circumstances, because it's patently ridiculous,"" said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). ""It demonstrates how much clout the generators had in negotiating these contracts."" The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obligated to ensure that wholesale power prices are ""just and reasonable."" If the FERC finds otherwise, it has the authority to order power sellers to refund profits.

In recent weeks, Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities Commission, has asked the FERC to review two of the state's long-term power contracts. The prices and terms of those contracts may be ""unjust and unreasonable,"" Lynch said. Neither contract had the no-challenge clause.

But when asked about contracts that include the prohibition, Lynch expressed outrage.

""They didn't want anybody looking over their shoulder,"" she said. ""From my perspective, that contractual provision is great evidence that the generators knew they were sticking up the state. . . . If they thought this was a reasonable contract, why wouldn't they want FERC to uphold their deal?""

State's Bargaining Position Was Weak

The companies with no-challenge clauses in their contracts included Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, Dynegy Power Marketing, Sempra Energy Resources, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., Coral Power and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading.

S. David Freeman, the state's chief negotiator on long-term power contracts who was recently named head of the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, said the clause needed to be understood in the context of the energy crisis.

At the time the contracts were negotiated, the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, had already failed to pay energy companies hundreds of millions of dollars for power purchases.

""Our reputation as a state for sticking by what we said and having credit was not all that great in January,"" he said. ""They were asking, 'Is this a serious deal? Is the state of California committed to it?' What are you going to say--no? [Then] you're not going to get a deal.""

The state began a hurried effort to negotiate long-term contracts in January after energy prices on the spot market spiraled to unprecedented heights. The costs threatened to bankrupt the state's utilities, which were unable to buy power on their own for their customers.

State officials negotiated dozens of contracts, some lasting as long as 10 years, which offered prices ranging from $58 to $249 per megawatt-hour--a far cry from the $500 per megawatt-hour the state was frequently paying on the spot market at the time.

But by summer, the wild energy market stabilized and prices dropped. California suddenly found itself paying more under the long-term contracts than the $15-to-$30 per megawatt-hour offered on the spot market.

""Look at the context in which the state was entering into these contracts. They were pretty much desperate,"" said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

""We were talking about windfall profits, taxes and seizing power plants, and I think the generators started putting in their contracts anything they could think of to keep the state from undoing the deal once things calmed down, which they have.""

Michael J. Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said the clauses provided ""the kind of reassurance that allows the financial community to say we're willing to invest in California.""

""It's not that we're superseding anything, frankly, it's that we've said we don't want the party we've done the transaction with to try to derail it,"" Niggli said.

He acknowledged that the contract clause cannot prevent the state from asking for federal review.

""The question becomes, 'Will FERC accept that or consider that?' "" he said. ""And then, 'Do we consider that a breach of the contract in any way shape or form?' ""

Bowen and Freeman predicted that the clauses would not stand up to court scrutiny. ""Frankly, I wasn't too concerned about the clause,"" Freeman said. ""I don't think it's enforceable.""

Enforceable or not, Bowen said, the clauses would complicate any state efforts to seek FERC review.

""The very fact that they were able to get that kind of language in the contracts tells you it wasn't an evenhanded situation,"" she said. ""I believe the state in negotiating the contracts did the best possible job it could under the circumstances, but that doesn't excuse [officials] from the responsibility of trying to improve the situation now.""

Here is my proposal for a definition of Delivery Point to address the risk that RTO-West will change the existing delivery points to a zonal system:


Delivery Point:  Mid-C or, if the Delivery Point of Mid-C ceases to exist or is modified by RTO-West or similar entity, the zone, physical location, or bus that reasonably resembles Mid-C in terms of liquidity, homogeneity, and physical location. 

Any suggestions?

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well.

        Attached is an initial draft of a letter agreement between AESC and LVC II, and Enron Power Marketing which is intended to set forth our understanding of the agreement reached between David Parquet and Dan Gordon yesterday.  Although prior versions of this document have been discussed with AESC, in the interest of expediting the review of the draft, it is being distributed to all parties simultaneously, and is for that reason subject to any further comments which AESC may have

concerning it.  

        Since I have not been involved in any of the existing agreements between Enron and Allegheny, I would appreciate it if those of you with knowledge of those matters ensure that I have accurately described in Paragraph 5 of this draft those agreements and the relevant parties to them.

        We look forward to your comments and to moving toward a resolution of the issues between the parties in the near future.

Agreed that all parties would review the proposed framework with traders to try to ""fill in the boxes"". It was however recognised that there were difficulties in interpreting what was intended by the proposed RTO's and the relationship with the current Into Cinergy market.
	
AEP viewed that purchase of transmission was the critical area, who had to purchase what and several scenarios to work through. Whether Seller buys a wheel, whether buyer buys a wheel, or under MISO both parties buy a  wheel. This clearly has knock on effect for obligations in respect of firm and non-firm transmission and curtailment. In particular, what if non-firm is elected and how this flows through into obligations of the parties to a transaction.
	
Perception that the framework prepared by AEP will start all interested parties in the same place to talk about the issues. 
	
It was agreed to try to get a representative from Duke to join the next call as they were an Into Cinergy product trader as well.
	
The next call was scheduled for November 29th at 10 o clock Eastern time. It was suggested that everyone at least take first page of Mitch's schedule and talk to the traders, since this would probably the best starting point, Mitch encouraged any comments to be shared earlier if possible.
	
Signed you up for this call in your absence.

Subject: Brownies! - Scouting for Food




Hello Brownie Families,

 

Our 1st grade Brownie troop is starting up!   During our first meeting, the girls learned a bit of GS history, said the Girl  Scout Promise and Law, sang two new GS songs and talked about the many  activities that they might participate in as a Girl Scout.  We also made 55  greeting cards for a Council sponsored service project where cards will be  sent to residents of nursing homes in Texas.  It was a great  meeting!

 

A few days after our troop meeting, we learned  of an interesting service opportunity.  

Scouting for Food is a special day, October 20th,  for Girl Scouts to help feed the hungry.  Girls ages 6-11years old will  tour the Houston Food Bank, participate in a service project, have a snack and  receive a ""Scouting for Food"" patch.

 

The specifics are:

Saturday, October 20th, 9:00 a.m. - 11:15  a.m.

Houston Food Bank, 3811 Eastex Freeway, Houston, TX  77026

A parent needs to accompany each  child.

Response deadline:  Wednesday, September 25, email Joy  Lee jeffjoylee@earthlink.net <<mailto:jeffjoylee@earthlink.net>> , or  713-660-8764

 

There is a fee of $3 per girl for this event.   The troop will be paying for the girls, therefore it is VERY IMPORTANT that we  have an accurate count.  There is no fee for the parents.

 

Sorry for the short deadline, but we have to pay to  reserve our spots and this event will fill up.

 

If you are interested in attending or have any  questions, please contact Joy quickly.

 

FYI... more will be arriving soon about other troop  activities.

 

Troop #12478 Leaders - Claire, Sheryl, Barbara and  Joy

   Elizabeth-  I sent you a letter today.  To summarize, I asked Lou 
   Alexander to prepare an evaluation of the accounts at Morgan Stanley.  I 
   did not get the information I needed so I sent the securities off to be 
   valued by a company that will turn it around in 5 days.  Once I have the 
   stock info, I can complete the return- without the expenses unless I get 
   them from you before then.  We can deduct on the return any expenses you 
   paid on behalf of your mother from date of death to present including 
   federal and state income taxes.  Send me a complete list as soon as 
   possible.  We can extend the return and pay an estimated amount of tax 
   with the extension.  I would prefer not to extend the return if possible 
   because it is so close to being complete. 
   The VA attorney told me that the consents need to be notarized.  I have 
   re-sent them to everyone requesting that signatures be notarized.  I 
   don't know why he couldn't let me know that sooner.

   I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that

   depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will

   you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA

Subject:	FW: Mandatory Setoff Language

Please see the attached note.  As our mass market retail contracts for Enron Direct Canada are much more unilateral in our favour, as this is more acceptable and consistent in this market segment, the existing set-off language in those forms provides broad rectangular set-off only in our favour.  My inclination is to leave it that way for these forms unless you think otherwise.  Peter.

SENT ON BEHALF OF DEREK FLAMAN:

Further to our meeting on July 17, I have reviewed both the new mandatory setoff language as set forth in Mark Haedicke's memo dated July 12, 2001 (the ""New Setoff Language"") and the setoff language contained in the Enron Direct retail forms (the ""Retail Setoff Language"").  The following are the most notable differences between the two:

1.	The New Setoff Language is drafted for ""triangular"" setoff purposes.  The Retail Setoff Language is drafted for ""rectangular"" cross-affiliate setoff; as such, Enron Direct may setoff any amounts owed by Enron Direct or any of its affiliates to counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates against any amounts owed to Enron Direct or any of its affiliates by counterparty or any of counterparty's affiliates.

2.	The New Setoff Language provides the non-defaulting party with the right of setoff - note that the non-defaulting party could be either an Enron entity or counterparty.  The Retail Setoff Language provides only Enron Direct with the right of setoff - counterparty has no setoff rights.

Given that:  (a)	the aforementioned differences are beneficial to Enron/Enron Direct, and (b) my understanding is that such differences are generally palatable to counterparties in the retail industry, please advise whether the New Setoff Language should be inputted into the Enron Direct retail forms.


Regards,
Derek

Bill,

As mentioned during our conference call this morning, we have significant
Lend and Park activity with ENA (and some activity with Enron Energy
Services).  Potential stressed net exposure peaks at $ 12.4 million in April
' 02.

Due to the recent downgrades of Enron Corp.'s (Guarantor of ENA's
obligations to PG&E) senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by S&P and other
rating agencies, we respectfully request that Enron North America provide
PG&E with a Standby Irrevocable Letter of Credit in the amount of $ 6.5
million expiring no earlier than October 30, 2002.  This request is made
under the provisions of PG&E's Gas Rule 25 (Gas Services-Customer
Creditworthiness and Payment Terms).

I would appreciate your letting me know when the L/C will be issued.  Thanks

Hope you had a good holiday.  When we spoke yesterday, I think I gave you a wrong number for Grant - His work number is 713 522 6300 (ask for Grant Cox).  He is expecting your call around 500 and will meet you in front of the Frost Bank Building on Norfolk (across from the post office).  Ella also has a note for you with this information.

Subject:	Availability for Conference Call


To All:
 
Please let me know your availability for a conference call  next week on 10/1-10/3 or 10/5 at 2pm Eastern TIme to discuss the  following:
 
1) Getting a EEI Contract Working Group organizational plan in  place asap.  The best antidote for preventing an Energy Industry Standards  Board from taking over the EEI Contract management is to have a separate,  well-defined and broadly-supported group in place.
 
3) Agenda and schedule for the next meeting of the Working  Group.
 
3) Adding new members to the drafting committe.  In  particular, Noel Trask of the Excelon Power Team has asked to join.
 
ASAP, I would like to get the optional provisions  circulated earlier this week up on the website and through the listserver   along w/ the announcement of our organizational proposal and future working  group meetings.
 
Thanks.

Subject:	RE: VEPCO

The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.  
I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.

Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.

Subject:	VEPCO
Importance:	High

Kevin and Elizabeth,

Attached is a proposal summarizing our restructuring talks with VEPCO last week.  We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They'd requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.

Discussion summary:
Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).
Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.
VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).
Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index
Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany
Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary
Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01

EESI would like to add the following to your revised Confirmation Agreement (red text only):

Special Conditions, paragraph (2) subparagraph (iii) shall be modified as follows:

""(iii) that any remedy that EESI may have against EPMI under this Transaction is limited by the remedy actually obtained by EPMI under the NYSEG Transaction (unless EPMI shall have failed to pay any uncontested amounts due and owing from EPMI to NYSEG under the NYSEG Transaction or EPMI shall have failed to deliver the Attributes received from NYSEG to EESI, in which case EESI shall have a claim against EPMI for the replacement value of the Attributes not delivered to EESI)""

If the above referenced change is acceptable please forward to me a revised Confirmation Agreement.

Ninth line ""or representations"" was added after the words ""any Affidavits""

POWER SALES AND TOLLING ARRANGEMENTS
IN TODAY'S MARKET

On Tuesday, June 5, 2001, Baker Botts will be presenting an internal legal
training seminar entitled ""Power Sales and Tolling Arrangements in Today's
Market"" in the main conference room on the 13th floor of our Washington
office, 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue (The Warner).  Bob Bohme, of our Washington
office, will be the speaker for the program.  He will address a number of
drafting and negotiation problems commonly encountered in power sales and
tolling agreements.  Although the program is geared toward lawyers, it may
also be of interest to non-lawyers involved in these negotiations.

"XOM","
----- Forwarded by Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 05/15/2001 05:01 PM -----


	Janice R Moore 05/04/2001 05:25 PM 	   To: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT  cc: John Malowney/Enron@EnronXGate  Subject: XOM	


Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least mostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's requirements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories of requirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has adoped a ""General Commercial Plan"" to comply with such requirements, XOM has promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a ""General Commercial Plan,"" so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's ability to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, but he did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to this.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence ""The Federal Contract Supplement is attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to the extent appplicable.""  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small business requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting from the ""gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its managerial and senior supervisory personnel"".  You can see the full details of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing staff to ""fudge"" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to you, now.
	UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's liability under Article 10.4(b).  

Let me know if you have any questions about this.  
Regards,
Janice

Emerging Market Forms is changed to Developing Products Market Forms to
better flow with the Committee focus on developing products with an
additional focus on weather derivatives and bandwidth.  This also appears to
be the appropriate place to explore the need to update ISDA's Commodity

Unless you have any objections or additional thoughts I'll go ahead and

"RE: Edison Electric Institute/Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement","Hi Scott

Enron was heavily involved in the EEI.

Anything and everything in the EEI can be changed.  I attach a sample of some our standard changes for your information.  We also add others from time to time.  Our position on issues depends upon the counterparty involved.  Feel free to amend choice of law, confirming party (which by the way sometimes EPMI also changes) and whatever else you want assuming you think appropriate for your dealings.  On typos, we know they exist but question whether there is anything misleading.  (We were under tremendous pressure to ""release"" the document - after release we do not want to ""re-release"" unless something is misleading.)  If you want to fix, feel free to do so in the cover page. 

   This is a sample of EPMI's older cover page amendments

Subject:	Edison Electric Institute/Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement

Elizabeth:

I am one of the contract attorneys from Bracewell & Patterson  assisting EES on various projects.  One of the matters which has been delegated to me is the review of a Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement between EES and A'lones.  I met with Richard Ring yesterday, and he indicated that you might be able to answer a few questions.  

First, Richard has informed me that ENA was heavily involved in the development of this document, and, as a result, the form is used ""as is"" and without amendment, save for information to be provided in the Cover Sheet.  One of my ""marching orders"" is that choice of law provisions in EES paper should require Texas law.  The Edison form opts for New York.  Is this something that can be changed? 

Second, what about more substantive matters, such as who takes the lead in sending transaction confirmations?  In the A'lones transaction, it is contemplated that EES will be the Buyer.  The Edison form places primary confirmation obligations on the Seller.  I am informed that EES prefers to be the confirming party, regardless of whether it is the buyer or seller.  Is this something that can be changed?

Third, there are a variety of typographical and reference errors.  i.e. double commas (see paragraph 2.2), doubled phrases (paragraph 5.1(h)(i)), and possibly mistaken use of defined terms (see use of ""Product"" in second line of paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2).  What is the Company's position on correcting these types of items?

I apologize that this is being e-mailed, as it would probably be quicker by phone, but my connection to the phone system is lagging somewhat behind my connection to the computer network.  Thank you for your time and attention.

Scott L. Franck
Bracewell & Patterson, L.L.P.

Subject: Power/gas trading structure


We are re-evaluating the EBS trading structure.  Currently, EBS uses a series of LLP's to minimize/avoid Texas franchise tax.  I detest LLP structures, as they can be hard to maintain; Lisa feels the same. Our EBS tax contact (Wayne Gardner) advises us that ENA/EPMI handle the franchise tax issue with some form of out-of-state swap, or something along that line.  I'm looking for a contact person who might know something about it.  I'm guessing Stephen Douglas is a good prospect, although I understand he is out.  Any thoughts/suggestions/cautions?
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

Hi, Liz.   Mom's car is being worked on this week, and I should get it back
tomorrow.  It will probably take me another month or two to get it licensed
in Maryland, because I don't want to take a day off from work to deal with
it.  I wonder if you would please start thinking of some system for
disbursing property from the estate.  Figuring out what to do with the car
has been more than vaguely troubling to me, and I think I figured out the
major reason why.  There are some X number of items of property in the
estate that need to be dealt with.   Each of us will likely want to keep
some and not care about others.  Some of them will likely need to be valued
within the estate, and some of them we can probably disburse informally and
outside of the estate.  How do you want to divide these things up?  The car
just seems to be the first of these things that we need to deal with,
because it costs money to maintain.   Shall we have a lottery for all of
the personal property items?  Shall we sell everything and disburse cash?
Or shall we do something in between?  I would like to deal with the car in
the context of everything else.  I do need a new car at some point soon,
but there is nothing sentimental to me about that car  that would make me
want to keep it (except that it is a convertible, which I could not justify
buying for myself at this point) unless I get it for below market value,
which would not be fair to you or Chi.   The blue book value of the car is
only about $2000, I think, at which price I would probably choose to keep
it until my legal fees are done with and I know where I stand financially.
It is possible we could sell it for $4000 - 5000, but I don't know.   I
know I would not pay $4000 for it.

Looking down the road, I know I think about wanting to improve Andrew's
room, and I think about wanting one of the chest of drawer's that are at
Bob's house.  This is probably sentimental, because I don't think Andrew
will care anytime soon, but, in any case, I don't know what the things are
worth.  I do know that I would like to have a system in place where I don't
need to worry too much about what dollar value we each think something is
worth.

As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349.

Elizabeth,

I have attached the index language we are currently using in confirmation letters.

 << File: Index Language Power.doc >> 

The Megawatt Daily Index language in the above attachment is used for Cinergy and Comed (the delivery points are not listed in the example).

Let me know if you need anything else.

You are playing Line 3 at 8:15.  The park (Oaks of Woodlake) is on the corner
of Ella Lee and Tanglewilde.   Ella Lee is one block north of Westheimer
(Between Briar Forest and Westheimer).  And Tanglewilde is one block east of
Gessner.  Park on the Tanglewilde side (there is a small parking lot or you
can park on the street).  Please bring water.  They have a water fountain,
but no ice.   I'm sorry you have to keep playing the late match, but that's
the way the lines keep working out.  I won't be playing, so would it be
possible for you to keep the scoresheet?  You can sign as captain, and I'll
just get the scoresheet from you when I see you.  Maureen Garrett will be
playing Line 4 at 7:00pm, and she can show you how the scoresheet works if
you have any questions.  Thanks a lot!

I expect to have copies of all the Master Agreements by 12:00 today, attached are the confirmations that are sent out in respect of the various delivery points.
	
             
	
I will need to see the ISDA, however, you are more familiar with what the standard language as it relates to the confirmation.
	
The NEPOOL confirmation does not reflect the most recent change that was made to fix the NEPOOL PTF points.
	
The language you sent me from Steve Hall closely resembles the current confirmation language used for the SP-15 and NP-15 delivery points.
	
From a regulatory perspective, as we discussed, we need to be better informed as to the issues and likely framework and structure of the RTOs, which will assist in the drafting of a relatively ""certain"" delivery point, however until the market is truly established I would expect there to be definitions which rely upon liquidity to feature and the different ways in which liquidity can be calculated, or the fixing of existing delivery points, or simply Seller's choice, possibly with some refinements and limitations as to where the power can be delivered.

Liz-

Hope all is well.  This is a follow up email to the phone message I left you
this morning.

Please see the attached email from Enron's Kimberly Indelicato.  From the
information I have received it appears that this issue has reared its head
because we have asked Enron to sign our EEI confirmation when EKT is the
Seller.  I have looked through our executed EEI and I find no amendment,
addition, deletion, etc.... to Article 2, Transaction Terms and Conditions,
Section 2.3 Confirmation.  EKT believes that it is in compliance with
Section 2.3.  Specifically ...""Seller may confirm a Transaction by
forwarding to Buyer by facsimile within three (3) Business Days after the
Transaction is entered into a confirmation (""Confirmation"") substantially in
the form of Exhibit A.""

EKT believes it has complied with the requirements of Section 2.3.

Please give me a call when you get a chance.

Sorry for the delay in responding (my external calls are not working) but it turns out that I have a scheduling conflict that will prevent me from speaking on Oct 11th/12th.   Thanks again for the invitation to speak - hopefully we will be able to speak again in the future.

Willy and I were thinking we would get a sitter from 5pm-11pm on Saturday
night for Sam , Ella and Lucy. What do you think?? The agency charges a
$ 30.00 flat fee and then anywhere from $10- $15 an hour after that.

Enron's Skilling Cites Stock-Price Plunge As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Post By John R. Emshwiller  08/16/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Jeffrey K. Skilling said that the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign Tuesday as the energy giant's chief executive officer after only about six months in the job.  In an interview yesterday, the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on his decision to leave Houston-based Enron. On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling insisted he had resigned for ""personal reasons"" unrelated to Enron's business activities.  In the interview, he reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to resign from the company's board or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed the CEO's duties at the nation's biggest energy trader.  However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his ""personal reasons"" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company's stock performance a ""kind of ultimate score card,"" Mr. Skilling noted that Enron's share price had fallen by some 50% this year.  Mr. Skilling said he took that stock-price drop very personally. ""I put a lot of pressure on myself"" for that decline, he said. ""I felt I must not be communicating well enough"" with investors. He felt this particularly given Enron's strong financial results over the past several quarters, based largely on growing volumes in its trading business, which covers a range of items, including electricity, pulp and paper.  If the stock price had remained up ""I don't think I would have felt the pressure to leave,"" he said.  In January, Enron topped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It closed Tuesday, before the announcement of Mr. Skilling's resignation, at $42.93 a share. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron traded at $40.25, after falling below $37 during the day.  Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the depressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron employees, many of whom are shareholders. ""People would say `What is going on with the stock, Jeff?' I would have to say I didn't know. It has been frustrating,"" said Mr. Skilling.  The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in the interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious, bright and thick-skinned business strategist whose long-held goal had been becoming Enron CEO. Mr. Skilling said that the ""final straw"" in his decision to leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection with the deaths of three Enron workers in a power-plant accident there. That trip helped reinforce ""how tenuous life is,"" said Mr. Skilling, who has three children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged.  While Mr. Skilling said Enron is in ""great shape,"" his departure raised anxiety in the investment community. Merrill Lynch, for instance, lowered its rating on Enron to neutral from buy based on ""uncertainty"" created by the resignation.  Yesterday, an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr. Lay plans to name two executives to the existing ""office of the chairman"" within the next few days or weeks. The spokesman said Mr. Lay hadn't yet revealed whom the two would be. The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling.

Subject:	trading bandwidth

'Seasoned Trader' Moving Up To Head Enron Broadband  By Erwin Seba  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   Jul. 17, 2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An executive described as ""a seasoned trader"" will lead Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit after its current chief executive takes a different position within corporation in the next two weeks. James Fallon, president and chief operating officer, will lead Enron Broadband Services after it becomes part of Enron's Wholesale Services Group.   Broadband Services Senior Vice President Kelly Kimberly told Dow Jones Newswires Fallon will lead the organization after Kenneth Rice, chairman and chief executive, moves to a corporate job at Enron.   Fallon was unavailable to talk to Dow Jones for this story.   One broker said Fallon's selection indicated Enron isn't backing away from developing the bandwidth market.   ""Jim Fallon is a seasoned trader,"" the broker said. ""He made a killing in the power markets. He has a huge reputation for making money.""   The broker speculated that Fallon may increase the number of traders Enron has in the bandwidth market. Broadband Services has announced plans to reassign and possibly layoff non-trader employees in the coming two weeks.   An analyst said Fallon's appointment indicates future growth for Enron's bandwidth business.   ""I think Fallon is someone who wouldn't be there if it isn't a good opportunity,"" said Raymond Niles, director of power and merchant energy research with Salomon Smith Barney.   In his new role, Fallon will report to Mark Frevert, chairman and chief executive of Enron Wholesale Services, and Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer of Wholesale Services.   Rice previously reported to Kenneth Lay, corporate chairman and chief executive.   Before becoming president of Broadband Services, Fallon was managing director of global trading and risk management for the unit.   From 1993 to 1999, he worked in Enron North America's wholesale energy business rising from the position of associate to managing director, leading the power trading business.   Before coming to Enron, Fallon was a nuclear operations engineer for General Electric, a systems engineer at W.R. Grace and a certified public accountant for Price Waterhouse.   Fallon earned a bachelor's degree in marine engineering from the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, a master's degree in accounting from Northeastern University and a master's in business administration from Columbia University.   Fallon takes over a unit that lost $102 million in the second quarter of this year and is going through a restructuring to reduce losses at the same time bandwidth prices continue to plummet.   -By Erwin Seba, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9214; erwin.seba@dowjones.com <mailto:erwin.seba@dowjones.com>   NRG0119800084

The two Reliant deals that were sent to Legal (the EOL and non EOL) have already been given to Leslie Hansen for review.

As for the Schedule C being added to the west trades, should Christian or Steve be the attorney to handle those?  Do we have an attorney in the group in Houston familiar with the WSPP?

David,
I understand you are speaking with Shari Stack of Reliant regarding the wording of the option confirmation letters.  I had two other questions that you might help us with.  Sent to legal (deal 702644.01, 700154.01) EOL and non EOL deal, Enron states: Firm (LD) Energy  Reliant is striking through and placing firm (ld) Energy in lowercase.  
[Portz, David]  I think Genia has already allocated these to another attorney(s) in the group, or if she hasn't already, will.   I think it matters which Reliant affiliate you are speaking of, because we only have the EEI in effect with one of them, and ""Firm (LD)"" is a defined product type under the EEI. 


Also on our West trades, Product:  West Firm Energy
Reliant is adding service schedule C. [Portz, David]   I am requesting that Genia Fitzgerald designate an attorney who will help you with this. 

I can refax the above confirmations for your review if needed.

NRG Power Marketing:  The past trades that have not been signed by the counterparty, are those considered executed now that we have an EEI agreement?  
Does it cover the additional language in confirmations such as SP 15, NP 15, Nepool language? [Portz, David]    Past trades brought under the EEI Master were referenced on an Attachment A to the EEI Master dated effective June 29th 2001, prepared by Rhonda in coordination with NRG.  As such, the commercial terms of those confirms (corresponding with the numbers on the Attachment A spreadsheet) have clearly been affirmed in writing by the parties; price has not been specifically affirmed in writing however, and the remaining confirmation boilerplate is intended by the parties to be superseded by the EEI Master's terms.  It would thus seem advisable to reconfirm any currently outstanding trades on using the format(s) of EEI confirmation agreed betweent he parties.    The specific language re SP 15, NP 15, & Nepool would remain in effect as to the underlying trades  --  the EEI Master's text does not treat those matters anyway.  

Thanks for your help!

I assume that you may have already handled this, but just in case I thought I would remind you that the expiration date under the existing standstill agreement is June 20th.  My general sense is that I thought we probably would want to extend it, at least once to see if any type of deal is possible.  Is that the current thinking?

I assume that your groundstrokes are pretty powerful now since you have been practicing for a few days with very haeavy and soggy tennis balls.  In all seriousness, I hope that you made it through the weekend ok.

Subject:	EnronOnline definition of West Firm

Elizabeth:

The EEI cover sheet defines West Firm as follows:  ""West Firm"" means with respect to a Transaction, a Product that is or will be scheduled as firm energy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the WSCC for which the only excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (i) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreement; or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in Article 4 of this Agreement.  

EnronOnline defines ""West Firm"" as ""power that is or will be scheduled as firm energy consistent with the most recent rules adopted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council for which the only excuses for failure to deliver or receive are if an interruption is (i) (a) due to an Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of the WSPP Agreement if the WSPP Agreement governs this transaction or (b) due to an event of force majeure as such term is defined under such other agreement between the Seller and the Buyer that governs this transaction (the ""Agreement""); or (ii) where applicable, to meet Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the WSPP Agreement or the Agreement, if applicable, if Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages for failure to deliver firm energy as provided in Section 21.3 of the WSPP Agreement, if applicable, or as provided in the applicable cover remedy section(s) of the Agreement.  ""WSPP Agreement"" means the Western System Power Pool Agreement as amended from time to time.

I wanted to confirm that I should revise the EOL description to delete the hilited language.  Please advise.

Dear Elizabeth;

As per Mark Haedicke's request, please be kind enought to provide me with the short term PPA template that Enron uses in North America and Canada.  Mark asked me to compare the US/Canada and the Brazilian versions for clients who do not have a good credit history and, as consequence, will not enter into a Master Power Trading Agreement type of document.

Thanks and Regards,

Attached is the rental application. Our plans are taking shape for the trip to Wintergreen.  My sister will be flying into Dullus Thursday night and will head for Charlottesville.  Could she pick the keys up Thursday evening around 8:30 or 9pm and drop off a check at that time? She plans to stay in a hotel Thursday night, but will be the first to arrive at the house on Friday. 
Several questions -   Could you e-mail me directions to your house and to the house in Wintergreen?  I am planning on giving you two checks-  one for $500. for the three nights and one for $150.00 for the deposit. Is that correct? Does Wintergreen have a pool and or a clubhouse of any sort that serves lunch or dinner?  Is there a grill at the house. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

Please find attached a form of a form of retail gas contract and retail electricity contract which we are currently using.  In the retail gas contract, the relevant provisions of the terms and conditions are s.19 Obligations to Third Parties, s.25 Amendments and s.26(c) Termination.

In the retail electricity agreement, the relevant provision is s.25(c).

Subject:	RE: Reg out language

Firstly, we had some clauses that were in used pre-Alberta dereg. in wholesale confirms that were intended to give us outs in the event that we were found liable for market interference (which ultimately we were not) under ""Project Stanley"", and also to deal with the fact that there was some threat that market opening may be delayed or that there may be adverse regulatiory interference (such as price caps).  We no longer use these clauses and they were problematic for a number of reasons, including that they were difficult to draft in a way that disguised the issue from our perspective and nonetheless made the transaction ""firm"" and acceptable to our counterparties.

We also have more general reg. out language in our retail contracts, which by their nature are far more unilateral and less negotiated.

Mark Powell can e-mail you all of these clauses.

Hi Peter

We are starting to work w EES on various retail transactions and the issue of reg outs is front and center for them, what with all the changes that will occur in response to the California crisis.  I think I remember you saying that some of the Canadian deals had reg out clauses.  Do you have any good reg out language that you think would be helpful for me to look at? Thanks

	Payment through Wed - 11/14 (with interest) = $14,153,688.78
	Payment through Thur - 11/15 (with interest) = $14,155,586.71

The Settlement Agreement is written based on a Wed payment - if they want to argue for another $1,100 in interest, then we can send it to them in pennies.

Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.

Hi Liz,
 
It was fun catching up with you at  Dr.Injak's.  Like you, I married a geologist (my dad and brother-in-law are  also geologists).  It's a nice change from lawyers.  
I hope Sam is doing OK.  What did the doctor  say to do for him?
Let me know what your schedule is like and we can  meet some time.  I'm fairly flexible, but have a nanny only 2 days per  week, so the rest of the time Connor is with me.  My little  shadow.
 
Ciao,
Kathy Ellis Cook

Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a physical deal with EPMI.

FERC Judge Rejects Claims For Elec Refunds In Pacific NW
  
09/24/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shouldn't order refunds for power sales in the Pacific Northwest, a FERC administrative law judge told the commission Monday. 
""I recommend that the commission not order refunds in this case because the prices weren't unreasonable and, unlike (California), the market is a competitive market,"" concluded Carmen Cintron, the FERC judge presiding over the case. 
The spiraling prices in California's dysfunctional power market were only one of many factors contributing to the region's high electricity prices, which were primarily the result of a supply shortage as the hydropower-dependent region experienced a drought, the judge said. 
""Spot market bilateral sales constituted only a small percentage of the total volume of transactions in the region because forward contracts are heavily relied on,"" Cintron said. 
Overruling the finding of FERC trial staff, Cintron found there was no evidence that sellers exercised market power in the region. 
""The prices were agreed to by willing buyers and sellers,"" the judge said. 
The judge urged FERC to grant a motion by Puget Energy Inc. (PSD) and dismiss the case. 
     
At issue were refund claims totaling more than $1.9 billion, with three-quarters of that amount claimed by California on behalf of the state's Department of Water Resources for purchases in the refund period of Dec. 25, 2000, to June 20, 2001. 
In July, FERC set the case for an expedited hearing before Cintron after separating the Pacific Northwest claims from a larger refund proceeding involving power sales in California from Oct. 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001. 
The administrative law judge is scheduled to forward an initial decision to the commission in the California refund case in December. 
Unlike California, the Northwest had a vibrant and functional competitive market, and ordering refunds for the minority of those in the proceeding making claims would have detrimental effects on the market, Cintron told the commission. 
""Evidence of record indicates that refunds would have a negative impact to the Pacific Northwest market,"" Cintron concluded. ""This business relies on finality of deals and reliance on your trading partner."" 
""Balancing the short-term benefit of refunds to a few market participants against the immediate and long-term damage to the market and to future investment decisions, it is impossible to reconcile refunds with the overall public-interest standard,"" Cintron said. 
California sought $1.466 billion of the nearly $2 billion in total claims. The remainder was claimed by municipally owned utilities in Seattle ($278 million); Tacoma, Wash. ($65.4 million); Clark, Wash. ($64 million); Eugene, Ore. ($39.7 million); Sacramento, Calif. ($4.6 million); and Northern Wasco County, Ore. ($4 million). 
Also, the Port of Seattle sought $9.4 million in refunds. 
Cintron was persuaded by the ""ripple"" claims arguments of the majority opposing refunds. They argued that awarding the claims of the few seeking refunds would destabilize the overall market, since most sellers themselves would then stake claims for refunds. 
""Unraveling these transactions is, to be mildly stated, a complex task,"" Cintron said. 
""The immense number of potential ripple claims is directly related to the highly active nature of the (Pacific Northwest) wholesale electricity market,"" the judge said. 
""Given the sheer magnitude of contracts that would have to be rewritten as a result of ordering refunds, it would be impossible to unwind the chain of transactions that resulted in a single bilateral sale,"" she said. 
The commission may either accept or reject Cintron's recommendations, which were intended to form the basis for whether FERC should order a more expansive hearing to determine refund amounts owed. 
In the event FERC does move to order refunds, Cintron offered her conclusions on what constitutes a spot-market sale in the region's bilateral contracts market. 
While power marketers had argued for a strict definition - sales of no more than 24 hours duration - those seeking refunds had argued that refunds should apply to sales for periods of up to a year or longer, particularly if they were indexed to spot-market prices. 
Cintron accepted the middle-of-the road recommendation of the Bonneville Power Administration to conclude that spot-market sales should include transactions of up to one-month duration.

Subject:	FW: UNSCHEDULED DEMAND PENALTY

Elizabeth,

Greetings.  I hope you enjoyed your vacation.  

In the midst of all of the bad news from California, I thought I would pass on some good news.  You may recall that a while back I encouraged Gov't & Regulatory affairs to withdraw a complaint they had filed with FERC to suspend the ISO's underscheduling penalty.  I asked them to withdraw it because the CAISO Tariff said that the ISO would pay the penalty to Scheduling Coordinators that correctly scheduled load and did not incur the penalty (read Enron).  To make a long story short, Enron withdrew its complaint and FERC ordered that the ISO continue to impose the penalty for the time being.

We just received word today that the ISO is crediting us with approximately $30 million in underscheduling payments.  Although with the defaults we may not get full payment, perhaps we can use this as a bargaining chip/offset with California if we have to make refund payments to the ISO.

Steve

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve

A quick update on where we are:

We have asked for documents from Consumers and should be getting those in the next week or so.  We have also asked to take the depositions of the two Consumers' bookkeepers who allegedly made the ""payment mistake.""  Those should take place in the next three to four weeks.  To date, Consumers has not indicated a desire to conduct any discovery whatsoever.  Unbelievable.  Our counsel believes that Consumers doesn't really think this case will be arbitrated; but rather is hoping that as we approach an arbitration date, we will become much more willing to compromise.  As far as an arbitration date is concerned, nothing is set yet. We have agreed to approach the arbitrator (Professor White) after the depositions and check his calendar for available dates. I do think that, given Consumers cash-poor situation, they will attempt to get this matter resolved by year-end.  

Call me with questions.  Otherwise, I will keep you updated.

Subject: Sierra Pacific Power/Nevada Power



Elizabeth, 

Background: On Wednesday, October 10, the NPUC voted to authorize its General Counsel to seek to void or renegotiate certain SPP/NP long-term power contracts by either going to court or filing a complaint at FERC.  According to the utilities, the contracts are out-of-the-money by approximately $800 million. 

Enclosed, you'll find. . . .:  Attached is a spreadsheet showing all of the physical Enron-SPP/NP deals that are (1) currently flowing or (2) scheduled for future delivery.  I have left off transactions that have been completed because the tenor of SPP/NP's statements indicates that they are seeking prospective relief, not refunds.

I am also going to fax to you two pages showing our credit exposure to SPP and NP.  Worst case, back of the envelope, we are looking at approximately $400 million in MTM exposure for all deals.  However, the prices under these deals range from $27.50/MWh to $311/MWh (the $3.60 deal is for transmission).  It's extremely unlikely that FERC would (1) void every transaction or (2) reduce the price for every deal to $0.  Therefore, the true amount at risk is less than $400 million.

Bottom line:  All in all, I think the risk of FERC undoing these transactions is unlikely for the following reasons: 

1.  The ALJ in the Pacific Northwest refund case rejected claims for refunds of bilateral transactions because (1) the non-California long-term market was competitive, and (2) because of the concern about ""ripple"" claims.  Although the Commission has not yet adopted the ALJ's recommendation, I expect they will because it's the path of least resistance and has popular support.

2.  SPP/NP is the only party arguing that the Southwest market is uncompetitive.  This aspect was fatal to the Pacific Northwest claims because the majority of the market did not want refunds.

3.  SPP/NP was not required to buy power under these contracts----unlike the California utilities, which were required to buy from the PX.  Presumably, these were the lowest prices available at the time.

4.  If FERC voids or reprices these contracts, it will be pressured to do the same for California's DWR contracts. 

Contracts/Collateral:  These transactions are all under the WSPP.  We currently hold no collateral from SPP/NP.  Tracy Ngo informs me that we have not insisted on margin or additional collateral because her understanding was that the WSPP did not let her ask for collateral absent an objective event, such as a credit downgrade or failure to get a rate increase.  I advised her that the WSPP standard allows for a call for collateral if the counterparty's ""financial viability"" decreases.  My view is that SPP/NP's admission that it is $800 million under water is, in itself, cause for a margin call.  I am, however, sensitive to the fact that a margin call might (1) be perceived as ""punishing"" SPP/NP for ""trying to enforce the law,"" or (2) strengthen SPP/NP's resolve to seek refunds.  Tracy will not request collateral until you have weighed in on this.

Mitigation:  I spoke with Tim Belden and Tracy Ngo about this on Monday the 15th.  There is zero interest in trying to work with SPP/NP on a blend/extend.  ""Why should we loan a shaky counterparty more money?""  There is also the feeling that we stand a great chance of winning at FERC.  Ultimately, we three were unable to come up with any ways to mitigate the exposure, other than being ready to vigorously respond to this challenge at FERC and being prepared to issue a statement to the press after the complaint is filed at FERC.

    CALIF. DWR AGREES TO FOOT WINDFALL PROFITS TAX FOR SOME
     Some generators that have reached long-term contract deals
with California will not have to pay a windfall profits tax if
it's approved by the legislature, reports Dow Jones Newswires
after an state Senate Energy Committee hearing yesterday.
Instead, the Dept. of Water Resources will foot the bill.
     DWR director Ray Hart told lawmakers: ""In some of our
contracts, in order to preserve economics, we had to assure
(generators) that we were not going to tax them."" Critics said it
didn't make sense since the state would essentially be taxing
itself. One official with Dynegy Inc. said dealing with the DWR
""was like playing poker with a second grader"" since the agency
seemed willing to ""give up a lot"" (Dow Jones Newswires, Jun. 21).

I just realized, since you weren't on my original roster...you may not be a
HTA member.  If you're not, you will need to pay your dues before you play.
I can fax you a form, and you can mail it in ASAP.  The dues are $10 for an
individual and $12.50 for a family for the Fall League Season (Aug-Dec 2000).
 HTA memberships should be mailed to:

Susan,
  
  Thank you for all of the documents.  I am expecting that we will be able to turn another draft out tomorrow (Tuesday) but I do want Sam to see it before it goes out and I have not made contact with him today (Monday).  I will touch base with you again tomorrow on timing.  I am using very little of the original draft and instead, am using almost everything that you sent to us.

  The outline of notes from Alan and Mike that you sent to me seemed to reference Mike Roan's comments.  I have the ouline with Alan's comments and their joint outline but I do not have a stand alone document for Mike Roan. 
I
  will work with what I have but if you do have a separate document from Mike and want me to use it, could you please send it to me if you  have a free minute?  The other material from Alan and Mike seems helpful.  

Thanks very much,

Cathy

Attached are:

1.  The outline I e-mailed you previously, with Alan Comnes' comments.
Basically Alan has added a Section II, which arguably could be
incorporated into Section IV of the previous outline.  

2.  An outline of some notes from Alan Comnes and Mike Roan (both
economists).  Some of these points may be useful to add; please do so at
your discretion.

3.  EPSA's draft comments for your information (could not remember
whether I had forwarded them to you).

Hi Moms,
If you have some time on Tuesday afternoon, we  could use some additional hands at the Brownie meeting.  One of our  projects will be to make a ""sit-upon"".  The girls will be lacing and  beading and we think some extra hands to help will be necessary.   Please reply if you can make it.  We probably will be  starting the project around 3:50 or 4pm.

Dear Market Participants:

Methodology used in developing the NYISO Virtual Bidding Credit
Requirements:

Day Ahead Market Hourly Zonal LBMP and Real Time Market Integrated Hourly
Zonal LBMP values were used as the data source for developing the NYISO
Virtual Bidding Credit Requirements.  These values are available on the
NYISO web site.  The time period of June 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001
was used.  Peak hours are defined here as the hours of 6am (06:00) through
and including 10pm (22:00).  The absolute value of the difference of the
DAM and R/T price was calculated for each peak hour.  The 97th percentile
of these series of prices was calculated for each zone.  The maximum of
these zonal 97th percentiles was calculated to be $159.33.  The data
manipulation and calculation was performed in MS Excel. The attached
spreadsheet contains the data used in the June 2001 to August 2001
calculations.

"RE: Faith-based contracting","HI 

So much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards Enron and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked Mike Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (Shari's name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  

ps - the meeting in San Diego on the 1st is still unclear for Houston based Enron employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get Mike to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.

Hoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.

Subject:	Faith-based contracting

I agree with Christian that we cannot win over the WSPP folks simply by telling them that their contract is not as good as ours.  Everytime I venture out to the larger NW community of IOUs, munis, and federal PMA's I realize that the WSPP is more than a contract, it's almost a religion.  One cannot convince a Muslim that the Bible is better written than the Koran.

Whether it's assimilation or merger, or the hint that the WSPP might be destined for a larger role in advocacy and education, we need to give Mike Small a face-saving way of relinquishing the WSPP contract.  Modifying the WSPP to look like the EEI only strengthens the resolve of WSPP-ers to stick with the original contract.---""Why should I change, the agreements are virtually identical?""

Elizabeth, 

I am going to divide my presentation into two parts.  One is going to be designed to give the marketers ""talking points""  and the other is going to be a technical thing where I show them some bad wording and tell a couple of scary war stories. 

I would like to get your take on the following kind of big picture Enron policy on WSPP approach. Unless you agree with and support this kind of ""How Enron views the WSPP"" policy, I shouldn't be advocating it at the meeting.   

Enron's view is that the days of comparing the WSPP Agreement to the EEI should be coming to an end.  It is time for a joint committee of WSPP and EEI experts to merge the agreements.  Everybody is wasting too much time comparing the two agreements and trying to say one is better than the other.  Every amendment that has been made in the past two years brings the agreements closer and closer into alignment and it is preposterous for any serious lawyer to argue that we are better off with two agreements, one that is almost like the other one.  Valuable resource time is being wasted.  Enron believes that a joint committee should accelerate the merger of the agreements. 

 This will free up the WSPP organization to do what it does best:  provide an extremely useful industry formum kind of function.  The WSPP should be focusing on more boondoggles and more future looking work like getting ready for RTO West, dealing with the emerging California changes, and open access in Oregon and Nevada.   Right now, the highly talented regional organization is spending an unfortunate amount of time trying to distinguish its contract from the EEI when both are converging toward the same center.  This unfortunate distraction is keeping the WSPP from adding the tremendous value it does add through its boondoggles and industry issue discussions. The WSPP organization is needed for bigger and better things than dragging us through an ever narrowing labyrinth of legal distinctions. 

We need this kind of glazed over positive spin on the WSPP process because our marketers do not like to be isolated from the cozy herd at these boondoggles.  Sales people do not want to feel alone and different.  They are all about the slimy intimacy of sales.  It is hard for Stewart Rosman to go to Cour d'Lane and have Greg Wolf and Shari Stack confront him with difficult questions about why Enron is voting so and so on such and such.  He wants to feel loved.  Therefore,  this policy would let our marketers praise the WSPP for being a great organization,  but at the same time, advocate that it become even greater by declaring victory on the contract front and shifting over to more important projects.  Rosman should say:  Enron loves the WSPP,  it has done a great job with the contract reformation,  that task is done,  we now should move on to bigger and better tasks.  Let's get the contract stuff wrapped up with a joint committee and get more important matters on the agenda.   

Something like this is what we need to do with this ongoing mess.  Otherwise, we pit Enron's clearmindedness  against a stubborn mass of  inert resistance and much toxic upheaval is the only result. 
The world, including our little western power world, is not made up of people sitting around trying to be rational.  It is full of all of the conflicts of history, ambitious tirades, irrational idiocyncracies and strong personalities.  The WSPP institution is like one of the warring tribes of Lebanon.  They are not going to go away.  Enron needs to be more subtle in its regional diplomacy.  Praise them as we bury them on the contract front.  As our headquarters commander, I beg you to  let Steve and me, as field operatives,   pursue this diplomatic initiative over the next months. We can wind these guys up to talk this kind of talk next Wednesday.   One consequence of the policy is that you would have to urge the EEI bureacracy to embrace a joint committee approach.   ----cgy

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a ""rectangular""
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Hi Elizabeth,

I am following up a case that Global Risk Markets was working on about 3 months ago.  I believe it is called Deacero located in Mexico.  It was a power sale agreement and I think Bob Carter was working on the case while he was still with Enron.  We wanted to know what the status of the case was and who is now handling Bob's responsibilities.

TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY:
(Written by Andy Rooney ..................................., BUT FROM ME!)

I've learned....That the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an
elderly person.

I've learned....That when you're in love, it shows.

I've learned....That just one person saying to me, ""You've made my day!""
makes my day.

I've learned....That having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the
most peaceful feelings in the world.

I've learned....That being kind is more important than being right.

I've learned....That you should never say no to a gift from a child.

I've learned....That I can always pray for someone when I don't have the
strength to help him in some other way.

I've learned....That no matter how serious your life requires you to be,
everyone needs a friend to act goofy with.

I've learned....That sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a
heart to understand.

I've learned....That simple walks with my father around the block on summer
nights when I was a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....That life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets
to the end, the faster it goes.

I've learned....That we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask
for.

I've learned....That money doesn't buy class.

I've learned....That it's those small daily happenings that make life so
spectacular.

I've learned...That under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be
appreciated and loved.

I've learned....That the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me
think I can?

I've learned.... That to ignore the facts does not change the facts.

I've learned....That when you plan to get even with someone, you are only
letting that person continue to hurt you.

I've learned....That love, not time, heals all wounds.

I've learned....That the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to

I've learned....That opportunities are never lost; someone will take the
ones you miss.

I've learned....That when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock
elsewhere.

I've learned....That I wish I could have told my Mom that I love her one
more time before she passed away.

I've learned....That one should keep his words both soft and tender because
tomorrow he may have to eat them.

I've learned....That a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.

I've learned....That I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do
about it.

I've learned....That when your newly born grandchild holds your little
finger in his little fist, that you're hooked for life.

I've learned....That everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all
the happiness and growth occurs while you're climbing it.

I've learned....That it is best to give advice in only two circumstances;
when it is requested and when it is a life threatening situation.

I've learned....That the less time I have to work with, the more things I
get done.

I've learned....Friends are very rare jewels, indeed.  They make you smile
and encourage you to succeed.  They lend an ear, they share words of praise
and they always want to open their hearts to us.


It's National Friendship Week. Show your friends how much you care.  Send
this to everyone you consider a FRIEND, even if it means sending it back to
the person who sent it to you.  If it comes back to you, then you'll know
you have a circle of friends.

HAPPY FRIENDSHIP WEEK!  YOU ARE MY FRIEND,  I AM YOURS, AND I AM DEEPLY
HONORED!

Elizabeth,

Greetings.  I hope you enjoyed your vacation.  

In the midst of all of the bad news from California, I thought I would pass on some good news.  You may recall that a while back I encouraged Gov't & Regulatory affairs to withdraw a complaint they had filed with FERC to suspend the ISO's underscheduling penalty.  I asked them to withdraw it because the CAISO Tariff said that the ISO would pay the penalty to Scheduling Coordinators that correctly scheduled load and did not incur the penalty (read Enron).  To make a long story short, Enron withdrew its complaint and FERC ordered that the ISO continue to impose the penalty for the time being.

We just received word today that the ISO is crediting us with approximately $30 million in underscheduling payments.  Although with the defaults we may not get full payment, perhaps we can use this as a bargaining chip/offset with California if we have to make refund payments to the ISO.

Steve

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve

Elizabeth,

In his absence, Christian asked me to prepare long-form WSPP confirms to govern existing transactions between EPMI and the above counterparties.  While we are also working on EEI agreements with these counterparties, existing credit exposure is high and Tracy Ngo has requested that we move forward with the WSPP confirms as a stop-gap measure.  I would like to run the confirms by you for approval early next week before sending them to the counterparties.  Let me know if this works for you.

Feel free to contact me by email or phone at (503) 294-9829.

Justin

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion
List:


COLLATERAL CALCULATION FOR APPLICANTS FOR THE VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS MARKET:

The largest price delta observed at the 97th percentile level during June,
July, and August, 2001, was $159.33. This
amount  should be rounded to the nearest dollar amount ($159.00) when used
in the collateral calculation process..

The collateral formula is as follow:

The price delta of $159.00 is multiplied by the exposure calculation factor
of 14 ($159.00 x 14 = $2,226.00).  This equals the dollar amount of
collateral required per mega watt hour (MWH).  The $2,226.00 is then
multiplied by the maximum number of MWH's the Market Participant may wish
to bid on a daily basis.  The Market Participant notifies the NYISO of the
maximum number of MWH's they  may wish to bid  per day by completing,
executing and returning the  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CERTIFICATION OF
UNDERSTANDING OF NYISO FINANCIAL ASSURANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR
VIRTUAL TRANSACTIONS.  This document is attached to Addendum A of the NYISO
Registration Packet dated August 28, 2001.(refer to Page A6 of the Addendum
A).  The NYISO Registration Packet is located on the NYISO web site at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations/cregistration/pdf/nyiso_reg.pdf

The example used in Addendum A stated the Market Participant wished to bid
up to a maximum of 1600 MWH's per day.

In this example, the collateral required would be $2,226.00 x 1600.
Consequently, the collateral requirement to bid up to a maximum of 1600
MWH's per day in the Virtual Transactions Market would be $3,561,600.

Please contact NYISO Customer Relations if you have any questions.

NYISO Customer Relations

I understand that the Broadmoor is sold out for the night of the 9th, including the block of rooms held for the WSPP Contracting Meeting.  There is a waiting list, but the waiting list is long.  Here is a list of alternate hotels/resorts in the area, the hotels/resorts have been checked and they do have rooms available:

Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort  (2.5 miles away from Broadmoor)
3225 Broadmoor Valley Road
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-538-4000

Doubletree World Arena       (3 miles from Broadmoor)
1775 E. Cheyenne Mountain Boulevard
Colorado Springs, CO   80906

Sheraton Colorado Springs Hotel     (3 miles from Broadmoor)
2886 South Circle Drive
Colorado Springs, CO   80906
719-576-5900

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but when the arrangements were made for the meeting, there were plenty of rooms available at that time.

Subject:	RE: ERCOT language in long form

Harlan and I have discussed the issue.  For all long-form confirms, EOL and over-the-counter, please describe the commodity as follows:  Firm (LD) Energy, consistent with the terms of the ""Firm (LD)"" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00) including without limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation attached as Annex A.

With the change to the commodity description to make clear that the Schedule P definition of Firm (LD) trumps the GTCs, we do not need to revise the GTCs at this point.  (I am updating the GTCs to conform to the EEI and will let you know as soon as the new version is ready for roll-out in the confirmation process.)

Can you advise Sharen on the EOL GTC?

David Portz indicated that the long form would need to be modified to accept the new ERCOT language.  We have some deals that need to be confirmed on the long form with an ERCOT delivery point.  Can someone take a look at these and tell us what needs to be done, or do we send them out as is for now.

In addition, does the EOL GTC need to be modified to accommodate the new ERCOT language.  We have some deals to be confirmed on the EOL GTC in the ERCOT delivery points.

Thanks!
