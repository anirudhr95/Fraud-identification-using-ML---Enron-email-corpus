BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant ""live"" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we could've
gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days and
then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to
catch up on and I am going to be tenacious in my attempts to get a hold of
you...let me know when you have time to talk.  I am out this weekend but
maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.

Take care and stay safe.

1. Eggs and bacon (me)/biscuits (you).  Dishes (me).  Walk with dogs (us).
2. Meet at home, slip into our running gear, grab the dogs, and go to
Memorial for a jog.  Stop on the way home and pick something up for dinner

"RE: Hi!","
I am soooo sorry I am not able to watch them for you.  I feel bad because I
said I could.
I just didn't plan on all of this going on at the same time as your trip.
Yall are going to have
a blast!    The 10th is right around the corner.

I got a loan through Countrywide.  It is a good deal because I am going
with a no income/no asset loan.  Basically I don't disclose any of that
information.  I have to pay a higher rate because of it but it is the
easiest way for me to qualify.  Especially since the down payment is not
coming from my own funds.  But the rate isn't that bad because Countrywide
will pay a point for me since I have been here over a year.  It's just a
matter of finding the house I want.
I will let you know as soon as I get a signed contract.  Then you can come
to my house warming party!!  = )

The truck should be here anyday now.  I am very excited.  I feel like I
have waited forever!!  You remember when I first started talking about it
back in Dec of 2000.  That was a year and a half ago!!  Now I finally get
it.  Yipppppeeee!!!

The dogs are good.  I took Cookie and Tyson home for Mother's Day weekend.
Lucy and Tyson played like crazy!!
Mike fell in love with him.  He wants them both.  hee hee.  He is bringing
Lucy up to Dallas soon and I get to keep her for SIX MONTHS!!  That is
going to be insane.  (and alot of doodie too!!!)  But I know she will be
happy.  They all got along fine in San Antonio.  Oh, and Tyson LOVES
Cookie.  He licks her ears and eyes all the time.  And then she licks him
back.  It is really cute.

When do I get to see you???????????
MIss you,

Jul

I got back form Germany on Friday and have been trying to catch up with
work
before our trip to Alaska.  We leave this Sunday the 10th.  Monique's
brother is going to watch the dogs while we're gone so don't worry about
it.
It sounds like you've got your hands full.

It's great you're buying a house.  We just can't seem to figure out what we
want to do.  Monique is so stressed out with work right now I'm not sure
how
much longer we'll be in Houston.

Did you get a good loan?  Did you get your truck yet?

Hi Worm,

How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!
What are the dates you are going to Alaska?
Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?
Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!
I have two offers on the table right now.
Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one
I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,
I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.
How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?
Let me know.
Love,
Jul

 Imponderables 
1)      If you take an  Oriental person and spin them around several times, do they become  disOriented? 
2)       If people from Poland are called Poles, why aren't people from Holland called  Holes? 
3)      Why  do we say something is out of whack? What's a whack? 
4)      Do infants enjoy infancy as much as  adults seem to enjoy adultery? 
5)      If a pig loses it's voice, does it  become disgruntled? 
6)      If love is blind, why is lingerie so  popular? 
7)       When someone says to you, ""A penny for you thoughts!"", and you put your two  cents in, what happens to the other penny?
8)      Why is the man who  invests all your money called a broker? 
9)      Why do croutons come in airtight  packages? It's just stale bread to begin with. 
10)     When cheese gets its picture taken, what does  it say? 
11)     Why is a  person who plays a piano called a pianist, but a person who drives a race car  not called a racist? 
12)     Why are a wise man and a wise guy  opposites? 
13)     Why do  overlook and oversee mean opposite things? 
14)     Why is the number 21 pronounced twenty one  and 11 is not onety one? 
15)     ""I am."" is reportedly the shortest sentence  in the English language.  
Could it be that ""I do."" is the longest  sentence? 

16)     If lawyers are disbarred  and clergymen defrocked, doesn't it make sense that electricians can be  delighted, musicians denoted, cowboys deranged, models deposed, tree surgeons  debarked, and dry cleaners depressed?
17)     If FedEx and UPS were to  merge, would they call it Fed UP? 
18)     Do Lipton tea employees take coffee  breaks? 
19)     What  color do they put on the driver's licenses of bald men? 
20)     I was thinking about how people  seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it dawned on  me..........They're cramming for their final exam!
21)     I thought about how  mothers feed their babies with tiny little forks and spoons, so I wondered what  Chinese mothers use? Toothpicks?
22)     Why do they put pictures  of criminals up in the Post Office? What are we supposed to do, write to them?  Why don't they just put their pictures on the postage stamps so the mailmen  could look for them while they delivered the mail?
23)     If it's true that we are  here to help others, then what exactly are the others here for? 
24)     You never really learn to swear  until you learn how to drive. 
25)     No one ever says, ""It's only a game!"", when  their team is winning. 
26)     Do you ever wonder what the speed of  lightning would be if it didn't zigzag? 
27)     Last night I played a blank tape at full  blast. The mime next door went nuts! 
28)     If a cow laughed, would milk come out her  nose? 
29)     Whatever  happened to Preparations A through G?

June 06, 2001

""Celebrate weakness. Play the fool in your group or
your company by embracing inversion, absurdity, and
perseverance. Inverted thinking may help you leapfrog
the competition. And just think of the innovations that
rose from failure: Post-it Notes, the telephone, Silly
Putty, the lightbulb.""

JULY ISSUE: Sneak Preview

You Can Quote Him | by Charles Fishman

How to Stay on the Move ... When the Rest of the World
Is Slowing Down | by Scott Kirsner
It's hard to remember a less-inviting time to have a
great idea for a new company or to champion new ideas
to change a big company. But leaders who think big
aren't willing to downsize their ambitions -- they just
have to work harder (and smarter). Here's advice on how
to stay fast in slow times.

Innovations to Go | by Fara Warner
Sometimes it's the people who come late to a technology
that push the envelope. Here's how firefighters and
doctors learned to love their PDAs.

John Chambers, After the Deluge | by George Anders
How do you guide a legendary growth company through the
worst slump in its history? That's the challenge facing
Cisco's CEO. In an in-depth interview, Chambers
explains how to slow down smart, why the Internet still
matters, and what to do when your big customers stop
buying.

New on Fastcompany.com: On the Eve of Destruction?

On the Eve of Destruction? | by Keith H. Hammonds
""Creative Destruction"" argues that corporate survivors
must be flexible -- unconcerned by threats of
cannibalization, channel conflict, or earnings
dilution. In short, they must rethink the ""Built to
Last"" credo.

Bear Destroyed after Fatal Attack in Canada 
Compiled by Outside Online 
June 6, 2001 A black bear that attacked and killed a camper in Canada's Northwest Territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports.

Coroners determined that the bear shot yesterday was the same animal that mauled 18-year-old Kyle Harry on Saturday while he was camping with friends near Yellowknife. The bear had been shot by a RCMP officer at the scene of the attack on Saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear's chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer, a wildlife official told the London Free Press.

Harry and five other teens had camped overnight on Friday before four members of the group left early on Saturday morning, the London Free Press reports. Harry and a 14-year-old girl stayed behind and saw the bear come into their campground around noon. They pulled their food inside of their tent then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent. The girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car. Harry, caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge, was found dead by officials. A report yesterday by The Outdoor Network says the bear was feeding on Harry when officials arrived.

On Sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal, employing a helicopter and infrared scanner. Another bear shot on Monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack.

On July 2 of last year, 24-year-old Canadian biathlete Mary-Beth Miller was killed by a black bear while on a training run at the Myriam Bedard Biathlon Centre near Quebec City.

"RE: Hi!","I got back form Germany on Friday and have been trying to catch up with work
before our trip to Alaska.  We leave this Sunday the 10th.  Monique's
brother is going to watch the dogs while we're gone so don't worry about it.
It sounds like you've got your hands full.

It's great you're buying a house.  We just can't seem to figure out what we
want to do.  Monique is so stressed out with work right now I'm not sure how
much longer we'll be in Houston.

Did you get a good loan?  Did you get your truck yet?

Hi Worm,

How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!
What are the dates you are going to Alaska?
Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?
Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!
I have two offers on the table right now.
Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one
I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,
I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.
How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?
Let me know.
Love,
Jul

"belated hello and sorry for not calling you back","Monique,

I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend but
with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun and
you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I think
you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value you
what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm very
good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what is
happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a strange
way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are available,
respond by email when you can

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

joe

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!
