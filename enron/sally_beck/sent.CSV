Subject:	Solomon Smith Barney

Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  

Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally

"RE: Good morning","Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you liked the pictures.  We would love to have you here for the recital and to spend the night.  If you thought it would work, you could come over on Monday night and we could enjoy dinner together.  I could take the day off from work on Tuesday and we could do some fun things, before what would probably be a more rushed dinner Tuesday night before heading to Amanda's recital.  Then you could make your drive back on Wednesday after breakfast.  
Whatever works for you will be great, though.  

I am heading to Los Angeles tomorrow for the National Charity League National meeting.  Patti is sending you my flight and hotel info.  My Thursday night is open, and I will be getting with Sue that night.  She lives in Whittier, so not too far for her to come and pick me up.  I know that we will have a good time catching up.

Sally, thanks so much for your mailing-the pictures were wonderful especially  
good and really like the one of the three of you,  David, and Meagan!   
Dad and I feel that driving over for the Mother's Day brunch and then staying  
for the recital would be too long.  You are always so gracious about inviting  
us to your special events

"FW: Suggestions to help short term morale","
In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I can always count on Bob Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --Sally

Subject:	Suggestions to help short term morale

Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting.  

Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but how about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there. 

Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting. Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it. 

Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed. We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more. 

I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal and regular. 

Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted. 


Bob Superty

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

I will be coordinating the efforts around the subject priority identified at the Global Accounting Leadership Conference.  We will be identifying people to help on all five priorities depending on each group's needs and interests.

The elements of the ""attract and retain keyemployees"" priority include:  

	1.  resource planning and utilization across Global Accounting 
	2.  on-campus and experienced hire recruiting
	3.  career development (effective analyst program for Global Accounting; new hire orientation; career planning, etc)
	4.  performance management (applying the PRC process in Global Accounting; additional forms of rewards and 
	     recognition)
	5.  networking/social activities

1.  Which of these elements, if any, are of particular concern to your group?
2.  Is there a  particular person(s) you would like to assign to one, several or all of these elements?

I anticipate that the time requirements will not be significant (a few hours each week, depending on the number of elements addressed by an individual, with some weeks heavier and some weeks lighter).

Please let me know!  Thanks!

"Re: Costs","I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two ""test runs"" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas			Frank Vickers (East)
			Laura Luce (Central)
			Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives		Fred LaGrasta

Power		Dave Duran
			Ozzie Pagan
			Ed Baughman
			Bruce Shuckley 

Portland		Chris Calger

Calgary		Ladain

Mexico		Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally

"Re: Forecast for 2001","Got your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  

I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that.

Subject:	Forecast for 2001

Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it.

Subject:	New York Details

Sally,
I was able to list on the following flights.  James did the calculation for
the cost.  It will be $125.00 per ticket.  It is calculated with a $50.00
service charge + the tax on the highest coach ticket to New York, which I
believe was $1200.00 or so.  We listed James because if he travels up there
with us we can get a higher priority than traveling alone.  He probably will
just turnaround and return to Houston.

These flights seem to have the greatest possibility of getting a seat.  A
positive regarding the early arrival into New York is perhaps to catch some
after Christmas sales!!!.  The arrival is into Newark while the returning is
out of LaGuardia.  We can always change the times and/or airport, if we
check the flights the night before.  But I did remember that you had a salon
appointment on the 28th.  This would get us back rather early --8:40am.

Let me know if this works for you guys!!

"Energy Operations PRC","We have set Monday, June 11 for the date of our Operations PRC that will include employees that are supporting ENA, EGM and EIM.  You mentioned that your functional PRC will be set for sometime between June 7 and June 14.  It would certainly be best from my point of view if my PRC occurs prior to your functional PRC.  While a number of PRC meetings will be held within Operations during the week of June 4 in preparation for our June 11th meeting, that will be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across ENA, EGM and EIM operations.  

I thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations PRC meeting in setting the date for your meeting.  Please let me know as soon as a date has been set for your PRC.

"RE: UT Recruiting Update","Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with Dean May and the three scholarship recipients.  One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.  

I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!  You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.  

Planned invitees from Enron are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and Andrea Reed.  Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.  

Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner).  

Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.  Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of ""more senior"" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.  Lexi has checked with Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.  She is waiting for calls back from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey.  

Who would you like to include from Enron at the dinner from the names in bold above?  --Sally

I have put together a brief campus update, including all previous and future events for the fall recruiting season.  Changes to our original campus plan are noted on the attachment.  As you can see, I still need 3 interviewers for October 16th.

All of our events have been well-received on campus.  The presentations that we have given to various student organizations have been of great benefit to our recruiting effort.

Regarding our campus numbers, I intend for the following:
Full Time:
Round 1: interview 55 candidates
Round 2: interview 36 candidates
Super Saturday: invite 15 candidates
Target: hire 10 candidates

Interns:
Round 1: interview 14 candidates
Round 2: interview 8 candidates
Target: hire 5-6 interns

	Please let me know if you need anything else or if I can provide any additional information.

	Thank you!

I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.

All business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:

1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business responses.  

2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line (x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her line.

Subject:	Operational Risk Management


As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.  

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.   

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.  

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
	
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books""
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances 
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.  

Thanks,

Rick Buy

Sally,
Sorry it took me so long, but just landed back in New York since last
Monday.  Please accept my sincerest of thanks for fitting Jim and me into
your already hectic schedule. After chatting with Tom Wilbeck, I do believe
that Viviance is the right decision for Enron.  Simply, Tom led us to
believe that a true discovery audit regarding the focus, needs, and delivery
should take place.  We just finished the same for DELL...this has proven to
be quite beneficial, as a study overview does give everyone involved a
better understanding of the right product for a specific company culture.
Just throwing content on a screen doesn't ensure, successful retention.  Our
mission, of education first, enables greater performance in the end.
Hopefully during my next trip down we could take some time for lunch or
dinner.  Your call. All my best, and again, thank you.

"RE: Season's Greetings!","Thanks for your call a few weeks back.  Has been totally crazy here, with incredibly long hours over the last 6 to 8 weeks.  Today is my last day in the office until Monday, December 31.   I need the break!  Has been hard to squeeze in time to get ready for Christmas.  And we are hosting Tyler's 4th birthday party on Friday this week.  Christmas at home, as usual, and the Meagan and I will be off to New York the morning of December 26th with her friend Nicole and her mom.  We thought it would be a fun trip with our seniors!  Shopping, eating and seeing plays - will be back on the night of the 28th.  

Our upcoming trips are to Orlando for four days in early March with the high school drill team for nationals competition. Then spring break in mid-March in Telluride for our first family ski trip!  Hopefully we will all come back in one piece!

Have a wonderful Christmas and enjoy the sun in San Diego.  Christmas cards are coming - you may just receive yours after Christmas.  Mo is in town and will join us for dinner tomorrow night. Grapevine has it that she is skinny as a rail!  

College update:  Meagan got her applications in to UT, OU, SMU and TCU before November 1.  She has acceptance letters from OU and SMU in hand, and is waiting to hear from UT and TCU.  I have no idea what her decision will be!  

Our best to Paul and the girls.  --Sally

Howdy,

Seems like our companies have been getting more than their fair share of
business magazine covers lately -- BW had Enron last week and HP this week
-- it is interesting for me to feel so closely tied to some of the biggest
stories in the business community right now -- I'm thinking that you would
choose a word other than interesting!

This has been a fun holiday season for us -- I took Rebecca to the Festival
of Trees -- a fancy tree decorating fund raiser and The Nutcracker Ballet --
it was very nice for Boise.  Tomorrow is her school program and tomorrow
night I am taking her to the Botanical Gardens, which are decorated in
lights this time of year.  But her main goal is getting to Christmas day and
opening presents -- she drives me nuts asking to open presents 55 times a
day :-)  On the 26th we are heading to San Diego for 4 days in the sun -- hp
is pretty much shut down from Dec 24 - Jan 1 opening Jan 2nd.

Are your winter plans taking you to Salt Lake for the Olympics?  Paul and I
will be there Feb 12 -15 -- I have tickets to the men's short and long
figure skating event.  As you can imagine,  I am VERY excited.  Not too much
else planned for the winter -- if you and your family want to sneak away for
a winter ski trip, think about Sun Valley.  I'd love to set something up for
us all.....except Katherine....she just starting walking...not quite ready
for skis!

Take Care,
Stephanie

"Re: Costs","Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas			Frank Vickers (East)
			Laura Luce (Central)
			Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives		Fred LaGrasta

Power		Dave Duran
			Ozzie Pagan
			Ed Baughman
			Bruce Shuckley 

Portland		Chris Calger

Calgary		Ladain

Mexico		Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally

"RE: Followup Meeting","Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed. 

I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.  Jim seems busy with these issues.  

I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.  I have Bob Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.

"Management Team Changes","Thought you might be interested in these two changes.  Mary has actually been out of the office since late February.  All of her global database responsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his team, under Beth Apollo.  Mary's effectiveness on CommodityLogic had been lessened over time, and beginning with her absence in February I have relied on my business leads (Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens) for their evaluation of the NomLogic, ConfirmLogic and InvoiceLogic modules.  --Sally

Subject:	Management Team Changes

Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.  

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team.

"EOL Team Connection to Operations","I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously played by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.  --Sally

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.

Subject:	Global Standard on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston (and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James

Your list does not include any interns under Brent Price ( he is one of my direct reports as well).  I understood that he does have some summer interns.  Can you update this list for me to include his interns?  

Also, as of April 1, Sheri Thomas now reports to Andy Zipper in ENW, and not to me.  We included her on the distribution of resumes for summer interships since she originally was part of my team.  From this point forward, however, you should communicate directly with Sheri and Andy Zipper regarding Greg Carlson's internship.  I just want to make sure that nothing falls through the cracks for these interns as we make organizational changes.  .  Thanks.  --Sally

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operational Risk Management task force.  How does Tuesday, October 16th and the afternoon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?  Please let me know your schedule for both of these dates.  Most of the task force members have been identified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.  Sally Beck will identify representatives from these two areas.  I would also expect that other individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or resources or required.  

I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.  The agenda will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:

	Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - What's in and What's Out
	Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the group)
	     Develop Common Language
                 Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk
	     Role of this task force  - Strategy

I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.  We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operational risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.  

Thanks, 
Wanda Curry

"Update on ConfirmLogic","I assume that Kathryn has communicated this to you.  I have only read Kim's e-mail - I will talk with her later today.  --Sally

Subject:	Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Kim Theriot

Subject:	2001 Andersen Audits

Attached below are the 2001 Andersen business audits and the timeline for these audits and other work. Within this document, we have identified the EES owner(s) that will be involved in each business audit. The scope/objectives of each business audit have also been outlined.

Business Audit Approach
For each business audit, we plan to hold an opening and closing meeting with all key personnel involved for that project (includes business owners, CAO, EAS representative, and Andersen). The objectives of the opening meeting are to discuss specific audit areas, team members, key contacts, and to identify required EES documentation. The closing meeting will be critical as this is the final opportunity to ensure all facts surrounding any issues are agreed upon and initially discuss any action plans. Timing of the opening/closing meetings will be communicated by Andersen at a later date.

Please review the attached Andersen document to ensure the business owners have been properly identified. Please contact me with any revisions or other questions.

Thanks,
Misty

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

The attached file shows the detail of plan headcount for December 31, 1998 through 2001.  The only number that I still have a question about, is for EGM December 2001, the number I have in the file only represents the people moving into Networks from EGM (Brent's group).  I left a message with Tom Myers, to get the correct number.  
I have also added the graphs that we discussed, which show increase in headcount along with increase in deal counts.

Thanks for all your time in Houston and I'd be delighted to continue discussions around commercialisation whenever you want.

As promised, please find attached examples of our monthly management reporting.  They are still evolving - at the moment they are missing aged debtors / creditors reporting (we should get in for June reporting once the function moves back into my area) and anything on Enron Credit.  However, comments and thoughts welcome!

Subject: Unify Operational Status


Here is a summary of Unify operations for today.  My plan was to provide these reports to this audience through the end of this week, and then pick up again during next bid week.  I'll be glad to continue this type of reporting moving forward, please let me know if you are interested.  Alternatively, I could move to a weekly reporting of issues, and/or change the audience of this report.  Your feedback on the matter is appreciated.
 
Summary of 9/28:
Heavy activity in the Gas system, especially in the afternoon.  System performance dropped during the afternoon, but no downtime was experienced. 
At just after 3:00 pm, a network server experienced problems and as a result one of our EDI servers was unable to accept new files.  No EDI files could be sent to our hub as a result.  As it turns out, the Infrastructure team was in the process of performing a critical re-synchronization on that server, and the server was unable to write new data to disk for over an hour (during re-synchronization this window is typically just a few minutes).  Infrastructure typically conducts resynchronizations after-hours, but resynchronization had failed on this box on several prior attempts, so the issue had become critical.  At 4:26 pm, the re-synchronization completed and all EDI files in the queue were processed normally, and our 5:00 pm intraday nom deadline was met.  
Action Items:
The network servers referenced are to be decommissioned on October 5th, and will be replaced with newer more reliable servers.  This is part of a planned project within the Infrastructure team. 
I have discussed the issue with the Infrastructure team and communicated our various intra-day processing deadlines.  They have committed to notifying the Unify team in the event future emergency-type maintenance is required during business hours. 
On the Power side, we have caught up on all of our processing that was delayed as a result of yesterday's outage.

Bill

This problem is stemming from the volume in Mass Market as you know.  As a result, significantly more new transactions are being booked to ""New Counterpart""  than can be cleaned up from historical deals.  As Credit has been emphasizing for some months now, this is not acceptable for this business, is not maintainable (proof in the attached report) and IT resources are required to automate current manual processes.

Global Counterparty is testing their new process to automate the set up of new counterparts in GCP such that the GCP ID may also be returned to EES in conjunction with our credit response prior to booking (expected delivery next Monday0.   However, the risk system batch process specifically for RPS must be enhanced to automatically create the counterpart and accept the GCP ID.  Efforts are finally underway to this end and are expected to be tested within the week.  Then, downstream processing through to billing may benefit.

Many lack the clear understanding that it has taken not only GCP to set up the counterpart in Global Counterpart but also Deal Capture to establish and map the counterpart in RPS and RGS (both have been manual procesess, the latter severly under resourced).  

Once this is implemented, EES has over 20,000 Mass Market transactions executed now, so efforts need to continue to clean up this backlog.  More importantly, three companies have already filed bankruptcy.  We must complete these efforts to manage the portfolio and respond to these events.

Regards
Molly

"RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep","In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

Subject: Unify Operational Status


Summary of 9/25:
No major issues were encountered with Unify gas, other than periods of poor performance in the afternoon. 
On Unify power, we are experiencing performance degradation with our deal load process.   The process is now taking 6 hours, whereas in the past it would complete in 2 hours.  We restarted SQL Server on the evening of the 24th, but deal load performance did not improve on the 25th. 
We experienced a major issue with Unify power whereby our replication from Enpower was down for nearly an entire day.  We were made aware of the problem at roughly 5:00 p.m.  We notified all users to exit the system, restarted SQL Server and our database server (as previously planned), and were caught up at 10:00 pm.  We then started our planned nightly processing, but deal load performance did not improve.  We are working with the DBA team to improve notification in the event our replication processes are down. 
 
Summary of 9/26:
Unify gas performance was spotty during the morning under heavy usage.  We discovered a report being run in our production environment was contributing to our performance problems.  We will (again) reinforce the need to use the reporting database for such reporting in the future.  
Our Sitara bridge experienced significant backlogs at roughly 2:00 pm.  Upon investigation, we were receiving another SQL Server error (not the buffer latch error) which seems to indicate that processes were ""sleeping"" while waiting for system resources to free.  At that time, the Sitara bridge process was consuming a tremendous amount of system processes so we stopped that process (after consulting with Bob Superty).  Other processes in waiting immediately began executing normally, and we started the bridge roughly 30 minutes later. 
 
  
Summary of Critical Unify Operational Issues:
Issue
Status
Next Steps
Buffer latch errors with SQL Server have caused us to bring down Unify during business hours.
Open
Microsoft will not deliver a fix to us by October as planned.  They have discovered that the problem is an architectural issue with SQL Server, and will require additional time to fix.  In the interim, they will provide us with diagnostic tools which may help us predict when the buffer latch error will surface.
Database locks are causing performance problems.
Open
As previously stated, we have changed our pre-emptive maintenance thresholds, and are working on other refinements of our ongoing maintenance efforts.  We are also closely monitoring database activity to locate programs which are contributing to this problem.
Power Deal Load processing is degrading each month.  As a result, our end of month processes are bleeding over into normal business hours and causing additional performance problems.
Open
We have analyzed our deal load process in detail, and are performing a significant re-work.  Our plan is to have the process streamlined by October's end of month processing.

"FW: Suggestions to help short term morale","I am forwarding this message to you sent to me by Bob Superty.  Bob is the director of Gas Logistics for Enron Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can always count on Bob to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  Here are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader Enron Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an Enron-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.  I could certainly use some help, however.  

You may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like Bob Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in Enron Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.  

Your thoughts?  --Sally

Subject:	Suggestions to help short term morale

Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting.  

Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but how about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there. 

Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting. Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it. 

Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed. We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more. 

I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal and regular. 

Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted.

Dear Kim:

The CommodityLogic team presents ConfirmLogic to Enron for the beta program, which Enron will be a key participant. The following are the current parameters for how the system will perform during this program.

Negative Confirmation
?If deal status is 'Pending' and current date is 3 business days past the post date; ConfirmLogic changes deal status from 'Pending' to 'Confirmed'. 


Updating Existing Deals
?No restrictions on updates - counterparties can send deal changes at any time for any deal.

	
Viewing Confirmed Deals
?ConfirmLogic allows view-only capability to deals that have been confirmed (user cannot post inquiry or add deal number).

Deal Types Offered
?ConfirmLogic will be offering the following deal types:  
Financial Natural Gas: Swaps, Gas Daily Swap, Options, Gas Daily Options Swaptions
Financial Power: Swaps, Options, Swaptions
Physical Power: Forwards, Index Forwards, Options, Swaption 

During the beta program the following open issues related to the system functionality will be discussed with our beta clients in order to establish an industry standard.  The goal will be to modify the system with the final business rules for the commercial release.  Enron will participate in the discussion and decision making process during the program.

Negative Confirmation
?Mirror industry standard and apply same rule for all deal types.
	
Expiration of Inquired Deals
?Expire inquired deals when no actions have been taken for a defined period of time.


Updating Existing Deals  
?Allow updates and develop method for defining intent of information published to CommodityLogic.


Agreement on Other Terms
?Assumed agreement for terms not presented in ConfirmLogic in place between counterparties before committing to use module.





Regards, 
Kathryn Cordes, ModuleManager ConfirmLogic

"Enron Net Works - Global Risk Management Operations","TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected
FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:

Rick:  Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are ""baked enough"" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in light of revised plans for the various business units?  My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.  Which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the ENW budget.  
 
Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the ENW budget, if necessary.  Thanks.  --Sally

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally

"Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations","The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  

		29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk 

		30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products) 

		31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams
		
		32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis

				 
		37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services 						
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES (my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.    All of these of course with top priority!

My understanding is that this falls under the normal Enron Educational assistance program and we don't have to get any other approvals.

Is this the correct approach?

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.

HR should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details.  

The year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses.  It is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data.

"Astros Tickets 2001 Season","Patti will be distributing Astros tickets to you for the 2001 season.  We used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number of employees on your team.  I hope that you will enjoy the games and that you will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job well done.  

We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to Patti, who scoped out options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, about 28 rows up from the field.  Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last year!  We will work on the aisle for next  year.  We also still have the two Terrace level tickets as we did last year.  For some games you will get all 6 tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace tickets.  

Not a bad start to the season so far, so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is history!  --Sally

Subject:	Where Are We?   EES Settlements 

When I sent this e:mail on Monday, I committed two things for this week:  a preliminary review of our more detailed plan with the traders (Belden, Black, Presto and Rogers) by mid week and a final proposal of roles and responsibilitiies by the end of this week to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  It is 4:30 pm Friday, and as far as I can tell we have not delivered on either commitment this week.  I didn't hear from the three of you that you couldn't make these time commitments, so I did not reset expectations.  

We must need to reset expectations now.  Can we plan to complete this by Monday afternoon (June 11th) so that I can get back with all interested parties that attended the June 4 lunch meeting?  Do the four of us need to meet briefly this afternoon ( I will stay as late as necessary) or on Monday morning to clarify what needs to be done?  How can I help move this forward?  This topic commanded an hour and a half of Delainey and Lavorato's time at lunch on the 4th, so it is important to them.  --Sally

Subject:	EES Settlements - Follow Up

As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --Sally   (x35926)

Subject:	Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  

		29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk 

		30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products) 

		31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams
		
		32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis

				 
		37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services 						
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Sally,

Someone brought up an interesting idea that might help motivate people and retain them.  Recognizing that we are constrained from a cash perspective, does it make any sense to still promote some people who deserve it so that at least they get recognition in terms of title and recognition by their peers, however have their salary remain the same?

Just a thought.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Subject:	Mid/Back office objectives

A near term goal for mid/back office commercialization is as follows:

First, we need to determine what each piece is in the mid/back office that can be commercialized and how we would separate these different pieces.  In other words, how we separate risk reporting and general ledger and where we put it at Enron.  How we put the physical gas nominations and power scheduling at the desks.  How we take the rest for gas and power (and/or financial) and create ProcessCo/ServiceCo as a separate entity or within Net Works.

Second, once we know the different pieces, can we separate them from a systems perspective ( I am assuming that separating people is straightforward)?

Third, assuming we can separate things, how we communicate back to the other parts.  In other words, how we communicate information back to Enron's SAP system, how we settle for Enron if they want ProcessCo to do physical settlements, how we receive information so we can deal capture and confirm, etc.  All the linkages.

Fourth, how we create an agreement between ProcessCo and EWS that defines payments, service levels, term, etc. that can be a model for other companies as well.

Fifth, how this all deals with CommodityLogic and its business model.

Sixth, if we go alone or work with someone like Arcordia (after Beth's meeting).

Finally, how we originate these deals and charge for our service.

I know that alot of this is being done in different parts on different time schedules, but I would like to get it all pulled together soon in the following format:

A draft of a contract between EWS and ProcessCo (or Net Works).  Also, a clear picture of what systems and functions would be in this entity.  Also, a recommendation on how Enron maintains its risk reporting and general ledger as well as physical noms and scheduling and where that stays in Enron and how those functions work with ProcessCo.

Sheri Thomas, Jeff Harbert, Frank Davis, Fred Philipson, and Andrea Crump are now full time reporting to Tom on commercialization, all have mid/back office experience and can help Beth and Sally with alot of this work before Tom comes back from his cruise at the end of next week.

Let's discuss Monday.

Thanks.

"Services Company","Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one of our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured into Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that there could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during November and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people), but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enron that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to ""win again"" as Enron.  

Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could provide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  With the potential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron employees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this ""independent"" services company to provide services.  Servicing the Enron Estate could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon the structure of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced costs for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true career opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained.  

Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.  We asked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, and I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this.  Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our hope would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted.  

The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consideration.  Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  It would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal.  If we as Enron felt that there is merit to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Creditor's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting firm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process.  

Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --Sally

"Re: FW: Costs/Mid Back office commercialization","Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I will meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to ""mass mail"" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we need one.    

Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to deliver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the other ""out of towner"" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I can discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch tomorrow.  

I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  --Sally

Why don't you and Rahil agree on the draft ASAP and then let Rahil send it out in draft form this Friday afternoon to all these individuals for their review and comments.  Rahil can work with these people directly next week on their comments.  Rahil is free from the day-to-day operations issues and has the time to push the product menu to the EA Originators.

We can still set up an offsite to finalize, but we need to get something out because these individuals are already out selling as we speak.

Shukaly resigned and left.

But I assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that whoever they want can attend. 

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letting them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One on ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We need to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

Subject:	Re: Costs   

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas			Frank Vickers (East)
			Laura Luce (Central)
			Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives		Fred LaGrasta

Power		Dave Duran
			Ozzie Pagan
			Ed Baughman
			

Portland		Chris Calger

Calgary		Ladain

Mexico		Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally

"Today's Meeting on Curve Validation","Our curve validation process is one of the key items that Arthur Andersen will be reviewing at year end.  AA has looked for us to strengthen this process, and Tom Bauer stated about 6 weeks ago that he would be looking closely at this.  (His focus may now have been diverted, but I would also anticipate that AA's reviews will have a new intensity about them!)  

In preparation for this, I have called a meeting today with the risk leads across all commodities.  I want to hear from them in a protected environment today what they are and are not doing regarding curve validation.  We will review the recent changes recommended regarding curve validation (from the task force lead by Shona Wilson) and discuss specific action steps to insure that we demonstrate an improved curve validation process.  I have a meeting with Shawn Kilcrest and Tom Bauer later this week and, following today's meeting, I hope to give them assurances about progress that has or will be made.  

You are welcome to join us in this meeting.  If you do not attend, please get with your respective risk leads later today or tomorrow so that you are aware of the current status of curve validation in your area and any improvements that may need to be made quickly.  

The meeting will be held as follows:  	3:00 - 3:30 PM 
					ECS  4102 (my office) 

Attendees:	Jeff Gossett
		Stacey White
		Sam Leuschen
		Scott Mills

"HPL Close","The decision was made last Friday that June 1 would be the closing date for the sale of HPL to AEP (there had been some discussion about moving the close date to July 1).  Brian Redmond has compiled a list of action items to be completed before the close.  Bob Hall is leading this effort for operations and we do not anticipate any problems meeting the June 1 date.  As I explained earlier, our involvement will continue with HPL through June, as invoicing and cash collection for the production month of May will be handled in June.  After the end of June, their may be some involvement on our part in following up on any unpaid invoices or answering customer questions regarding activity prior to June 1.  The effort on our part should diminish substantially after June 30.

Sally,

After some phone calls today, I learned that I was deleted from the attendee list for May 16 and 17.  However, they stretched and admitted me.  Because of the ""late"" entry, the process for soliciting feedback is different than other attendees.  I provided my list today, and as I understand it, they will be sending the solicitation via E-mail to you.

Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Thanks for your feedback.

Guys,

Just wanted to send you a note of congratulations, given Q3 EES results  - you are and will continue to be a key and integral component to the success and growth of EES. 

I know there is a lot of heavy lifting and difficult decisions but I do believe we are starting to put a dent in the issues.  At the same time, we are developing a significant franchise of which Enron can be proud.  

Thank you

"RE: Operational Risk Management","Rick:  

Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk.  We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involved in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.  Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the ""wholesale businesses"", or is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide?  

I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complementing, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being piloted in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA audits, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the various operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other Thursday with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cover this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo.  

I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilities at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quantifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the implementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implementation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-developed operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unit/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be formed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but may not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatives.  

Finally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being addressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure that information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate and efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spanning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, resource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of stakeholders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for final input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for Debbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed plan and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate to take this item off of the Wanda's list.  We can certainly update the cross-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new team to focus on this bullet point.

Subject:	Operational Risk Management


As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.  

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.   

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.  

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
	
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books""
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances 
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.  

Thanks,

Rick Buy

"Budget Process Update","EIM's budget meeting with Lay/Whalley/Frevert has been moved from Wednesday, October 24 to Monday, November 5.  Kerry Roper sent you an e-mail message today with revised dates for budget reviews.  

McMahon is out of town today, and Ray Bowen's preference is to push the review of our revised ENW budget for EIM back to Wednesday (tomorrow).  I am coordinating with Kent Castleman on this meeting with Ray and will give you an update tomorrow after the meeting with Ray.  Kent believes that our current allocations are now acceptable to EIM.  They will okay the current EOL allocation, but are also very interested in the revised allocation methodology.  

Brent has had to unexpectedly drive to Austin this afternoon to lecture to a class at UT - a Rick Causey commitment that Rick asked Brent to fill today.  When Brent is back tomorrow we will regroup on the EGM budget with the intent of sign-off from Mike and Jeff by end of day tomorrow or Thursday.  

Whalley budget update - I reviewed this with Kerry today.  I suggested that on the Whalley recap sheet that we footnote that numbers were as of 10/22/01, and represented final agreement on EA charges, and revised charges (subject to final sign-off) for EIM.  The footnote should also say final reviews with EES and EGM are expected this week, so ENW charges to those business units are still preliminary.  I also suggested to Kerry that we footnote for Whalley the break-out and total (expense and capital) of budget reductions since our review with Whalley 10 days ago.  --Sally

Teresa,

Pursuant to a discussion you had with Debbie Brackett last month regarding manual wires not process through SAP impacts the return of collateral a great deal.   It is very important that these manual wires be processed immediately in order for us to receive the correct feeds from SAP and calculate the correct net exposures for each counterparty.

Today, Melissa Ratnala confirmed that we made a manual payment to Reliant Energy Services on October 10th in the amount of $57MM.  Unfortunately, we were not advised of the payment and it was not reflected in the SAP feeds.  This resulted in Reliant holding $57MM collateral for an additional 12 days.  The management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate information, in order to manage our daily cash position.  

Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made.  

How can we resolve this issue promptly?


Thanks,

"In the spirit of cooperation...","John is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunately occur rather frequently.  When he cited the reason for performance issues in his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being handled during normal business hours.  Here is his response.  I bring this to your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.  I know that everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we have to stay closely coordinated.  I know that EOL has a dedicated member of your team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issues that could or do touch EOL.  Is there anyone assigned from your team for a similar role with our critical operating systems?  Because of nomination deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify, it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's performance is impaired.  Let me know if you can assign someone from the infrastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Unify.  Thanks.  --Sally

Unfortunately, we didn't get a notification - we played detective.
 
In their defense, they had tried to do the resynchronization after-hours a couple of times and it failed, so they were somewhat desperate to get this done.  Nonetheless, a phone call should have been made to our team in advance.

Subject: Unify Operational Status
Here is a summary of Unify operations for today.  My plan was to provide these reports to this audience through the end of this week, and then pick up again during next bid week.  I'll be glad to continue this type of reporting moving forward, please let me know if you are interested.  Alternatively, I could move to a weekly reporting of issues, and/or change the audience of this report.  Your feedback on the matter is appreciated.
 
Summary of 9/28:
?         Heavy activity in the Gas system, especially in the afternoon.  System performance dropped during the afternoon, but no downtime was experienced. 
?         At just after 3:00 pm, a network server experienced problems and as a result one of our EDI servers was unable to accept new files.  No EDI files could be sent to our hub as a result.  As it turns out, the Infrastructure team was in the process of performing a critical re-synchronization on that server, and the server was unable to write new data to disk for over an hour (during re-synchronization this window is typically just a few minutes).  Infrastructure typically conducts resynchronizations after-hours, but resynchronization had failed on this box on several prior attempts, so the issue had become critical.  At 4:26 pm, the re-synchronization completed and all EDI files in the queue were processed normally, and our 5:00 pm intraday nom deadline was met.  
Action Items:
o        The network servers referenced are to be decommissioned on October 5th, and will be replaced with newer more reliable servers.  This is part of a planned project within the Infrastructure team. 
o        I have discussed the issue with the Infrastructure team and communicated our various intra-day processing deadlines.  They have committed to notifying the Unify team in the event future emergency-type maintenance is required during business hours. 
?         On the Power side, we have caught up on all of our processing that was delayed as a result of yesterday's outage.

Subject:	Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  

		29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk 

		30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products) 

		31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams
		
		32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis

				 
		37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services 						
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Dear Ms. Villanueva,

Your iBuyit Security Request Form arrived with no roles, such as 'Employee' or 'Approver,'  checked. Unfortunately, we are unable to begin processing Mr. Price's request until we receive a copy of the iBuyit Security.doc with his choices noted in the appropriate check boxes. Please, resubmit the form with the desired  choices checked. 

Furthermore, to facillitate the rapid and smooth processing of this Security Request Form, you should be aware that those requesting the user role of ""Approver"" must have their supervisor email the request to us AND that the Supervisor must state, in the body of the email, that the request is appoved.

Thanks,
Karen

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.

"Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process","The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Subject:	RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  

Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight.

Pretty huge cuts,   I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from other areas).  This is probably all the detail I'll require.  Let me have your final numbers when you can.  Obviously if there are any senior position changes I think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who they like or not.

We do want to run the business as is, I think the big difference is new IT projects, we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale.  On Operations I think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is no longer required - we need to just get back to where we were.

Subject:	Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

Sally,  it doesn't appear that the fax machines already in ECS will be sufficient for your needs.  Let me know if you would like us to assist your group in getting additional fax machines.  I have to believe that there are numerous excess machines around here.   JR

Jenny --

There are 25 owned and 6 leased fax machines on ECS 05 & 06 per the UBS asset scheduled.  After doing a walk though on the floors, the machines are concentrated in certain business areas.  Current machine placement will not accommodate the type of usage that I suspect Sally's group will need to have.

My suggestion is that the settlements group(s) bring their fax machines with them, and we have the numbers changed.

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

David

I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  

 I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one.

Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.

"RE: Fun Yet??","I think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York, a lifetime or two ago!!  

Sounds as if your rollercoaster experience with Teddy was perhaps a preview of the subsequent weeks at Enron.  Thank goodness for those little guys to go home to every night.  

My little guys aren't so little any more.  Meagan is a senior this year - had all of her college applications submitted by November 1, and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done.  She has gotten one acceptance - University of Oklahoma.  She also applied to UT, SMU and TCU and is waiting to hear from them.  She may hear from SMU and TCU before Christmas - UT probably after the first of the year.  (By the way, David and I are strongly talking up the state school thing, given the current Enron share price, or diminished portion thereof.)  This senior year is going by all too quickly, especially since the last month or so I seem to be hearing about it second-hand having spent way too many hours in the Enron Building.

And mentioning the building, I moved to Enron Center South (the new building) in mid September.  I'm on the 4th floor - one of the trading floors.  Kinneman is on this floor, too.  Kind of a cool building, but weird because it is not really finished.  Our floor is fine, but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator - and some elevators are ""panelled"" with rough plywood inside.   The sky ring thing is cool, too, but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space.  We walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down.  Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate, but we are here!  

Do let me know if you are going to be in Houston anytime soon.  I would love to get together with you.  Between 9/11 and our current cash constraints,  my previously planned November London visit is not happening!  

Enjoy your Thanksgiving in London.  --Sally

 To answer your question, I went to Euro Disney in october and I am scared of rollercoasters.  However, Teddy being 8 years old, I had to go on them.  I found Space Mountain (roller coaster in the dark) much easier to handle than a similar one where I actually could see the danger that I was putting myself in.
 
While it must be difficult for your people, they could do a lot worse than have you in charge.  Good luck with this situation.  I hope to speak to you soon.

Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  

Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight.

Pretty huge cuts,   I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from other areas).  This is probably all the detail I'll require.  Let me have your final numbers when you can.  Obviously if there are any senior position changes I think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who they like or not.

We do want to run the business as is, I think the big difference is new IT projects, we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale.  On Operations I think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is no longer required - we need to just get back to where we were.

Subject:	Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

Paul,

Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work and responsibility these days.

Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever increasing transaction flow.

In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would like to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team what we mean by ""outsourcing"" your mid and back office functions to our ""ProsessCo/ServiceCo.""  I think we have identified what types of services we could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically, you have risk reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation, nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and cash payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it hopefully makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to accomodate your growing business instead of you building it from scratch.  

I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on security/neutrality, comparable service levels to Enron, term and the ability to do financial easier than physical.  We can go through all that as well.

I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

Let me know your thoughts.

Piper

Subject:	Industrial Markets

Industrial Markets (led by Bruce Garner in Europe and Jeff McMahon worldwide) is expecting significant growth this year.  

Jeff and Bruce expect that by year end, they will have approximately 45 commercial people in Europe and will need significant support for their efforts.

This is a very exciting new business area for us in Europe and we need to ensure that they have sufficient resource dedicated to help them in their efforts.  Could each of you sit down with Bruce and agree the resource which will be dedicated to his group.  As a base proposition, all resources should be sourced out of Europe and each group must have at least one person who is accountable to Bruce for support.  Costs will be re-charged in the normal way.

Please let Jeff and I know what is agreed and call me if there are any difficulties.

Thanks.

Michael

"RE: New RC for Calgary Risk","I don't recall making this request.  Who did you hear this from?  Maybe that person could shed light on this for both of us. 

There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn't match the organizational name that is used for your group.  I wonder if that is where this is coming from?  Norma (whose last name I don't know) who works for Robert Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.  The RC name that was used had ""IBS"" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously seem to relate to your team.  Question was whether or not this RC reported in through Operations.  When I asked Norma to read me the names of employees in that RC, it included Kathy Reeves and her team.  I told her that we had not used the term ""IBS"" in a while.  Norma asked if the RC name should be consistent with the organizational name of the group.  I said that makes sense and she said she would follow up on that.  But that should have been a name change, not the opening of a new cost center.  See if any of this info gets us back on the right track.  --Sally

"RE: Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process","In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with Rick Causey.  The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.  When I explained our budgeting process to Rick Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.  Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.  --Sally

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Teresa,

Pursuant to a discussion you had with Debbie Brackett last month regarding manual wires not process through SAP impacts the return of collateral a great deal.   It is very important that these manual wires be processed immediately in order for us to receive the correct feeds from SAP and calculate the correct net exposures for each counterparty.

Today, Melissa Ratnala confirmed that we made a manual payment to Reliant Energy Services on October 10th in the amount of $57MM.  Unfortunately, we were not advised of the payment and it was not reflected in the SAP feeds.  This resulted in Reliant holding $57MM collateral for an additional 12 days.  The management of cash collateral is extremely important and we need accurate information, in order to manage our daily cash position.  

Please advise of any other counterparty that manual wires were made.  

How can we resolve this issue promptly?


Thanks,

"McKinsey, Staff Meeting and Budget Updates","McKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  Todd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.  


Staff Meeting Attendees:  Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including Mark's directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or Alan announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start.  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition.)  

Budgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that Greg is trying to make.  Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some ideas on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.  --Sally

My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally

"RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoughts","Realistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas and power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be considered in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing fees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - should be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit sponsor and ENW agree upon.  

While we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship between the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the EOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then whenever John Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad hoc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and price accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether the request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get me and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envelope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly work every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insure success for EA.  That is what John and Louise should want.  Push us back too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully dedicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.  It is kind of ironic.  I think that Enron is pleased with how I've managed operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make sure that this works for Enron.  I have some really good people who are very motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewed as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work hard to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contributor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly because they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their business in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you kind of wonder... 

I am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took this role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of circumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the service provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lower costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, but going too far may produce the wrong answer for Enron.  --Sally

Subject:	RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions - Per transaction thoughts 

I have been thinking alot about this per transaction thing.  

ENW provides three very different types of services to Enron.  The first, EnronOnline, is very collaborative and is very much an application building and operating situation.  No one at Enron is looking to outsource EOL functionality.  Creativity in that application is driven by the desks and ENW in a marriage every hour of every day.   If it goes down for a minute, traders are panicked and the news wires start pumping out that it is down.  I am not in favor of any relationship on EOL that would drive any kind of arms length wedge between us and any other group.  If my revenue is not large enough on EOL, do I let service slip?  What is a new function and feature request that fits in the contract?  Do I do change orders?  What is an EOL change order?  I think EOL is an allocation relationship.

IT infrastructure is something that could be outsourced.  It was once and it didn't work very well and we pulled it back in.  If we outsourced it, how would EDS or IBM or someone like that price that service to us?  By a per transaction charge?  Not likely.  On this one, we can charge exactly like it was outsourced to them by charging per desk top, putting depreciation in a $/month charge, having them select their level of service on controllable, etc.  That would be up to Mark and Jenny.

So let's get down to what really is a service related to transactions and that is fulfillment and the operations and IT associated with that.  Let's say we went per transaction on that in some fixed and variable form.  Once again, the pain will come around negotiating levels of service and eliminating the flexibility for them to change quickly.   We will also have issues since we have shared systems and EIM and EGM may not want to pay per transaction.

I am against per transaction for EOL, I am OK pricing something like any other service company would price on IT infrastructure, but I think we should only consider per transaction on the fulfillment portion.

Your thoughts?

Subject:	RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions 

Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The schedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate two hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting that Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs through the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a religious holiday, I decided to ""skip out"" from this meeting to be here on Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets together.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orchestrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW meeting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise. 

Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets together, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us.  

We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our ""scope of engagement"" discussion.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for discussion on that.    --Sally

I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows: 

Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees 

Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop,
											Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA
											Operations, including Calgary)
	
Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering,
											Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)

Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)

			3 - 4pm		EB3314		ENW: Operations & IT Dev.	Wes Colwell,Faith Killen, Louise 
											Kitchen,Sally Beck, Beth Perlman,
											Mark Pickering, Greg Piper, Kerry
											Roper, Bob Hall (added-EA 												Operations) 

I look forward to reviewing details with you in each of these meetings.  --Sally

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

Subject:	Operations PRC Meeting

Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.  At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.  On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager.  Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team) 

You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.  I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.  

My team is also included in a funtional PRC meeting that is held by Rick Causey.  In that meeting we review director level and above.  Rick has not set the date for that meeting.

I am assuming one of you comes initially - you or Bob.  We don't mind someone coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.  What do you think?

Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest. 

With regard to your comment that I am ""in"", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  

Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.

Barry is in Accounting for now, Jim wants him for the estate.  All of that was before you were in.  I had to plan.  I think Barry is an asset - Wes and I don't know where though.  Any thoughts?

Bob is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under Bob in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  

Also, I talked with Bob Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with Barry Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --Sally

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.  The ""i's"" don't have to be dotted nor the ""t's"" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.

I know that in our meeting with Rick and Rick we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.

"Hold the Date","Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of Beth's arrival and Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for you.

Wes asked me to pull the above group together to discuss the who, and the mechanics of how, people from each of our respective EES groups move over to EWS as part of the reorganization underway.  It would probably be a good idea to bring copies of your most up-to-date org. charts (Wade, Wanda and Kalen).

I will have my assistant, Jennifer Bryan, contact your assistants to schedule a time that fits.  Wes indicated he would like to have this meeting Monday or Tuesday of next week.

If you have any questions, please do not hesistate to call.

Thanks

Wade

"Solomon Smith Barney","Mike Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of Frank Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within Solomon Smith Barney.  

I told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve Bob Hall, Jeff Gossett, Stacey White, Leslie Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  

Mike says that Wes is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with Wes to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    

Is this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --Sally

Guys,

Just wanted to send you a note of congratulations, given Q3 EES results  - you are and will continue to be a key and integral component to the success and growth of EES. 

I know there is a lot of heavy lifting and difficult decisions but I do believe we are starting to put a dent in the issues.  At the same time, we are developing a significant franchise of which Enron can be proud.  

Thank you
Dave

This definitley does not sound like HPL.  I will ask around and see if anyone knows anything.  

However, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of conference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are approxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong to AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gilley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and removing the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs for the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team of contractors to complete this.

No.  We did have HPL boxes over that at one time and Carolyn Gilley and Earl Johnson managed the process but both are no longer here.  Can we get more specific information as to the contents and whether they are labled as HPL or not?

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

David

"Enron Net Works - Cost Savings","We are prepared to get with you as soon as you would like after your return from New York to review projected cost savings from ENW.  For each business unit that we support (EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS), we have prepared cost savings on expense and capital based on the three scenarios below.  

	Scenario 1:	Enron exits the line of business, with immediate headcount reductions and cost savings quantified;
			skeleton staff remains for orderly exit of business; then final headcount reductions and cost
			savings quantified (Lights Out)

	Scenario 2:	Enron retains and maintains line of business, but does not invest for growth; assumes no further systems 
			enhancements; support is scaled back from current level and is minimal (Lights On - But Dim)

	Scenario 3:	Enron retains line of business and invests modestly to accommodate known market changes; service levels 
			are scaled back from current level and are a step above minimal (Lights On - Brighter) 

Cost savings in all three scenarios have been quantified at the following level of detail by commodity for EGM and EIM:

	EGM:	Freight Markets					EIM:	Forest Products
		FX/IR/Equity						Steel
		Domestic Crude & Products
		International Crude & Products
		Domestic Coal
		International Coal

Cost savings have been identified for ENW's unallocated expense and capital as well.  We have worked with HR to adjust cost savings for anticipated severance costs.

Help!

It appears that EOL is being given out to people who have not received authorization to trade.  The latest is someone reporting up through Jean Mrha. (John Grass)  Why doesn't RAC require that anyone requesting authorization to get EOL get approved through RAC.  I'm sure Lavo doesn't know (or maybe he does) that we have yet another unauthorized trader to rein in.

Any suggestions?

"Several Updates","Thanks to those of you who attended the ENW all-employee meeting today.  It was great to see Brent, Bob and Kevin upfront and center.  All of you must have done a great job in reminding, encouraging, arm-twisting or forcing your teams to attend, because the ballroom was full!  

A morning meeting means that our logistics schedulers can't attend.  So we have reserved EBN 5C2 for Friday, October 12 from 2:00 to 3:00 so that we can show the videos and walk through the slides with the schedulers.  If a few others who missed today's meeting want to join, there should be room.

Thanks for the feedback so far on staff members to participate with Melissa Becker on one of the follow-ups from Causey's offsite - Attracting and Retaining Good People.  If you still have someone from your staff that would like to participate, please send me their names by Tueday next week.  

Golf on Monday, November 19?  Let me know early next week if you would like for a foursome from your team (could certainly include you!) to play in the afternoon tournament at Raveneaux Country Club.  If you have some team members who have worked hard on a project or put in some unusually long hours for you, this could be a nice reward.  Did I mention that David is in charge of this tournament?  

I will be out of the office on Monday, October 8.  Meagan and I will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  I hope that the streets will be ORANGE when I get there.  I will have my cell phone with me, if anything critical comes up.  I will be back in the office on Tuesday.  Have a great weekend!  --Sally

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

Subject:	Employee retention

Sally, Bob - just a thought about where we currently are and how we help maintain solid leadership for the future. As I looked around the room at your breakfast meeting today it appeared many of the people in important management roles were probably at an age where they would like to stay at Enron, work hard and hopefully be able to take care of immediate family needs (college, etc.) and then retire with a enough to enjoy their elder years. Others were probably at an age where career changes are in their plans so it's the quick hits that will make a difference. Maybe the mix was 50/50. Clearly I'm in the former category. Several people at the meeting commented about the severe impact the current situation has had on their retirement plans and how the time left to make this up is a concern. In my relatively short time here (3 1/4 years) I have made the following observation. Enron has a great Associate and Analyst program and these employees contribute immediately to the company. In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce that provides great flexibility and energy to our efforts. No doubt this has led to the great success over the years. However at the end of the day the business requires a level of maturity and experience that very effectively complements this young and very talented workforce. Helps pull things together and keep the sanity. In many cases this translates to employees in their mid to later years of their work life. During the good times no problem as bonus $'s and other vehicles take care of things. However we are possibly in a situation where those are limited or reduced to some extent for some extended period of time.  

Question: Do we need to do something positive, send a signal, to our middle aged and more senior employees that we understand the importance and value you add to the company and are willing to take a look at our pension/retirement plans. When we come out of this current situation what will the company look like? Will most of the younger crowd leave for the ""quick hits"" elsewhere? How do we maintain and protect our more senior employees. How do we keep them here before they take another job that offers them additional security? Listening to Ken Lay at the employee meeting when asked a question about pension I don't believe he really knew what type of retirement program we have in place. It really is, save all you can in your 401K and then we'll give you this cash balance vehicle to subsidize it. I know the cash balance option is a newer vehicle that many companies are moving to but Enron's is rather weak. Many companies apply a larger percentage than Enron's 5%. Obviously this all has a cost, I know these plans were carefully considered over the years and changing anything at this point is not going to happen. In addtition this probably goes against our culture in many respects and I'm not saying lets make this a job for life. We still need to manage our workforce as we have in the past and deal with employees that do not contribute regardless of age. 

Just wanted to share some honest thoughts and observations. I get concerned when I look at the makeup of our workforce and think about commitment, loyalty and ongoing leadership. I promise this isn't about me although I certainly have my concerns as I know you do also.  

Thanks for listening - Bob

Industrial Markets (led by Bruce Garner in Europe and Jeff McMahon worldwide) is expecting significant growth this year.  

Jeff and Bruce expect that by year end, they will have approximately 45 commercial people in Europe and will need significant support for their efforts.

This is a very exciting new business area for us in Europe and we need to ensure that they have sufficient resource dedicated to help them in their efforts.  Could each of you sit down with Bruce and agree the resource which will be dedicated to his group.  As a base proposition, all resources should be sourced out of Europe and each group must have at least one person who is accountable to Bruce for support.  Costs will be re-charged in the normal way.

Please let Jeff and I know what is agreed and call me if there are any difficulties.

Thanks.

Michael

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.

Bob, 

We all realize these are difficult times and we must all adjust and work together but I would like to make you aware of the recent support changes that pose some issues for Logistics.  We are told that the Solution Center is not available after 7:00 p.m.  Monday through Friday nor are they available on the weekend.  We are continuing to schedule gas in Logistics albeit on a limited basis during these after hours so is there anyway IT can manage to provide some level of support?

We appreciate your efforts to work with us to develop a solution.

Mike:  Do you have time to get together on Thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand?  Assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the ENW revised budget for 2002.  --Sally

Rick:  Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are ""baked enough"" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in light of revised plans for the various business units?  My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.  Which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the ENW budget.  
 
Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the ENW budget, if necessary.  Thanks.  --Sally

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally

I think that I mentioned her to you.  She is a VP who joined my team in January after spending four years in Enron's London office.  She graduated from Trinity and worked in public accounting before coming to Enron.  She would be great to have on a team.  I would love for her to join us at UT, but if she has another preference that is great, too.

Hi Leslie,
 
As per our conversation, I have attached the graphs and trend data for the ""top ten"" counterparties. These graphs and data represent the EOL deal counts for each counterparty, by business day, since 9/24 and are based on Activity Reports run from the EOL database.
 
The trends are great, as all of the major financial counterparties are either doing business as usual, or actually increasing their activity with us slightly.
 
I will be in the office by 7AM tomorrow, so please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,

"RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA","Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  

Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight.

Subject:	RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

Pretty huge cuts,   I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from other areas).  This is probably all the detail I'll require.  Let me have your final numbers when you can.  Obviously if there are any senior position changes I think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who they like or not.

We do want to run the business as is, I think the big difference is new IT projects, we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale.  On Operations I think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is no longer required - we need to just get back to where we were.  

Thanks

Subject:	Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

"Details on Meeting","Talked with Jenny - she will take care of beaming the simulcast onto the big screen for us tomorrow morning.  

I looked at the conference room, and it looks the way we left it yesterday - dirty.  Talked with the security guys and they called to check on cleaning crew. Should be here this afternoon at 2:00, so the room should be clean and neat by tomorrow morning.  

Have sent e-mail notice of meeting - included Tony Mends and Allan Sommer since I don't know Paskin's whereabouts and I do know that Mark Pickering won't be here.  Otherwise, Tony and Allan will be out of the loop.  Anyone else who will roll under Paskin that I should include?  

I will also leave voice mail messages on everyone's Enron extension and make calls to home numbers so that everyone will know about the 8:00 am meeting.  

Brent is here - will meet with McConnell at 3:00 on EGM (commercial) cost savings effort.  Not sure that McConnell will meet with Greg W.   Brent will update me after the 3:00 meeting.

"Elimination of Confirmations for EOL Transactions","Leslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on EnronOnline.  Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.  This elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  

Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction (ease of availability, type of 		record available, retention schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?)

	       Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of 			transactions, those that have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot)

	        Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth 		Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on 		ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting)

Sally,
It is on the list as a medium priority and we can discuss more on Monday.

I would not say that the system is totally done.  It is in User testing  -- Chris and crew are testing it and I will be getting a demo in the next week or two.  It has not been rolled out to the user community.  

I am also going to challenge them to think about whether there are any more quick ""cosmetic"" things that we could do with out much more time or cost.

Do you want to have a look before it rolls out?

Also  I thought maybe giving a preview to Louise would be good since she looks at the report pretty regularly, and is a big fan of automation.

Sally - We can probably use the pumpkin dip recipe; with so many ads we may need 2 pull-out pages (calendar/minutes being one).  Plus, it would be great for everyone to have it for the upcoming holidays.
Faxing or email will be the best way to get info to me today - it's back-to-back dentist appointments, manicures (my indulgence!), tumbling, cheerleading, etc. so I will out more than I'm in.
I really enjoy the newsletter and will be happy to remain in this position for next year (if you'd like me to!).  With my advertising/journalism background - although it's been a lot of years since I've used it very much - this is just my ""thing"".

Have a great day, and I'll look for the additional info - Thanks!  Robin

"Various Responses","On PRC:  In the next few days, I will be able to give Tina an idea on the time when we will start Senior Directors in the June 11th meeting and we will keep you posted that day on timing. 

Contracts:  I met this morning with Robert Jones and Ryan Seleznov on contracts for Brent and Bob.  They were going to get with Michelle Cash today with the goal of having contract drafts for me by the end of the day. (Legal has their offsite starting Wednesday, so we will be out of luck for legal help after today.)  I will keep you posted.  I believe that these new contracts will be well received. 

Q2 Goals:  Patti has the meeting on my calendar with you and Philippe for next Monday at 3:00.

I would like to come in at the senior director level.

Also, Robert told me you would get Brent and Bob done on contracts.

Also, I am setting up a meeting Monday with you, me and Philippe to just review your mid/back office goals for Q2.  Hopefully we can get a consensus on you spending most of your time with operations goals this quarter.  Assuming we can reach agreement, we can then go give Whalley the facts.

Thanks.

I will keep you posted on time and location for the meeting on the 11th.  If you join us for discussions on VP's, we will review Brent Price, Bob Hall, Peggy Hedstrom and Beth Apollo.  If you want to sit in on review of senior directors, that would pick up Leslie Reeves, James Scribner, Brenda Herod, Kevin Sweeney and Sheila Glover.  --Sally

I would love to hear more about the people who work for you.  However, I don't want to disrupt.  

Have it put on my calender and I can come to it when you are getting ready to do VPs.

Your thoughts?

Subject:	Operations PRC Meeting

Monday, June 11 has been set as the date for my operations PRC meeting.  At this meeting we will briefly review the results from numerous smaller PRC meetings that will have been held by my team during the week of June 4.  On June 11, we will give a cursory review to the results from the smaller PRC meetings from analysts through manager.  Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team) 

You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.  I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.  

My team is also included in a funtional PRC meeting that is held by Rick Causey.  In that meeting we review director level and above.  Rick has not set the date for that meeting.

"Re: Intern Acceptances and Declines","Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums throughout the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?  It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.

"RE: summer interns","Enron made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews several months ago.  At that time, I had surveyed my direct reports to determine the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomodate and I provided that number to the recruiting staff.  I understand from Ted Bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer interns to job opportunities and needs.  You might check with Lexi Elliot (one of the campus recruiters) to see if the number of incoming interns has matched the business needs.  If we have more jobs than interns, then Lexi could help in the process of interviewing Debbie for a position.  My last conversation with Ted Bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incoming interns, but it wouldn't hurt to check with Lexi.  --Sally

Hi Sally,
I just wanted to touch base and see if you know of anyone who has an opening in their dept for a summer student.  Debbie Wang is a third year marketing major and is interested in working at Enron.  She is the daughter of an I/T developer which I mentioned to you previously (Richard Wang).  I would appreciate any thoughts...

Thanks,

Subject:	Weekly Focus on Commercialization of Services

Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment.  Thanks!

"Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan","


A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Subject:	2001 Andersen Audits

Attached below are the 2001 Andersen business audits and the timeline for these audits and other work. Within this document, we have identified the EES owner(s) that will be involved in each business audit. The scope/objectives of each business audit have also been outlined.

Business Audit Approach
For each business audit, we plan to hold an opening and closing meeting with all key personnel involved for that project (includes business owners, CAO, EAS representative, and Andersen). The objectives of the opening meeting are to discuss specific audit areas, team members, key contacts, and to identify required EES documentation. The closing meeting will be critical as this is the final opportunity to ensure all facts surrounding any issues are agreed upon and initially discuss any action plans. Timing of the opening/closing meetings will be communicated by Andersen at a later date.

Please review the attached Andersen document to ensure the business owners have been properly identified. Please contact me with any revisions or other questions.

Thanks,
Misty

Mary,
Are you around - your voicemail message has said you were out for the day, for weeks.
We have a need for a CRM system, but not a very complicated one, and I thought that the one that Tony Mends demonstrated a couple of years ago might fit the bill. He tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities!

Thanks,
Richard

"Tuesday meeting and lunch follow-up","Tuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.  Given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.  MD's had a meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting.  

I have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can be present at the Hyatt meeting.  Since Mark and Greg are both travelling, I think that it is important to both Ken Lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting.  As a follow up, I am pulling together a group of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the conference room without door handles!). We will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale.  I will stress the importance of visible, consistant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.  I discussed this with Greg Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.

Who do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?  I need to send a note ASAP today to get this on everyone's calendar.  Beth Perlman suggested that we included Senior Directors and above.  Are you two okay with this?  --Sally

"RE: FBI Investigation","FBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new Enron garage Wednesday through Friday this week (#450).  The spot is clearly marked reserved, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.   I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, asking that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserved parking spaces in the garage.  

I have put up with this for 3 days.  If the FBI will be back here next week, however, I will grow tired of this.  Is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces?  

I know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved parking space that I never get to use!  

Thanks.  --Sally

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

"Meeting next week","I will be in the office on Tuesday next week (November 21), but hope to take the day off on Wednesday.  The kids will be out of school on Wednesday and we are going to Austin to be with my family for Thanksgiving.  So we hope to be on the road on Wednesday morning to beat some of the traffic.  

With that, sounds as if it would be better for us to get together on Monday, November 26.  

If you want to try and talk before then, a good time to get me is in car during my morning commute.  Number is 713-417-1591, and some range between 7:00 am and 8:30 am might work.  

These are certainly trying times.  You have been in my thoughts, and you have my commitment that it is certainly not out of sight, out of mind.

You will all be getting an invitation to a project greentlight meeting.  I would like to get together and discuss the logistics of what the committee will do.  Please think about:

1.  How often we should meet
2.  How to hold people accountable for projects
3.  Setting up timelines for where the committee thinks we should be at benchmark times.  (maybe each quarter end)
4.  Reporting progress to Sally and Rick Buy

I am sure there are many other things which I have left out, which you guys may want to add.  I appreciate everyone' s attention to this project both now and going forward.

Thanks,

Jeff

"RE: Presentation Rescheduling","These are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither date works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - Meagan has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in Austin that evening.  And on the 15th, I have a monthly National Charity League meeting.  As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.  If it turns out that the intent was a Tuesday night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best because we will be in Austin for interviews!  --Sally

We have the option of rescheduling the NetImpact presentation for either October 8 or October 15.  Is either date acceptable for your schedule?

The Estate version of the systems were commissioned successfuly onto Estate hardware this weekend with the users completing their testing on sunday, and it looks as though we are in good shape for doing the same for NetCo this week.
 
Just a few weeks ago there was a lot of doubts that it could be done, but thanks to a great display of team work, and just plain hard work, with many late nights (and a few sleep overs....), we met our first major milestone!!!!!
 
Thanks for the outstanding efforts over the last two weeks, that made this weekend possible.

"What is Clean Up Plan???","James responded and filled me in on the issue.  Sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems.  How are we going to clean up the existing backlog?  Did you know that this had grown so large?  James says that this sits in Shelly Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help. Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by Shelly.  

Bill is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things.  I hate getting these e-mails from him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me!  I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first.  (Don't worry - you are not alone in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).  Let's talk about how we can manage this better.

Subject:	Community Board Position

Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. 

We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide ""coaching"" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.

Subject:	A QUICK NOTE

Sally

Hope all is going well in your new role as COO (and they are not working you too hard !)

As you know the European Office is currently undergoing a restructuring with voluntary redundancies etc.

I am currently working in EBS Europe as controller for Mid/Back Office - I have responsibilities for the following functions:-
- Contract Mgt / Documentation
- Risk Mgt
- Settlements
- Trade Accounting & Financial Reporting

This covers basically the whole of the Mid/Back office function.
Now EBS in Europe is not looking in good shape at the moment (with only 3 trades completed last month, and the whole of the Telecoms industry in a bit of a recession - with no indicators asto when this will change), so I think now is the time to start looking at other opportunities that may be available in other Enron business units.

As you may already know I have 9 years experience in Enron (7 yrs PQE since qualifying as a Accountant) gained in Finance, Structuring, new business set-ups (Gas, Continental Power, J-Block, EBS).

I have already spoken to Fernley Dyson & Barry Pearce as to what roles may be available in Enron (they are both getting back to me) and was wondering if you had knowledge of any other roles, given my particular skill-set both here in Europe and the US.

If you can't think of anything it doesn't matter - just though I would drop you a note on the off-chance.
But if you can think of any areas or have the names of people I could contact I would be most grateful

Thanks

Neil

Two of the three are Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - details below in my e-mail to Louise.  

Another excellent player is Shona Wilson.  She currently leads the group that produces the DPR and the MPR.  She had excellent experience with PWC before joining Enron, auditing trading companies in Europe.  I have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business.  She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity.

Subject:	Weather and Crude

The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.

Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kevin would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  

Let's discuss.  --Sally

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.

Please find attached the most recent update for Merchanting Metals.

In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are behind schedule. Additional resources are being allocated and the situation is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going operations ).

Please contact me if you require any additional information

Subject:	Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject:	Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility (""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source documentation within Enron
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Jenny --

There are 25 owned and 6 leased fax machines on ECS 05 & 06 per the UBS asset scheduled.  After doing a walk though on the floors, the machines are concentrated in certain business areas.  Current machine placement will not accommodate the type of usage that I suspect Sally's group will need to have.

My suggestion is that the settlements group(s) bring their fax machines with them, and we have the numbers changed.

Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Subject:	Oklahoma follow up

Below is a quick follow up to some of the things I mentioned I'd check out at our last meeting.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance with your efforts.

Contributions
The contributions from last year that I mentioned at the meeting turned out to be inclusive of Enron Corp., individual and matching funds.

Weather
I had a chance to talk with our folks from the Weather Group.  The information regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended up being a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams not our weather group.

Scholarship
There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives underway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the individual universities employed here.  They take advantage of matching funds and are administered by employees here with some assistance by Community Relations and University Affairs.  If you are interested in organizing an effort like this for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the details.

Subject:	Forecast for 2001

Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it.

FYI below.

You mentioned today in the PRC meeting some numbers on VPs across Enron Corp.  I was surprised at the total number of VPs in the company that were not commercial.

ENW has 14 VPs, 1 MD and 3 in the OTC for a total of 18 employees in ENW at or above VP across commercial, commercial support, specialized technical and technical.

Of the 14 VPs, 5 are specialized technical, 2 are commercial and 7 are commercial support.

Although I have a large number of employees to look at in the coming months for both budget and PRC, I do not have very many at senior levels.

We will have an ENW PRC report as per your request from the meeting today by next Wednesday.

I will be coordinating the efforts around the subject priority identified at the Global Accounting Leadership Conference.  We will be identifying people to help on all five priorities depending on each group's needs and interests.

The elements of the ""attract and retain keyemployees"" priority include:  

	1.  resource planning and utilization across Global Accounting 
	2.  on-campus and experienced hire recruiting
	3.  career development (effective analyst program for Global Accounting; new hire orientation; career planning, etc)
	4.  performance management (applying the PRC process in Global Accounting; additional forms of rewards and 
	     recognition)
	5.  networking/social activities

1.  Which of these elements, if any, are of particular concern to your group?
2.  Is there a  particular person(s) you would like to assign to one, several or all of these elements?

I anticipate that the time requirements will not be significant (a few hours each week, depending on the number of elements addressed by an individual, with some weeks heavier and some weeks lighter).

Please let me know!  Thanks!

"Community Board Position","Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. 

We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide ""coaching"" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.

Sally,

In the event that a manual payment needs to be sent, I need your approval to set up Jenny Latham, my lead in London, and Rebecca Millerchip, settlements lead for EGM for them to sign off.  As we are moving to replicate the EGM payment process in London for EIM, utilizing EGM resources, this should only be a temporary need because EIM's payment templates are not fully set up in SAP yet.

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks,

Kevin

We were going to Mike/Fernley for this since that was per policy.  If we're going to ask for exceptions then it makes sense for me to be set up for manual payments over $1 mil.

Rick - Sorry to bother you with this but Treasury is requiring your approval.  London Operations currently has only one person (Cindy Horn) authorized to approve manual payments.  Obviously this can be a problem if Cindy is out of the office.  I would like to gain authorizaiton for Becky Millerchip in London, who manages the Coordination and Settlements groups and reports to Cindy, to approve manual payments.  Can you help us with this?

It is my understanding that any delegation of manual payment approval that falls outside the levels set by Rick Causey need to be approved by Rick.  I realise that we do have limited numbers of staff in London with the required approval level but we need to be sure that we can accept deviations from the policy.

following Rick Causey's e-mail re controls over manual payments, I have been asked to get you to approve a list of Accounting Directors in our area who will be required to sign off on all manual payments of more than USD1mil in value.

Cindy Horn is the only Director in our group so naturally she should be the primary signatory.

Since manual payments are only done in extreme circumstances, they are usually very last minute and need to be signed off immediately in order to not miss Treasury deadlines and incur unnecessary late payment charges.  I really feel that it would be in the interest of the company to have more than one authorised signatory for manual payments.

Although I am Manager and not Director, how would you feel about me being a back up for Cindy if she is not around?

Thanks

Subject:	Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a ""Workflow"" system to route invoice images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be processed.

"Revised Hdct. Spreadsheet","Have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight.  

THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED: 


Had Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers.  Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for Beth's EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers.  You will want to gut check this with Beth. 

Had Jenny's current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's.  Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions.  Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's.  You will need to get that detail from Jenny to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount.  

There was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development.  Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown).  His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32.  But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group.  Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work.  Please go over details with Tom and make corrections as needed.  

Didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC.  Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179.   Allan only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info.  So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced.  Please review with Allan and make corrections as needed.  

 
Have a nice Thanksgiving with your families.  You can reach my by cell phone tommorrow (mine: 713-417-1591 or David's:  713-299-1436) or at my parents' home starting about mid-afternoon (512-458-5510).

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"Contributions to CommodityLogic","In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
	CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
	CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
	CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior Director
	CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

	User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and 		Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

	NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
	ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic.

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

"Management Team Changes","Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.  

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team.

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

David

As you can see from the below ""stacked"" e-mails we continue to have significant issues in our attempt to bill the Rexam account.  Service Management has had weekly meetings with  Billing on this account and yet this problem still persists.  While I am confident that Ben and Evan are aware of this issue we do not seem to have either the ability or the proper resources to bring it to a sucessful resolution.  

In addition to these issues on Rexam we have had a failure to follow through on a bill payment issue on a Tyco account that has caused us to not pay the utility bill for two months at the headquarters site.  This has been raised to our counterpart's attention at Tyco and though we have taken steps to resolve this event it has provided another data point in Tyco's mind as to our competency.  This is obviously happening at a important time in our negotiations.

Evan has acknowledged his accountability for building the procedures and processes that will allow us to successfully live up to our obligations in our contracts.

Craig,

This absolutely shocks me.  We really focused upon making the process
simple during the renegotiations and at last month's meeting we were
lead to believe that you had your hands around this.  For Jack to take this
much time and have so many errors is a totally non-value activity.

It certainly looks like the team from Enron needs more resources.  I'd
expect you to be prepared to explain at the monthly meeting in
Winston-Salem on the 8th what issues remain and specific action items
to resolve this problem in 2001.  We can not accept this as a go forward
process in 2002.  Is this too much to ask?




**********Below is the first e-mail.*************


Becky,

In retrospect, I wanted to comment on a few items from our meeting this
past Monday at your offices. I feel it is necessary to document what I still
perceive to be very poor performance on the invoice and account
management received from Enron. 

While I had low expectations for this particular invoice - especially due to
many of the new rules coming into play for the Second Amendment - we
still spent almost 5 hours reviewing, changing and correcting this
document. When you take into account that 2 of the 3 California plants
did not have electric invoices for us to review - and this is not Enron's
fault but PG&E's - the fact that this review took so long is not a good
sign. Ten of the twenty-one individual plant statements had some type of
error - and half of those were serious errors.

I am looking to see vast improvements in the future. I do not see us
stopping this monthly review process in the near future, and days like
Monday reinforce that thinking.

On another note, we spent close to an hour on the Natural Gas slip-up
with our Olive Branch Plant - which was inexcusable. I credit Enron for
doing the firefighting drill to reestablish nominations in time for the
November cutoff; however, the situation should have never been
allowed to spin out of control in the first place. I had to intercede with the
Energy Management representative to keep the nomination open beyond
noon to accommodate this oversight. I am looking to have Barry or Evan
provide me with an action plant to prevent his in the future.

Unfortunately, this allowed us little time to review open issues. I will
recap those we did review on future e-mails. Sometime today or
tomorrow, I will coordinate a time that we can then ""resume our meeting""
via phone.

Regards,
Jack Bender

Subject:	Confidential Folder to safely pass information to  Arthur Andersen


We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information (dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the ""o"" drive under Corporate called Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

It appears that EOL is being given out to people who have not received authorization to trade.  The latest is someone reporting up through Jean Mrha. (John Grass)  Why doesn't RAC require that anyone requesting authorization to get EOL get approved through RAC.  I'm sure Lavo doesn't know (or maybe he does) that we have yet another unauthorized trader to rein in.

Any suggestions?

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?

2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's e-mail box that states ""I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response.""

3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to Vanessa Schulte's mail box.

   Paul,

   Thanks for lunch a few weeks ago.  Sounds like you have a ton of work
   and responsibility these days.

   Also, thanks for working with Gros on CommodityLogic.  It is a great
   application that I think will help our industry better manage the ever
   increasing transaction flow.

   In addition to CommodityLogic, and as a follow-up to our lunch, I would
   like to come over in a few weeks and sit down and show you and your team
   what we mean by ""outsourcing"" your mid and back office functions to our
   ""ProsessCo/ServiceCo.""  I think we have identified what types of
   services we could offer and under what type of arrangements.  Basically,
   you have risk reporting, general ledger, deal capture, confirmation,
   nominations/scheduling, volume management and settlements (invoice and
   cash payments/collections).  We will articulate how it works and how it
   hopefully makes sense for you to let us add a few more resources to
   accomodate your growing business instead of you building it from
   scratch.

   I also talked to Whalley and Bibi about your concerns on
   security/neutrality, comparable service levels to Enron, term and the
   ability to do financial easier than physical.  We can go through all
   that as well.

   I will contact you soon and arrange a time.

   Let me know your thoughts.

   Piper

Wes and Wade,

Rick Buy and the RAC/EES team have compiled a list of EES projects, the so-called ""Points of Light"" list. Its objectives are the following:

	- articulate the progress of EES initiatives to the BOD
	- ensure that important activities are not overlooked
	- assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals
	- monitor completion of projects against a set timetable

I suggest that we revise this list to reflect reality better. Also, you could use this list as a management tool to ensure that in six months EES issues are properly addressed.

I could meet with you and walk you through the ""Points of Light"" list.

In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

Beth,

I have voice mailed John Brindle, Sr. Director, Corp-Public Affairs, who according to Bill Donovan is currently responsible for International Security and the correct Enron Contact on this matter.  

In summary, the CP in question (Mustafa M Ahmad - only a name match we are not certain of an exact match) was set up in GCP as an EES Gas customer as part of the legacy cleanup during August.  A CP with this name is listed in the HP9EESOCA billing system as active.  The record has been suspended in GCP by London and based on our records and research there is no active A/R or MTM exposure.

Expect that upon further instructions from John Brindle, and confirmation of an exact match, we will proceed with Settlements and potentially CSC as appropriate.

Awaiting further instructions from John Brindle.

In response to the recent order from President Bush to freeze any assets held in the name of a published list of groups and individuals suspected of terrorist activity, we conducted a search of the GCP database to ensure we did not have any established relationship with anyone on the list.

We found no such relationships with Enron Europe.  However, we thought we had better inform you that we did discover one record, created for Houston EES, with the following name which did appear on the list:

Mustafa M Ahmad GCP ID 130061.

The ID has been suspended by my GCP team here.  Please let me know if you need any further information.  

Kind regards

Anna

My goal here - for Jim - is to understand how many bodies (& related cost) it is going to take to support the Wholesale Post Bankruptcy actvities - as we are doing for all support and commercial functions - so we can complie a fwd cash forecast.

Any education would be appreciated. An org chart would also help.

Subject:	Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were ""show stoppers"" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the ""fixes"" and migrated the code last night.  Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the ""new"" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

 Obituary

The Pillsbury Dough boy died yesterday of a yeast infection and
complications
from repeated pokes in the belly.  He was only 71. Dough boy was buried in a
lightly greased coffin.  Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their
respects, including Mrs.Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins,
Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies and Captain Crunch.

The grave site was piled high with flours, as longtime friend Aunt Jemima
delivered the eulogy, describing Dough boy as a man who never knew how much
he was kneaded.  Dough boy rose quickly in show business but his later life
was filled with turnovers.  He was not considered a very smart cookie,
wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes.  Despite being a little
flaky at times, he even still, as a crusty old man, was considered a roll
model for millions.  Toward the end it was thought that he would rise again,
but alas, he was no tart.

Dough boy is survived by his wife, Play Dough, two children, John Dough and
Jane Dough, plus they had one in the oven.  He is also survived by his
elderly father, Pop Tart.
 The funeral was held at 3:50 for about twenty minutes.

"Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations","I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more than anything else.  --Sally

Subject:	Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):  

		29th Floor (trading)	67 employees		EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk 

		30th Floor (trading)	35 employees		EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products) 

		31st Floor (trading)	52  employees		Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR 										and MPR teams
		
		32nd Floor (trading)	117 employees		Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis

				 
		37th Floor			148 employees		Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services 	

My suggestion would be to add to more floor meetings to your schedule - one on the operations end of the 32nd floor and one on the 37th floor.  
					
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Hello Kenneth,

I am writing this short note in an effort to further my understanding of
Enron and establish some rapport with you regarding your ideas on voice and
video conferencing.
Polycom Network Systems manufactures the Accord infrastructure that allows
you to have multiple participants in video and voice conferences
simultaneously.  Fundamentally, I am interested to hear your ideas on voice
and video conferencing and perhaps have a discussion on how your
requirements (if they exist at all) may be addressed by Polycom Network
Systems in a dually beneficial business relationship.

I have attached two short introductions to the Accord Product Line to
eliminate the anonymity of this correspondence.  The Multi Network
Communication attachment furthers your knowledge about video conferencing.
The V2GC-20 attachment discusses the many features that the Accord Product
Line has to offer.

All the best to you,

"RE: Team building event for my direct reports","Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much communication from ""above"" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.  

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside Enron.  --Sally

Subject:	Team building event for my direct reports



I have been sort of waiting to talk to you about having a small event for my direct reports to thank them for their efforts until things cooled down at the company overall, but -- I don't see that happening any time soon.

We have not really done anything at all this year, and I wanted to do an event similar to the one you had last summer for us.  They have worked so hard and we can't ever all get away from the office at the same time  -- even to have a lunch.

Was thinking about having them over to my house for drinks and then out to eat at a restraunt.  For my direct reports and spouses.  Will include both Global Services and EES.  Was thinking of Friday night after work Dec 7th.  Need to get planning if I get the go ahead.

I have a reasonably priced italian restraunt in mind, and it would be about 20 people.   Are you ok with that? And if so, would you and David want to come too?

Let me know your thoughts

Beth

"RE: Assistants Meeting","Good question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an Enron conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by Mark, Greg or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants.  

It is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.  

Please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --Sally 

Just thought of this:  We should have all approvers within the ""ibuyit"" and ""ibuyit-payables"" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments.  Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.  We should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures.

We have a meeting with ENW Assistants on Monday at lunch.  Agenda topics include timesheets (what the different off-duty codes mean, why they should make sure that employees in their depts. do timesheets, etc.) and back-up procedures during absences.  Marla Barnard will be there as well to answer any HR-related questions the assistants may have.

Is there any timely information we can share with regard to spending?

As I am sure you are all aware recruitment of key quality people is paramount to the success of Risk Management. You should also be aware that many of us spend an awful lot of time on recruitment from talking to agencies to interviewing.

We currently have a number of vacancies and have been finding the CVs we have been receiving from recruitment agencies have not produced the pool of talent we need. As a result we have today placed an advertisement in the FT a copy of which is attached below. Of course none of you will of seen the advert because you don't look at the recruitment pages but just in case this is what is happening and why.

If there are any queries please give me a call or better still nominate someone and see if you can get any entry for the Z3.

Sally - sorry I didn't get back to you tonight; it was late when we got home from post-volleyball dinner and then the kids were on the phone - and internet until now.  It's been a long day to start the week!

We have a lot of ads this month (9)!  They will be ""scattered"" throughout the newsletter rather than all being placed on the back page, as they won't all fit in the half page.  If you'd like to mail the checks to Barb Lindsey (5523 Grosvenor Square, Houston 77069), that would be fine.  I don't keep the pink sheets once the newsletter is mailed out.

Nancy sent me a message that there will not be an official food drive at the Holiday Tea, and no announcement in the newsletter.  She indicates that we'll focus on the book drive for The Bridges, and Adopt-A-Family, and that, with the Sr. Presentation fees and tea fees all due in one month, it would be too much to do a food drive, too.  However, she said that if food items arrive we'll deliver them to NAM or TEAM.  If that's not still correct, please let me know.

Thanks!  Robin

Subject:	Rotation Question



Hi Sally - 

I submitted the question at the Networks meeting in regards to employee rotation, and I though I'd drop you a note to expand on my thoughts. Being at Enron for just shy of a year, I quickly learned how frequently people informally move within the company and their business units. I've also noticed that often this is a point of frustration for many managers, and can cause friction and negative energy between business units. Logically, these transfers are typically occur into the ""hot"" BU's and into the ""cold"" BU's. 

I think a ""formal"" job rotation program within the support structure could help to minimize some of the above issues, and more importantly could provide a platform for developing, challenging, and retaining our staff. The rotation programs I've seen at my previous employers typically stop at the manager level, and require an employee to stay in a role for one year. After one year, they may submit their preference to remain in their current job which may or may not be accepted by the rotation committee. 

I am aware of the success of the rotation process within the analyst program and I would think there may be an opportunity to parlay this to the support platform. I appreciate your feedback on the topic. Thanks and regards.

Just had a total of three market risk people quit or transfer and each one said one of the considerations was they spent so much time on operational issues that they weren't developing as they should analyzing portfolio risk. I think it might be best if we have a meeting or two and see what issues are identified. It may be better to split in two meetings as you suggested. I need to hear what the nature of the problems are. Some I know like ees, metals, uk power but I think there may be some other fundamental issues that are hindering progress here.

"Updates","Everyone worked hard and did a good job on Friday night and Saturday.  From IT, Jenny Rub, Steve Stock, Iain Greig, Anthony Dayao and Ramesh Rao were very engaged and did some great work.  Jeff Johnson was kept updated while in route back to Houston and he is in the office today reviewing the work that has been done to date.  Other ENW team members hard at work with us over the weekend have been Bob Hall, Beth Apollo, Kevin Sweeney, Kerry Roper and Marla Barnard.  

Greg P. and I met with Kerry Roper this am to review the summarized version of the work that has been done.  Looks good - and it is unlikely that we will get with Greg Whalley to review the data this weekend.  He's meeting with commercial teams currently, and then will be on a plane for NYC later today.  We will take tomorrow to incorporate any changes that Jeff Johnson may have, and to get the entire weekend team to review and affirm (or change) the data as it is now summarized.   

I will e-mail Greg W. an update on the work that we have done today and will copy you on that message.  Greg P. and I decided not to e-mail the details to him - better to review in person.  He will know that we are ready.  

Quick preview of Monday's intended schedule:

8:00 am		All direct reports of OOC of ENW will meet in Conference Room 4175 in ECS to view together the web-cast of Dynegy conference call

9:00		Following webcast, Greg P., Marla Barnard and I will meet with OOC direct reports to review Q&A and to talk about next steps

9:30		I will meet briefly with weekend team to go over work needed on Monday re: cost saving measures

10:00		The start of a whirlwind series of floor meetings to reach all ENW employees (have the details mapped out - attached is copy of 			spreadsheet)

4:00		Regroup with weekend team to review data revised during the day on cost saving measures

5:00		Greg P. is buying...

Outstanding item on cost savings efforts:  We didn't include or touch the ISC.  Their budget for 2002 is included in Corp., but since responsibility now rests with you, we need to get Allan involved in the same exercise that we worked over the weekend.  Would you like for me to meet with him on Monday to get him started?  Then you can take it from there?  Or would you like to wait and address this with Allan when you are back in the office?  Just let me know. 

Have a good flight back.  Let me know if there is anything that I can do for you tomorrow while you are in route back to Houston.  --Sally

   I put some review customers in the system.  Don't feel all that great about them, (from a commercial feedback standpoint)  Wondered if you feel these are appropriate.  We may not hear from some of these people -- but it is worth a shot.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.

"Preliminary Cost Savings for EA","From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

 I have talked with Delainey about providing infrastructure for NewCo, and had independently come to the conclusion that we must manage mid and back office for all estate activities (liquidating activities and building activities) in one group to provide the best coverage and flexibility for resources.   With the still anticipated spin-off of Netco, I have created a plan to reorganize the operations teams' efforts.  I will be glad to share that with you as we work jointly on the infrastructure to service all estate needs.  --Sally

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Subject: Headcount for Operations - Need Questions Answered


John:
 
I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.
 
We  need some questions answered first to go through this:
 
1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.
 
2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  
 
3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?
 
4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?
 
5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?
 
We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.

We are closing on our house 11/26 (this all happened very quickly - a house in our neighborhood went on the market and we looked at it and bought it, listed ours & have a contract on it, too - in all of 3 weeks!) so things are nuts around here!!  I will be very disciplined and try to have the December newsletter ready so it can go to Sally Walker before Thanksgiving.  We didn't plan this closing date very well, did we?!

Subject:	Storing of data on EnronOnline

I spoke with Sally regarding the cessation of sending confirms for EnronOnline transactions, and she mentioned that the question was raised as to how long we store transaction details on EnronOnline.

We store all transactions on the database since inception, in order to facilitate customer transaction searches. This data is the basic buy/sell, commodity, location, volume, price, customer, userid, and time info. In addition for a rolling 45 day period we store the web server info which is much more detailed and has product ID's, session ID's and so forth. At the end of 45 days it is archived and retrievable. when you put these two together you have a very complete picture of what happened to a transaction attempt.

I hope this answers any questions you may have. If not let me know.

Please go through my e-mails and print everything from Melissa Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either Rick and/or Melissa.  They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from Melissa relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then please delete all e-mails from Melissa.  

Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for Houston's Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from Marilyn Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these e-mails.  

E-mails from Lexi Elliott regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks.

Subject:	Telephone Outage Enron Houston

Sally, Bob - FYI 

I was able to get 5 telephone numbers set up on a temporary switch so if our counterparties call into the Enron building during the outage (Friday 10:00 PM until Saturday 6 AM) they will get the voicemail of the 5 key schedulers that we selected. The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page & home #'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information for every pipe we do business on.  The schedulers were also instructed to call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and cell #'s.

If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a pipeline of market emergency could occur. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.

"RE: NETCO","Barry would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with Wes and see what we can suggest. 

With regard to your comment that I am ""in"", in my conversation with Greg Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  

Leslie Reeves will be getting the org charts to Tammie this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Ladies,

Attached is a spreadsheet showing the cost for each of the Tiffany items you want to see.  Included are the 15% discount, 100 minimum quantity, tax.  It's also assuming that I can negotiate free shipping.  I think we need to stay under $10,000.  Even if we end up splitting it 3 ways, I would be afraid to go much higher.  Given that, I'll ask Leslie with Tiffany to bring everything under $100.

I have asked Anthony to update me today on how we can get this completed ASAP.  This will solve the problem on a go-forward basis.

Subject:	EES Settlements - Follow Up

As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --Sally   (x35926)

Our primary goal will be to make sure that the appropriate distribution has been met, and that we are aware of the individuals that are 1's and 5's.    The main focus of the meeting will be to cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across the operations organization and the teams that support EA, EGM and EIM.  (We are still debating if and how we cross calibrate with the London operations team) 

You mentioned today that you might like to attend this meeting.  I wanted you to have the date so that you could put this on your calendar.

Two for Unify (one for logistics and one for EDI)
One for Gas Risk

I won't make requests for specific personnel (yet)  just not the most junior

Subject:	FW: Impact and Influence

The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  

Enron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  

However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as directors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution.  
Thanks.

"Weather and Crude","The list of proposed Netco employees that Amy Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  Bob Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  

We retained two top-notch operations individuals - Todd Hall and Kevin Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  Todd and Kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.

Todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, Todd created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   

Sweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his Enron experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  

If you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, Todd and Kevin would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  

Let's discuss.  --Sally

Also, two of your employees are interested in participating at the conference Mark McClure and Errol McLauglin.  You have a total of four conferences passes to utilize for your group.  Please let me know if you would like them to attend for career development purposes.  They are both willing to recruit at the conference.  NABA is expecting over 2,000 professional participants this year.  Thank you for your support for the organization.  This will be a wonderful new partnership for Enron and your organization.

Thanks for the list of questions.  I am always glad when someone takes me up on that type of offer, because I genuinely want the input from others.

Sally-

Yesterday at the floor meeting on the 32nd floor, I asked you a pointed question regarding trust of company management.  I appreciated your effort to confront the frustration that many employees currently have.

However, you also requested other questions.  I have a number of questions, and I have tried to collect a number of questions from those that I have heard around the floor.  In addition, I have a couple of suggestions for what could be done to build badly lacking morale.

I am sorry for the long list, but in reality this is probably just the tip of the iceberg regarding questions and concerns out there.  I hope that you can answer some of these questions, and I hope that you can ask some of these questions to those who might know.

I appreciate your efforts.

Here is the list:

I have sent this to my two supervisors as well.

Have a nice day.

It will be important for all of us as members of the senior leadership team of ENW to be familiar with tomorrow's discussion at the all-employee meeting.  

To provide a follow-up opportunity to discuss what we hear in tomorrow's all-employee meeting, I invite you to attend an informal lunch meeting with me in ECS 4990 beginning at 12:00 noon.  This will give us the chance to clarify what we have heard and to collectively anticipate the reactions and additional questions that employees may have.  It will be important particularly now to be visible and accessible to our teams.  --Sally

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Subject:	Re: Costs   

I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two ""test runs"" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we will try to make up for time lost yesterday.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas			Frank Vickers (East)
			Laura Luce (Central)
			Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives		Fred LaGrasta

Power		Dave Duran
			Ozzie Pagan
			Ed Baughman
			Bruce Shuckley 

Portland		Chris Calger

Calgary		Ladain

Mexico		Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally

"Headcount for Operations - Need Questions Answered","John:
 
I got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with Jeff, Stacey and Leslie to find out.
 
We  need some questions answered first to go through this:
 
1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.
 
2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  
 
3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?
 
4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with Leslie Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?
 
5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will Stacey and Jeff simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?
 
We may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.

"RE: ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC","Thanks for forwarding the note to me.  I have asked Shona and Brent to get back with me on answers to your questions.  Shona's team did move this weekend to ECS (as did I), and I am not sure how much additional chaos this has added to her life for today!  I will follow up with her mid -afternoon on details.  

I agree with you that this serves as a good case study  - underscores indeed that we need to start some of the projects under Project Greenlight instead of continuing to document problems.  By definition,  to arrive at complete and accurate transfer daily of information from all source systems to RisktRAC, we must know the universe of all books and spreadsheets.  --Sally

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

John is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunately occur rather frequently.  When he cited the reason for performance issues in his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being handled during normal business hours.  Here is his response.  I bring this to your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.  I know that everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we have to stay closely coordinated.  I know that EOL has a dedicated member of your team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issues that could or do touch EOL.  Is there anyone assigned from your team for a similar role with our critical operating systems?  Because of nomination deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify, it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's performance is impaired.  Let me know if you can assign someone from the infrastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Unify.  Thanks.  --Sally

Unfortunately, we didn't get a notification - we played detective.
 
In their defense, they had tried to do the resynchronization after-hours a couple of times and it failed, so they were somewhat desperate to get this done.  Nonetheless, a phone call should have been made to our team in advance.

Thanks for the updates.

Subject: Unify Operational Status
Here is a summary of Unify operations for today.  My plan was to provide these reports to this audience through the end of this week, and then pick up again during next bid week.  I'll be glad to continue this type of reporting moving forward, please let me know if you are interested.  Alternatively, I could move to a weekly reporting of issues, and/or change the audience of this report.  Your feedback on the matter is appreciated.
 
Summary of 9/28:
?         Heavy activity in the Gas system, especially in the afternoon.  System performance dropped during the afternoon, but no downtime was experienced. 
?         At just after 3:00 pm, a network server experienced problems and as a result one of our EDI servers was unable to accept new files.  No EDI files could be sent to our hub as a result.  As it turns out, the Infrastructure team was in the process of performing a critical re-synchronization on that server, and the server was unable to write new data to disk for over an hour (during re-synchronization this window is typically just a few minutes).  Infrastructure typically conducts resynchronizations after-hours, but resynchronization had failed on this box on several prior attempts, so the issue had become critical.  At 4:26 pm, the re-synchronization completed and all EDI files in the queue were processed normally, and our 5:00 pm intraday nom deadline was met.  
Action Items:
o        The network servers referenced are to be decommissioned on October 5th, and will be replaced with newer more reliable servers.  This is part of a planned project within the Infrastructure team. 
o        I have discussed the issue with the Infrastructure team and communicated our various intra-day processing deadlines.  They have committed to notifying the Unify team in the event future emergency-type maintenance is required during business hours. 
?         On the Power side, we have caught up on all of our processing that was delayed as a result of yesterday's outage.

Subject:	Confidential Folder to safely pass information to  Arthur Andersen


We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information (dpr/position info, curves, validations/stress tests, etc) being passed to Arthur Andersen for audit purposes over the Web to their Arthur Andersen email addresses. (necessary now they no longer have access to Enron's internal email system)  

Please use the folder described below when passing any info (that you would have concerns about if it was picked up by a third party) via the shared drive that has been set up for this specific purpose.   

Note:  AA should also use the shared drive to pass info back if there are questions, or the data needs updating.  We should also consider the sensitivity of audit findings and special presentations if they are being distributed electronically.


Please pass this note to others in your groups who have the need to pass info back and forth.

 
Details on how to access for those who will use this method to pass info:

A secured folder has been set up on the ""o"" drive under Corporate called Arthur_Andersen (O:\Corporate\Arthur_Anderson).  Please post all confidential files in this folder rather than emailing the files to their company email address.  If you need access to this folder, submit an eRequest through the IT Central site: http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/SecurityRequests/.  Arthur Andersen will be able to retrieve these files for review with their terminal server access at the Three Allen Center location.

Please contact Vanessa Schulte if you have any problems or questions

"FW: Impact and Influence","The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  

Enron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  

However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as directors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution.

Subject:	You asked for questions

Sally-

Yesterday at the floor meeting on the 32nd floor, I asked you a pointed question regarding trust of company management.  I appreciated your effort to confront the frustration that many employees currently have.

However, you also requested other questions.  I have a number of questions, and I have tried to collect a number of questions from those that I have heard around the floor.  In addition, I have a couple of suggestions for what could be done to build badly lacking morale.

I am sorry for the long list, but in reality this is probably just the tip of the iceberg regarding questions and concerns out there.  I hope that you can answer some of these questions, and I hope that you can ask some of these questions to those who might know.

I appreciate your efforts.

Here is the list:


 

I have sent this to my two supervisors as well.

Have a nice day.

"RE: budget questions","Major budget focus for today beginning in a few minutes is to have our act together for the Delainey/Dietrich EES review tomorrow - Anthony Dayao, Beth Apollo and Kerry Roper will join me for a walk through.  
 
Finalizing EIM budget will likely not get done today.  Can give you the details on why later today.  Will become obvious. 
 
Just meet with Shankman and McConnell.  Not ready to finalize EGM budget yet.  They say that their commercial guys are waiting for Jeff Johnson to get with them on details of IT development projects.  I think that Jeff has been out for a few days, but I did see him on the 3rd floor when I was down there with Shankman and McConnell.  I will leave him a voice mail message to get an update on outstanding issues from his point of view.  Jeff and Mike want to have their stuff finalized by Friday.  I will convey that timeline to Jeff Johnson. 
 
After EES budget prep meeting this afternoon, next tall order of business is expanding our receivables monetization beyond EA to other commodities.  High priorty and very short time fuse on this one, for reasons that should be obvious.  I will have all of the Operations leads and settlements leads together this afternoon, along with Ramesh Rao and others in IT who may be required to help us extract necessary info.  
 
Nice way of telling you, Greg, that I understand your desire for a page of footnotes with budget explanations for Whalley, and that in my opinion that falls at the end of the list behind some of these other things today.  I will work with Kerry on this.  I can tell you, however, that updates on budgets are not top on anyone's lists today, including Whalley's.  We will honor your commitment to get him updated information, and will provide as much detail as possible.  Best approach given the state of business today may be to provide him with the high level overview (that one page of expense and capital), state where we are in the review process with each business unit, and highlight reductions in expense and capital to date.   We can continue to provide updates to Whalley as the EES, EIM, EGM and EBS (yes, I need to coordinate with Mark P. when he is back on some changes here - confidential at this point).  Don't know how useful detailed footnotes will be for Whalley before we truly finalize the various business unit budgets.  --Sally

Subject: budget questions



Some things that jump out at me on the Whalley packet page labelled Global Support Dollars - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast Variance dated 10/23/01
 
Under EGM, increase of 5,573 in operations expense and increase of 16,159 in IT development expense.  Doesnt that sound like a big jump?
 
What made EIMs infrastructure go up 2,334?
 
How is energy operations for EES down 9,092?
 
What did EES spend capital on in 2001 to make the capital IT infrastructure variance be down 19,726?
 
What is going on at Corp. with a positive IT infrastructure variance of 13,924?
 
On the front page or Whalley summary page, why did depreciation go from 62,028 to 30,124 to 57,843.  I know some of what you said Kerry but we need to make sure that Enron knew the 2001 depreciation number in the 2001 plan and that 62,028 did get depreciated accurately and that it just so happened to turn out that only 30,124 got done on our books.
 
You get the point.  I think this is what Whalley will do too with the entire packet on all pages.  I know the numbers are right, they just beg alot of questions so make sure we have an updated, very accurate cheat sheet with all the explanations so when he gets the packet today, he can follow it!
 
I assume everything ties that should.
 
Thanks.

"RE: Regrouping of ENW Budget Discussions","Wes and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The schedule that we have been working with that Wes provided did not allocate two hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting that Ken Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs through the evening hours..  Only because Beth Perlman is out on Thursday for a religious holiday, I decided to ""skip out"" from this meeting to be here on Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets together.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orchestrated the time swap with Vince Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW meeting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for Ken Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, Louise. 

Scheduling issues aside, Wes suggested that we also review with you the EES budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets together, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us.  

We will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our ""scope of engagement"" discussion.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for discussion on that.    --Sally

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows: 

Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees 

Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop,
											Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA
											Operations, including Calgary)
	
Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering,
											Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)

Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise

Subject: Current ENW 


A quick summary on where ENW is relative to NetCo and the Estate.
 
Some quick numbers first (all numbers are exclusive of the pipelines and Steve Hotte's group).  
 
We will have about 117 employees remaining in the estate on the application side (Perlman) after about 100 go with NetCo.  We will have 121 employees remaining with the estate on the infrastructure side (Rub for now) after 60 go with NetCo.  We will have 9 on estate EOL IT (that will end up with the estate application group) after 40 go with NetCo.  We will have about 48 from EA operations (Hall) remaining with the estate after about 170 go with the NetCo.  We will have a few EOL operations people after about 40 go with NetCo.  We also have individuals remaining on the operations side for EGM and EIM under Kevin Sweeney.  We also have estate employees under Dayao with EES IT who have gas and power skills as well as EES operations people under Beth Apollo.  These numbers are all fluid and are not final as the NetCo deal and the people associated with it ebb and flow.  Currently, the estimate for ENW employees going to NetCo from all IT, operations and EOL operations is approximately 410.  Remaining in the estate to support non-pipeline IT and operations is approximately 453.
 
As we discussed this morning, we are trying to determine if the approximately 453 remaining ENW employees are the right number of people for the estate (EA, EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, Corp, etc.) for IT and operations as well as if they are the right people period.  We have draft org charts for estate infrastructure and estate application and are doing a skill set review of the employees in IT who are slated to stay with the estate but until NetCo is a done deal and the estate wholesale unit finalizes business plans, most of the IT estate people will be a pool of resources supporting both efforts.  Also, everyone in ENW knows which list they are on.
 
Also, we have spent money on additional hardware and a particular Unify license now (did it through Bowen and Weil as ordinary course) so that effective duplication of all wholesale applications can be completed hopefully by the end of January.  Therefore, the plan is to split ENW people out the day a NetCo deal gets done, split ownership of hardware the day a NetCo deal gets signed, agree that NetCo owns all the IP with all the Enron developed applications and they get a complete copy and the estate has a free license back in perpetuity and gets a copy of the same set of applications the day a deal gets done. We will get that duplication of all those applications done by the end of January (target date anyway). We will also begin a 6 month services agreement the day a deal gets signed.  Even though we will do the above, NetCo will still have their hardware and their applications sitting on that hardware initially in estate data centers (34 ECN, 9 ECS and Ardmore) and NetCo will also be on the estate network.  Hopefully NetCo will transition off those in that 6 months, hence the need for the services agreement.
 
We also submitted a 2002 cash budget to Corp. based on our estimate of remaining headcount, licenses, etc. but until we see what it is we are supporting, it is a placeholder.
 
Your thoughts on this?
 
Continue to include Sally in all your meetings if possible so she can coordinate the right support across your complete wholesale efforts going forward.
 
Thanks.

Greg Piper

Subject:	Background Statistics for Discussion by the Inclusiveness Committee

I attach an Excel file with some statistics on minority owned businesses in
Harris County.  A few interesting facts that we can conclude from the
charts are:

   Minorities represent 57% of Harris County population.
   Minorities own 23% of the businesses which have employees (i.e.,
   ignoring one-person businesses).
   Minority firms on average each have 40% as many employees firms of all
   ownerships in Harris County.
   Minority owned businesses generate 5% of all the sales of Harris County
   based firms.
   Revenue per employee is about half as great in minority owned businesses
   as in all businesses and compensation per employee (at around $18,700
   each) is about 60% as great at minority firms as at all firms.

Something that is not disclosed in the numbers but which would be
interesting to know is how much higher a fraction of company employees are
minorities in minority owned businesses.  Does anyone have any information
on that subject?

A couple of other interesting points that I have come across include:

   Texas is second among the states in the fraction of firms that are
   minority owned (California is first).
   Harris County is third among all counties in the U.S. in the fraction
   that its minority owned firms compose of  all statewide minority owned
   firms.

We can discuss the implications of all this information when we are
together again next week.

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know that North America included US drift in its plan and includes ""drift earnings"" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and I will do what ever you guys decide.

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed below.  In essence, John would like Enron Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please contact John Sherriff.  

Regards

Changes are required to the reporting format of Enron Europe's P/L in the Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'Enron Global Markets' heading to the 'Enron Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The Enron Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'Enron Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading:
	- J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
	- Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
	- For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.

Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good friends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get updates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do whatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more about the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their way right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, not even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these benefits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated (or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck coming in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, no medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets do something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ employees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish this.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sense of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, etc. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

"FW: Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary","I have had my head buried in budgets and am just now coming up for air!  Congratulations on your new role.

Subject:	Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary

I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

"RE: Data needed for Fallon and Delaney","LeMetrice is either a director or senior director under Jenny - kind of a second in command.  She worked extensively on the original 2002 budget for Infrastructure and put together some data on functions within the Infrastructure group that gave a somewhat layman's explanation of the various services provided.   We have already gone through the process of rebudgeting dollars and headcount for 2002, post bankruptcy and December 2 lay offs, and with the projected Netco spin off.  It is likely that LeMetrice has all of those details.  So despite a somewhat short answer from Jenny, she was actually on target to refer you to her.   -Sally

Jenny,

Whilst undestanding that you do provide shared services - could you maybe give me a little more detail on what areas you support, what offices/locations, relationship with NetCo, Wholesale, Pipelines etc...What was your allocation methodology for the 2001 budget?

My goal here - for Jim - is to understand how many bodies (& related cost) it is going to take to support the Wholesale Post Bankruptcy actvities - as we are doing for all support and commercial functions - so we can complie a fwd cash forecast.

Any education would be appreciated. An org chart would also help.

Thanks.

Barry.

Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.   They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e. EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA). 
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice.

"Project Greenlight - Additional Input?","SInce you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday during your vacation, I assume that you are perhaps out of the office today finishing that vacation.  I am certainly looking for your list of additional items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in the draft document for Project Greenlight.  I have rescheduled a meeting with Rick Buy for next Friday, October 12 at 11:30. I hope that you will be able to attend.  I want to be certain that we have enough time to review your comments and concerns, reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee members and/or project managers, and make any necessary changes or additions to the document before that meeting. 

I will be out of the office on Monday, taking Meagan to SMU for Mustang Monday - it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely enough coincides with a scheduled day at SMU for high school seniors to visit.  I will be checking my e-mails when I get home that night, however.

"Proposed Promotions - Netco","I worlked with Jeff Gosset, Stacey White and Bob Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  Tana Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.  

I mentioned to Tana that letters had been given to both Jeff Gossett and Bob Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have Jeff covered, but with the change in Bob Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  Tana was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that Bob Superty's name was submitted by Scott Neal for a promotion.  

Thanks.  --Sally

"EOL Transcation Counts - 10/22/01","This is mid-day info from EOL trades today, compared to a full day recap for the same time last month.  We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can give you a complete recap at end of day.  

Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.  If you have not talked with him, I would suggest that you do so.

Hey,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

I would be happy to sit down and discuss any plans you may (or may not have) for me. I'm a big boy - and I realise how serious this situation is.

Thanks.

Barry.

Subject:	Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan




A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us informed and in alignment.  Thanks!

"Scenarios","Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  

Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting required a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with you at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen.  

How are your 5:00 pm meetings?  

I will catch up tomorrow.  --Sally

For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.

"RE: News","Your info is right - although I do hope that all is not dark.  Wouldn't have imagined this outcome two weeks ago.  But when Bob Hall removed his name from the Netco list, timing was critical in working with potential purchasers in the auction process.  There wasn't anyone else to step in, so I did so just to help coordinate the due diligence effort and the transition.  I spent many hours with the UBS operations team last week, and they are the ones who decided that they wanted me to take the role.  It was the time that I spent with the UBS team that changed my mind about considering the role.  My reporting relationship will be to the head of American operations in Stamford, CT.  I am quite impressed with him.  The further negative news here was a factor as well.  Should be interesting.  --Sally

"FW: UK & Continental Power Doorstep","I know you are both busy.  Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.  I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.  However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.  I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

I'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.

Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.

"HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List","I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol"" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our ""to do"" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

	1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or 

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

"Follow Up","Sorry to cut the conversation short last night, but frankly I was in tears and it didn't make sense to continue the conversation.  Certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel, you should do what you think is best for you.  We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you.   My reaction last night was simply shock, because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit.  And your lead in to the conversation with ""you know we are staying at a hotel..."", was such a surprise.  Yes, you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgiving, but that was with Cindy, Richard, Brigeda, Chris and Cara staying in our home as well.  With just the two of you, and since you had said nothing to the contrary, I assumed that you would be in our home.  

What you couldn't know, of course, is the caring time that I have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room, all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend.  But it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel.  I had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet, a real bed instead of just a frame, I ironed sheets on Sunday night (something that I never do for us!) and have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room.  Certainly other guests can enjoy these things, too, but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit. 

I have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel, and again, whatever is best for you.  Sounds as if we should make that the ""norm"" from this point forward, and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone.  

I do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday.  I am planning to take the day off from work, and the plan was that David would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at Champions.  David has taken some office space near Champions, and we had planned to show you that as well.  Then we can rest (you can to do that at the hotel, if that is better for you), before having our nails done at 4:00.  But again, whatever works best for you.  Just let us know.  --Sally

I forwarded to you most of the ibuyit stuff still in my e-mail.  Please check all to see if they have been approved.  From this point forward, I don't want to automatically approve anything without my seeing it.  Please scan the rest of my e-mails to see if there is an ibuyit request that I failed to forward to you for you to check.  Please be sure that anything that has already been approved is deleted.  Thanks. 

Please go through my e-mails and print everything from Melissa Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either Rick and/or Melissa.  They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from Melissa relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then please delete all e-mails from Melissa.  

Also, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for Houston's Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from Marilyn Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these e-mails.  

E-mails from Lexi Elliott regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks.  

This effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain.  Thanks.  --Sally

	jim,

	the records group was assisting carolyn gilley and her contractor with this project.  answering questions/retrieving 	boxes/research/etc.  we do not know where her contractor left off with the project, but would be more than happy to 	provide a group to complete the project for AEP.  the enron records department handles information for all enron 	companies.  this would eliminate the learning curve if a new group were brought in.   i had asked mark thorne about 	the status of this project when i learned carolyn and her contractor had left.

	please let me know who i need to talk to regarding completion of this project.

This definitley does not sound like HPL.  I will ask around and see if anyone knows anything.  

However, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of conference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are approxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong to AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gilley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and removing the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs for the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team of contractors to complete this.

	jim,

	thanks so much for taking the time to reply.   the boxes were sent to bert stromquist from linda lyrock (EGEP, Inc.).  	i am not sure about the labeling of the boxes (HPL).  the boxes contain technical data for expl & prod for 	international areas.  

	bert was with enron global markets.  any ideas regarding these records will be helpful.

	thanks,

No.  We did have HPL boxes over that at one time and Carolyn Gilley and Earl Johnson managed the process but both are no longer here.  Can we get more specific information as to the contents and whether they are labled as HPL or not?

"RE: December Newsletter","Since this is my work e-mail address, I enjoyed a much overdue break from Enron Wednesday through Sunday, so I did not read your e-mail message until today.  I tried to open the attachment - our network operations require that the file be saved first before opening.  Did that, and what comes up looks like it is in tongues!!!  Unfortunately, I can't read anything, but hopefully Nancy was able to review it.  

I realized today that the article that Lori Ewalt gave me in hard copy at the board meeting is still in my NCL folder.  I meant to retype and get this to you in a word attachment, but frankly the hours at Enron have been horrific.  I worked the weekends of November 10 and 17 (Sat and Sun), and have had very long hours during the week - latest one on record to date was 1:00 AM last Tuesday.  Unless Lori got that article to you in another way, we are missing that from the newsletter!  

I will call you and if indeed Lori's article is not in there (not the permission form, but another article), I will contact Sally and I will simply make copies of the article to be inserted in the newsletter prior to mailing.  Sorry about this!!  

Sounds as if you had a busy Thanksgiving on top of a move as well.  Hope that you are enjoying the new place.  Too bad about the Sooners on Saturday.  David had thought about driving to Dallas next weekend for the Big 12 Championship game, but obviously won't be doing that now!  --Sally

Dear Nancy, Sally & Janet -

Did you have a wonderful Thanksgiving?  Ours was very nice; Mark's sister,
her husband and 2-year old daughter were here from California, and Mark's mom
& her husband came in from D.C. (but they stayed in a hotel!).  Luckily, our
aunt had the big dinner at her house - no trying to cook among the boxes!

Have you had an opportunity to review the December newsletter?  If so, please
let me know of any corrections or changes (Miranda gave me the corrected
minutes).  My plan is to drop it off to Sally Walker for copying first thing
Monday morning.  It will be crazy around here after noon Monday, and the
computer will be off for a few days (Monday night 'til Wednesday night or
Thursday) while we get set up in the new house . . .if the download didn't
work and you need a copy to proof, just let me know and I'll swing by with
one in the morning (our closing is not far from you, Nancy, so it won't be a
problem).

Thanks!  Robin

Hi Sally,

My name is Luis Bravo, we met about a month ago in an Associates happy hour (I'm the intern who was trying -without success- to meet with you last summer), right now I am an Associate at EES, structuring businesses. 

First of all thanks for inviting us (Associates) to join your meeting. It was a very illustrative as well as an entertaining one -nice video by the way. 

I am writing you because I am very interested in getting to know more about the Risk Management operations at Enron Networks so it would be ideal for me to meet with you to talk about it; however, if not possible in the mean time, I would also appreciate if you could give me some names of people that I could contact to so that I can get acquainted of this side of Enron Networks operations.

Thanks a lot, 

Regards,

Luis Bravo
