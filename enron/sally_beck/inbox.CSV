Subject: priorities for 1/16 and accomplishments for 1/15

1/15 - 

curve val: we have scoped the curve val project and have discussed it with PwC. I've talked to E&Y in general terms and have a meeting with them on this at 10 today. We have also had initial discussions with the different risk groups about the holes in the curve construction & upload process and our deliverable for the end of today is a list of where the holes are and a plan to fill those holes.

We spent significant time with E&Y to go over the make up of the DPR. 

We are working with the different groups on the 12/31 DPR information. So far, we have only had one request for it. My gut feeling is that EIM & ENA are complete, but ECTRIC & EGM need a bit more time. Chris should have a complete status ready for today.

Our systems are fixed (hooray!). Yesterday we caught up on the Enovate and Bridgeline DPRs as well as spent significant time with IT to get the systems fixed.

Susie is still working on the SEC VAR for 10/31, 11/30, and will start 12/31 as soon as all of the information is available. She has also started the net assets work.

Lastly, the whole group had CAS training so once we get access to the system we can start pulling info by counterparty.

 

Today our goals are:

Curve val - finalize memo (getting agreement from PwC, E&Y, and Enron estate), put listing of curve construction plan fwd, start determining what the different buckets of curves are and what tools are available to perform analysis

Field more E&Y DPR qus

Have a complete status report on the 12/31 DPR.

Prepare ongoing reporting (Enovate, Bridgeline etc).

I also hope to get some time to familarize myself with the CAS environment.

"FW: PLEASE READ - Enron Europe Risktrac Feed Summary 8 May 2001","
James is at it again.  He actually stated in the meeting this morning in front of Rick Buy that this is all IT and that they have no control over IT.(Stupid comment) Rick buy just said, privately, I bet if we cut back their limits they will prioritize these problems.

As you can see they had more failures today, even after my call with Fernley yesterday.  And tomorrow is their deadline to turn on VAR for RiskTRAC

I have a conf call in the morning with Mike, James AND Fernley to discuss status, etc.

I am also giving Rick Causey a quick update on the situation at 10am tomorrow.  I left him a voicemail as a heads up yesterday, and he said he wanted a quick update.  

This morning I think Rick Buy was a little happier, as I let James have it a little in the meeting and told him in no uncertain terms that they needed to fix this.

sending an email around should not be the solution.  They just need to get this crap right!  Will work on them tomorrow.

I'll continue to keep you posted

Subject:	PLEASE READ - Enron Europe Risktrac Feed Summary 8 May 2001

In order to provide greater clarity around the issues we face on providing a daily feed to RiskTrac, to minimise the potential for miss communication and to remove the need for those attending the daily conference call to scribble away when Europe is outlining the reasons for failure, we will provide a daily written summary to the above list. 

We will aim to produce this by 1pm London time on a t+1 basis which is 1 1/2 hours before the daily conference call which should allow all concerned time to review prior to that call.

We have adopted the definition of failure as not having the daily data loaded into RiskTrac by 6am Houston time which is the time the corporate VAR is run. Times will be taken from the RiskTrac intranet site (http://risktracfeed.corp.enron.com) which is clearly visible to everyone. 

It should be remembered that we in Europe (Risk and IT) only control the process to the point where data is moved to RiskTrac. From there is needs to be processed by RiskTrac in Houston and we have no control over the time this takes. On days like today where the Nordic feed took 75minutes to process we may well fail based on the above definition. Failure to meet the 6am Houston deadline does not necessarily meant that we will be unable to calculate book VAR or produce the daily DPR that day it is just that we have failed to provide the positions and prices for the 6am corporate VAR run.

Please get back to me if there are any comments.

James

Kerry,

As you are probably aware, the EES Risk Control organization is moving under Sally as of April 30, 2001.  Our initial thought was we would keep all the former EES employees together in a new ENA accounting entity, but have now decided that the Risk Control group needs to be captured as part of Enron NetWorks.  These were previously set up under a new ENA company number (#1596).  I don't know if within SAP we can simply repoint the profit and cost centers set up below to roll-up under ENW now instead of ENA, if not, we will need five new ones set up as follows:

	Executive (Meredith Eggleston)-27101 [Simper, Keith]  ,150260
	Risk Analytics (Neil Hong)-27102 [Simper, Keith]  ,150261 
	Strategic Operations, Process & Systems (Scott Mills)-27103 [Simper, Keith]  150262

"Post Mortem on credit reserve issue","Here is a summary of what happened with the recent credit reserve issue.

Problem
On 9/19/01 credit ran their reporting for 8/31/01 and noted the credit reserve numbers appeared to be overstated by $100 million.

Reason
In a nutshell, what occurred was that Debbie, Matthew, & my group were going through portfolios and determining which ones to delete (work started in end August).
The decision was made to run the reserves off a AGG Credit instead of the old ECT portfolio (which was no longer being maintained after the creation of the new portfolios needed for the new risk policy).  I believe this is what led to the increase in the credit reserve. The question came up last Wednesday because Mark Ruane had been out of the office and with him gone, credit had not been running their daily processes (which would have caught the increase at the time of the portfolio switch over).
When the numbers came out, Debbie ran some queries and determined 188 books were missing from the AGG Credit portfolio.  This isn't surprising, as that was not a portfolio we (or anyone) maintained.
To help credit out, we added the 188 books, but the reserve numbers did not come down to expectations. After further review, we determined that it was because intermonth books were included in the AGG Credit portfolio.  
Last night we again worked with credit to put a temporary solution in place which ended up being creating yet another portfolio without the intermonth books.

I am yet to hear what the number came out to be, but hopefully the 8/31 numbers came out okay (it takes 15 hours to run).

What we are doing
1) Keith is working on documenting all 135 root portfolios as to user, maintainer, reason for use.  The end goal will be for us to get users to use the production portfolios we maintain and create new roles within risktRAC so groups who cannot use our portfolios can maintain their own.  The message below lays out our key goals.

2) Working with Debbie (see note below) about using a portfolio for the credit reserve that is actively maintained.

Best regards

Shona

Subject:	credit reserves

Dear Debbie,

My group did a bit of brainstorming around portfolios and I wanted to share this info.  I'd like to talk to you about these items sometime this week.

1) We are trying to minimize the portfolios that need to be separately managed.  Keith is starting to work through all of the root portfolios and determine (among other things) the current users of each portfolio and whether these users can use a production portfolio.  The next step will be to ensure that the appropriate roles are defined so that different groups can maintain their own portfolio.  We will then transition the maintenance of these portfolios to the user groups.*

2) The users of all portfolios (including the credit reserve portfolio) need to come up with a description of the data needs from their portfolio.  Risk Analytics will not be responsible for defining user requirements around any portfolio (although we will can give input as to what is currently there).

3) Based on our initial discussions, it looks like the credit reserve portfolio needs all books with the exception of intermonth and EEL.  We would like to find a way for the credit reserve to use the same processes as Infinity.  What Infinity does is pick up books from the production portfolio and then excludes certain books from Clara's list of ""exceptions"".

4) The reason I copied Ramesh & John on this is because we were thinking that it might be possible to have the book type indicated in risktrac so that the credit reserve queries can automatically exclude these books from the query.  That way credit would not have to maintain a manual list of exceptions to their queries.  This is something we may also be able to get to work for Infinity.

Is there someone in credit we can work with to take a look at this proposed process?

Thanks

Shona

*To note, there are some other user requirements around needing to sever links between different root portfolios.

We need to pull together a list of all non-residential real estate leases for premises used by EGM and its businesses. 

To date, I have identified five such leases, listed below by address and landlord: 

(1) 2103 Southlake Blvd., Southlake, Texas (Comercis, Inc.) 
(2) 500 Lee Street East, Charleston, West Virginia (Laidley Developers Limited Partnership) 
(3) 780 Third Avenue, New York, New York (TIAA) 
(4) Penn Center West, Bldg Two, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Penn Center Management Corp.) 
(5) 150 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL  60601 (BfG Immobilien-Investment Gesellschaft mbH Ltd.) 

Please let me know ASAP if you are aware of ANY leased premises held or used by EGM or its related businesses that is not on the above list.  While all of the above leases are office leases, we need a complete list of ALL non-residential real estate leases (including warehouse leases, land leases, etc.).  Please be overinclusive in responding to this information request, as I am including premises that EGM shares with other Enron business units and is charged an allocation.

As Beth states below, EGA will go with Heidi and take the ball to make sure all the issues are resolved.

Again, we appreciate Heidi and her extra effort and Beth working with us on this issue.

Subject:	Action plan on Seoul Issue from recent Doorstep

We had a conference call this afternoon to discuss the next steps
(Participants:  Beth, Shona, David Port, Jeff Sommers, John Bergren(EAS),  Heidi Mason (person who did Seoul Doorstep from Australia), Darrell Kinder (in charge of the Enron Seoul office and the SK relationship))

The net result of our discussion was that Heidi will be making another trip to Seoul (in 2 weeks) to scope out the deals since the inception of the JV (Jan 99) and to validate that the assumptions that she made in her analysis are correct.  One of Jeff Sommers' people from Houston will accompany her in order to meet some of the people there and take a hand off from Heidi(since she has a day job in Australia)in terms of following up to see that these issues are resolved.

Major Issues to be looked at on round 2:   -- see further detail from Heidi below
1.  Figure out if SK Gas really is intentionally running unprofitable transactions thru the JV with their 100% owned entity SK Global  and quantify(note the $.5mm below is on 		an accrual basis not MTM)
2. Emphasize the need to both the JV and to Enron SK that they need to formalize a trading policy(brought up by AA in the doorstep they did a year ago)
3.  Take a deeper look at their International sales(outside of Seoul) as there are much fewer controls in place; credit issues could be a problem
4.   Propose some regular reporting that should go to the Enron JV people to monitor transations and improve communication


I know Heidi is not thrilled about going back(she had to eat meals with locals who were eating eye balls!)and she is very busy running the Australian operations and back office, but knows that this is an important issue.  Darrell Kinder feels like she will get the best results.    Fernley, just an FYI to you, so that you know she will be heading back there for a few days.

Jeff and I will schedule a seperate download session with the 3 of you for the SK Gas JV once the next trip is complete.

Preliminary to tomorrow's call I have been talking to Darrell about the additional work that we need to look to do at SK Gas.

At a minimum, the things I believe we need to do are:

Obtain details of the profitability of all affiliated company deals for the period since inception of the JV.  I have received from SK Gas a break-up of the total P+L for 2000 by transaction type. It is the Cargo trading as per below that we are interested in. Overall there appears to be little movement therefore in the net profit for the year to 31/12/2000 v the rolling 12 months we have. 

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 

The data that we have for May 2000 to April 2001 indicates a total loss for trading with SK Global of approx 0.5mn and this is after the inclusion of the one large profit deal that made 0.5mn. Without that deal the loss would have been 1mn dollars versus a profit of 1.8mn on trades with independant counterparties, which is the main reason why we feel we need to further assess these deals further. Regardless of the outcome of the testing however, we need a better process to allow for a current review of these deals either before or when they are done, in line with the JV agreement. 

We need to determine from SK Gas, their trading policy, be this written or verbal. There may perhaps be a reason why the deals with SK Global show a more frequent loss if, for example, SK Global take shipments that SK Gas can not sell elsewhere ie a buyer of the last resort? Without knowing the policy it is very hard to come to any clear conclusions as to the trend seen to date. 											
We need to review the circumstances of some of the larger SK Global deals to try and assess why they were loss making trades. Again, without knowing the trading policy and doing the review so far in arrears, makes it difficult to effectively review all the circumstances of the trade. Therefore, going forward we need to ensure that we implement a policy that ensures SK Corp staff are able to review these trades as they occur when the market factors are more to hand. 

I have discussed with Darrell the option of using resources closer to hand to resolve this, but appreciate his comments that due to the sensitive nature of the arrangements, this will be less than ideal. At the same time, I am not available until the week of the 18th, so timing may also be an issue. Allan Ford is not available to come with me, but I do have an additional resource from Australia if required. Again, there may be an option to use someone else from the region, or AAs who we will need as translators anyway.

Happy to get all feedback and ideas on this plan for tomorrow as I want to have the most comprehensive work plan possible in place before we leave to ensure the visit is as efficient as possible. 

Thanks

Heidi

"Retention Payments et al","
Guys, I want to clear up a couple of points:
	a) if you had received a retention payment in early December with a date that expires Feb 28 - that retention payment will not be at risk in any way if you do not work for NETCO or if you choose to join the effort towards NewCo. That payment was made on behalf of the Enron estate to ensure critical operations  are completed and  key people are retained;
	b) we are working to provide, as per our discussion this am, a new retention package for estate (and NewCo) employees for the next 90 days that should be forthcoming in the next several weeks;
	c) you are not in breach of your employement agreement by working towards NewCo versus Netco or the overall estate regardless of which company wrote or sponsored your original contract (ie) ENA , EES, EGM, etc.  These are all Enron assets; and
	d) I envision that NewCo upon it formation will have its own compensation plan which will provide competitive base salaries, a bonus program consistent or better than Enron's or possibly similar to what is being discussed about Netco, an equity participation plan, employment agreements and a competitive benefits package.

By copy to Jeff McMahon, I wanted everyone to know this is consistent with the overall message that I have been receiving.

Regards
Delainey

Options Report
Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms for Tax Losses
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C11

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain extremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price for option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston company sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled investors. 
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet session Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate income. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a three-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dynegy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compared with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE. 
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially identical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates. 
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the wash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money put, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor. 
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buying additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stock.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal. 
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year. 
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said. 
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each. 
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enron. 
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit. 
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set. 
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was. 
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy. 
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price. 
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings. 
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario"" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share. 
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of Enron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was above $80 a share. 
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could ""recover the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading operations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote. 
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-law filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,"" said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one notch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it believed Enron's trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls"" in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contributing to ""liquidity pressures."" 
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spokeswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the merger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alternatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron said it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sued by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses because of Enron's plummeting stock price. 
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misled participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks, the company ""locked down"" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, because of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has been costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% of the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, according to one of the suits. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesday by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification. 
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A spokeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 investment choices, one of which is company stock. 
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information. 
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. The suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending. 
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to the 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an investment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the end of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison. 
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harrison & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's decline. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril. 
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In addition, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the SEC. 
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's stock. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" Mr. Rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers. ""I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything."" 
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50. 
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Generally, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary duties, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities. 
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LLP, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Gotto Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ikon Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing Ms. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright. 
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Representatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employees to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for diversification. 
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day after Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.01 billion in the third quarter, Enron ""locked down"" the 401(k) plan's assets, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A ""lock-down"" occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't make changes in their investment choices). 
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth said. 
""They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announcing some really bad news,"" Mr. Barth said. ""Mr. Rinard's looking at having no retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in your 50s.""

From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen partner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Management case. 
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Arthur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry? 
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know more than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said this week. 
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead. 
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong. But they can add up. 
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 million over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a related party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not clear if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time. 
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing partner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the table was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules. 
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior people at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looked the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says he acted properly. 
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits. 
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting. 
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the public of that.

Chase and J. P. Morgan's Paper Anniversary
A Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet Reality
By RIVA D. ATLAS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

When William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year's $31 billion merger of J. P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build a giant of the banking business. 
''This is the first merger I've been part of,'' said Mr. Harrison, the chief executive of the combined bank, ''where I feel our core business is complete.''
The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investment banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportunities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largely dried up for now. 
Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already speculating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet another large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy emphasis on Wall Street. 
J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the revampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the beleaguered energy trading company. 
But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as both lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual role it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. With Enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidden debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track. 
Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fell by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more than other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes. 
''The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chase's stock, he said, because ''expectations are very low.'' 
All J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wall Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a strong moneymaker this year. 
Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By contrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from consumer businesses. 
''The timing of the merger was bad,'' said Steven Wharton, a banking analyst at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chase shares. ''There's no disputing that.'' 
Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about having done this merger,'' he said in a recent interview. ''While there are pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.'' 
In Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who have worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top spots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by managers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, where he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's merger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold last year. 
The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finance and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial officer. 
Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment banking chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by NationsBank. 
''There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Harrison and his team,'' said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Advisors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical. 
Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations. 
''In general, mergers are very hard on morale,'' she said. ''There is no question that this one has a tougher emotional toll.'' 
The bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have taken advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks' staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merger was announced. 
Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Morgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year. 
''We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,'' Ms. Dublon said. 
In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr. Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain about changes in their jobs. ''People have fewer options,'' he said, ''so you have a little more control over the process.'' 
Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cutting will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2 billion at the time of the merger. 
The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the bank's core businesses. ''What we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company,'' Ms. Dublon said in a conference call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced. 
Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the bank's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to market-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. Morgan Chase will hold on to these gains. 
The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and acquisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals. 
The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-place finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data. 
The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignments providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for loans. 
Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, despite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 billion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to advise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken over by Dynegy. 
The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at leading the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain. Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go around. 
The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds, another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger. It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with sixth place a year ago. 
The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase raised $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in the largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record. 
Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offerings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor. 
The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of stock, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6th-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.) 
Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock offerings to build momentum slowly in that business. ''We think we have a chance in the second half of this year to be in the top five,'' he said. 
Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolster weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division. 
''The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enough,'' one investment banker said. 
Mr. Harrison disagrees: ''I don't feel,'' he said, ''we need to do another large deal to be successful.''

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron 'awaiting' capital injections, say officials.
By ROBERT CLOW.

11/23/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Officials working to shore up Enron's balance sheet yesterday said the struggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than $1.5bn as early as next week. 
Enron is in talks about $250m investments with JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup and is also hoping to raise at least $1bn from private equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish to invest in Enron. However, the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be talking to the company before Dynegy made its $9bn rescue bid, is understood no longer to be doing so. 
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt until after the completion of the merger. 
The moves comes as reports from Goldman Sachs and Fitch, the credit rating agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-term viability. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were inadequate to meet $2.8bn of debt obligations falling due before the end of the year. 
People close to Enron say that nearly $1bn of that debt has already been restructured. 
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed, Enron would struggle to meet $9bn of obligations due before the end of next year. 
People close to Enron insisted that Dynegy remained committed to the merger and played down talk of renegotiation. 
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the deal, they predicted.

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow.

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(dateline previous NEW YORK, changes byline, updates with bond prices, details throughout) 
By C. Bryson Hull
HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A long weekend of work faced Dynegy Inc. and proposed acquisition Enron Corp.,, whose worsening stock woes on Friday whipped up fear that the deal could be renegotiated or collapse entirely. 
Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holiday weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival Enron's complex books, as both parties race against the decline in Enron's stock to complete the thorough financial examinations a merger requires. 
Enron shares ended down more than 5 percent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the close of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy shares closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 percent, to $40.40. 
Dynegy on Nov. 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, after falling 45 percent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out of cash before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about $4.03 billion. 
At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is worth about $10.85 a share - more than twice Enron's current share price. 
Executives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the review, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sources said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday afternoon, and that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence review is finished. 
But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as a ""material adverse change"" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases of Dynegy invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers say. 
""You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spread on the deal,"" said one analyst. ""There's unquestionably continued malaise in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with Enron."" 
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a research report that the likelihood was ""soaring"" that Dynegy might discover a material adverse change. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her knowledge, Dynegy was not renegotiating the terms of the acquisition. 
She repeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet. 
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the company remains optimistic about the merger. 
TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more likely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a move they said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy. 
This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped away from the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy filing was highly possible. 
Traders, speaking on condition on anonymity, said they expected Dynegy to scramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap. Enron's depleted market value and the shrinking volume in its EnronOnline trading system makes it more likely Dynegy could pull out, traders said. 
Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-term deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company's credit rating would soon improve. 
Enron's bonds on Friday were again talked at junk-bond levels, but even lower than before. 
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 percent notes were bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respective 21.5 percent and 17 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents. 
Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers wonder how Enron has avoided it. 
""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion in debt and does not own Enron.

USA: Enron avoids junk status, but observers wonder how.
By Jonathan Stempel

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - It is rare that holding onto investment-grade credit ratings means as much to a company as it does now to beleaguered energy trader Enron Corp. , and some observers are wondering why a cut to junk status is taking so long. 
""The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. ""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security.""
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes were bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, a trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 percent and 17 percent. 
Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 percent this year. Since October 16, when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downward, its shares have fallen 86 percent, and its bonds by nearly half. 
Houston-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle. 
Its advisers were expected this weekend to pore over the company's books, which could lead to a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the matter said. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecured debt ratings twice in the last month to their current ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating to ""BBB-minus,"" and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts. 
The stakes could hardly be higher. 
CASH CRUNCH 
A downgrade to ""junk"" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said. 
Enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of available cash and credit lines. 
S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces ""liquidity issues,"" but enjoys an ""alignment of interests"" with its banks and a near-term financial position that ""is expected to be sufficient"" to allow the Dynegy merger. 
Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that ""our present 'BBB-minus' rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks."" 
If Dynegy walks away, it said, ""Enron's credit situation seems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible."" 
Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next year, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later said it got a three-week reprieve. 
INVESTMENT BANKS 
Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. in Philadelphia, likened Enron's ratings situation to those of California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison . 
Despite investor unease, those utilities kept their investment-grade ratings only until they defaulted on debt in January, as California's power crisis worsened. 
On November 8, a day before the Dynegy merger was announced, senior officials from Enron's lead banks - William Harrison, chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , and Michael Carpenter, who runs Citigroup Inc.'s investment banking arm - met with Moody's to help allay that agency's concerns, a person familiar with the meeting said. 
A day later, Moody's, which issued no statement on Enron this week, downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt rating, but only to its current ""Baa3."" 
""Pressure is coming from the investment banks, which have a vested interest in seeing the Dynegy deal go through,"" said Egan, whose agency rates Enron's debt ""BB,"" its second-highest junk grade. ""Investment banking fees will be substantial."" 
Companies pay for Moody's and S&P ratings, which they need to obtain financing. Egan said his agency receives no such payments. 
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Moody's and S&P did not immediately return phone calls. Fitch was not immediately available for comment. Dynegy and Enron on Wednesday, however, reaffirmed their commitment to the merger. 
Wells Capital's Smith isn't sure what to expect. 
""Enron will remain definitively investment grade if the merger as billed goes through, ... but there are half a dozen things that could go wrong,"" he said. ""Obviously, the equity markets are telling you it's very skeptical the merger will go through, and the bond market is following its lead.""

USA: US Corp Bonds-Enron slips again in quiet market.
By Jonathan Stempel

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market saw very little activity on Friday, with many traders leaving even in advance of the early close, though Enron Corp.'s bonds weakened for a third straight session amid concern over the energy trader's liquidity, and whether its merger with Dynegy Inc. can go through. 
""Deadly"" was how one trader described activity. Spreads, the yield difference between investment-grade bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, finished unchanged on balance, as did junk bond prices, traders said.
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 percent notes were bid at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respective 21.5 percent and 17 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents. 
Meanwhile, Enron's shares fell 5.4 percent, as its advisers prepared this weekend to pore over the company's books, sources familiar with the matter said. Analysts said there could be a renegotiation of the Dynegy merger. 
""The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion of debt, none from Enron. ""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security."" 
Ten-year Treasuries closed down 12/32, as their yields rose to 5.011 percent. 
JUNK BOND FUNDS ENJOY INFLOWS 
Separately, investors poured cash into U.S. junk bond mutual funds for a second straight week amid a newfound tolerance for riskier assets. 
Investors added a net $628.5 million of cash to the funds in the week ending Tuesday, on top of $816.3 million in the prior week, according to AMG Data Services. 
The two-week inflow is the largest since the second and third week of January. The bonds rose more than 6 percent that month, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. 
""Financial markets have rallied on hopes that the economy will get better in the not-too-distant future,"" said Jan Hatzius, senior economist at Goldman Sachs & Co. ""A lot of the optimism right now is hope rather than reality, but we should see signs of improvement in a month or two."" 
Through Thursday, junk bonds have returned 2.93 percent in November alone, beating all other bonds, and are up 4.71 percent this year, Merrill Lynch data show. The bonds still yield 7.98 percentage points more than Treasuries, but that's down from 9.29 percentage points at the start of the month. 
Companies this week sold about $3.83 billion of investment-grade, $533 million of junk, and $3.3 billion of convertible debt. Investors expect about three more weeks of overall active issuance before the usual year-end slowdown.

USA: Enron shares seesaw on concerns over Dynegy deal.

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. fluctuated wildly on Friday morning, as concerns grew over rival Dynegy Inc.'s $9 billion acquisition of the beleaguered energy trader. 
Enron shares were down 8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $4.93 in Friday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after diving more than 8 percent earlier.
The shares are down because of talk that the terms of Dynegy's deal with Enron could be changed or that the deal could collapse. 
Dynegy originally agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, after falling 42 percent since then by Wednesday's close, Enron now sports a market capitalization of only about $4.26 billion. 
In a report on Wednesday, Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg, suggested that the deal's current exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy for each share of Enron could well be readjusted. 
He suggested that a much lower exchange ratio of 0.15 was more realistic. 
""You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spread on the deal,"" said one analyst, referring to a potential renegotiation. 
""There's unquestionably continued malaise in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with Enron,"" he continued. 
Some of Enron's trading partners have scaled back their activity, causing that ""malaise."" Lower volumes at its trading business, which is the largest and most coveted portion of its operation, could cause fourth-quarter earnings to come in below expectations, Enron has said.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong. 
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting ""the perfect storm"" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001.
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron."" 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he said. ""I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility."" 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,"" he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,"" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
""One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,"" O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

U.S. Energy Exhange May Scrap Online Platform Plans
By Stephen Parker
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The world's largest energy futures exchange is taking a second look at plans to launch a major new electronic trading platform known as eNymex, and may decide to scrap them. 
Management changes at the New York Mercantile Exchange, along with the success of Access, an online platform the exchange expanded in September, have prompted the move.
Nymex may decide to combine parts of eNymex with Access, according to sources close to the matter. It is also exploring the idea of alliances with other exchanges, and considering developing ""e-mini"" contracts - smaller energy contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors. 
""There's new management in place at the exchange,"" said Nymex spokeswoman Nachamah Jacobovits. ""They're rethinking all of our business strategies, and one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products."" 
Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on building the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work on the project. 
Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back end of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project after GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is ""substantially complete, but the company can't speak to Nymex's overall electronic-trading strategy,"" a Kiodex source said. 
The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter energy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading some of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expanded in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delivery at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said. 
""We've expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract,"" Jacobovits said. ""Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based platform, which is a factor in that decision."" 
Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, after the day's Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with dedicated phone systems. 
The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access trading over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up trade to more users. 
The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex's building, located near where the trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Expanding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease potential liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading hours after Nymex reopened. 
Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of former Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Robert ""Bo"" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still expected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original product line. 
If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNymex with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex. 
""eNymex right now is looking for a new mission,"" said an industry source close to Nymex. ""You know how politics works. We don't scrap it, we just rename it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done."" 
Nymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid change. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen their luck turn - in opposite directions. 
Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enron's possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, and energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company. 
Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When Enron's troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clearing services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the trading community saw as an attempt to grab market share. 
ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy trade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex's chief competitor and Europe's largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE energy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services for some over-the-counter contracts. 
Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on CME's Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said. 
Nymex officials wouldn't confirm whether they're talking with the CME, but they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one. 
""Nymex is always open to strategic alliances,"" Jacobovits said. ""There's nothing we've agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a number of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them."" 
Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nymex trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products on its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.

Enron Woes May Endanger Plans For Mozambique Steel Proj

11/23/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP)--The recent downturn in fortunes for U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) may quash hopes for the construction of a natural gas-fueled factory to produce steel slabs for export in Mozambique, officials said Friday. 
One of the largest companies in the U.S., Enron is struggling amid potentially new cash-flow and earnings problems. The Houston-based company was to invest $1.1 billion in the Maputo Iron and Steel Project, a factory that once built, was expected to produce two million tons of steel slabs a year.
But Mozambican Prime Minister Pacoal Mocumbi said that the government hoped that, ""Enron's current difficulties will not lead to the cancellation of the project."" 
""My government wants to know from Enron what is going on so that we are not held hostage to a lack of information,"" Mocumbi said. 
No immediate comment was available from Enron officials in Mozambique. 
The planned project is part of long-standing efforts to exploit vast natural gas reserves in Mozambique and transport and sell the product into the industrial heartland of South Africa. 
Mozambique has two massive gas fields: Temane is operated by the U.S.'s Atlantic Richfield Co., Sasol of South Africa, and Zarara Petroleum of Dubai, while Pande is operated by Enron.

STOCKWATCH Enron down, Dynegy up on lingering merger uncertainty

11/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp shares were lower, while Dynegy Inc was slightly higher in late morning trade on lingering uncertainty about their proposed merger following a news report that Enron's SEC filing last Monday contained details that were not known to acquirer Dynegy, dealers said. 
At 11.15 am, Enron shares were trading down 17 cents at 4.84, a decline of 3.3 pct. Dynegy was up 44 cents at 40.20.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed source as saying Monday's SEC filing contained information on the company which was unknown to proposed buyer Dynegy. 
Dynegy representatives are planning to work through the weekend evaluating the significance of this information as part of their due diligence on Enron, the paper said. It did not specify the nature of the information. 
In the filing, Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
On Wednesday, the company said it had received an extension on the repayment until mid-December, which it said was enough time to restructure the debt. 
The company also said it was in active talks with its creditors and expected to be able to restructure other debt and remain solvent long enough for the merger with Dynegy to be completed. 
Dynegy welcomed the news and said it will push ahead in seeking regulatory approval for the merger. But investors are concerned that the constant surprises in restated earnings and revelations of liquidity problems at Enron may cause Dynegy to walk away from the deal. 
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone lowered Enron's fourth-quarter earnings per share estimate to a loss of 25 cents from earnings of 25 cents, arguing that its business will suffer until its liquidity problems are resolved. 
The analyst cut his full year estimate to 1.10 usd from 1.60 usd and 2002 estimate to 75 cents from 1.65 cents. 
If his figures prove to be correct, they would make Dynegy's current merger exchange terms -- of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for each Enron share owned -- moderately dilutive. 
""We reiterate that if the merger with Dynegy were to run into obstacles (or fall through entirely) Enron shares could come under severe pressure as investors may question its ability to sustain liquidity (and normal business activities) for an extended period of time,"" Barone said in a note. ""Under such a scenario, bankruptcy would not be out of the question."" 
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer was more upbeat, and said the share's decline in recent sessions has been overdone. 
""Our industry contacts and discussions with traders indicate that while trading with Enron has slowed, it certainly has not stopped,"" said Launer. 
For Dynegy, the merger with Enron still ""represents a dramatic plus,"" he said.

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and diverse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of the city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., economists and analysts said. 
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and is in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third major employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent months. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attacks and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if finalized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July. 
""It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Continental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in the grand scope of the Houston economy,"" said Phil Scheps, director of Houston's finance and administration department. 
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energy giant's market share has steadily eroded. 
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of layoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs ""will be spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."" 
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's efforts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenue collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. ""We're watching to see where things go now,"" she said. 
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. ""While Enron is certainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what the impact would be."" 
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdown since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nation. 
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the Texas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax base is estimated to grow to $95 billion. 
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the initial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the city to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent. That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 billion budget. 
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small change in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very large, Scheps said. 
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence has quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenue collections will be available in February when the city receives data for the December holiday season, Scheps said.

Dabhol Power Co. initiated the arbitration against the state government for not honoring its guarantees on power bills due for December 2000 and January, following Maharashtra State Electricity Board's failure to meet payments. 
The Singapore meeting is likely to be followed by the actual arbitration process in the London court, according to a Friday report in the Hindu Business Line daily. 
The panel, which has been appointed by DPC and the Maharashtra state government, includes an independent observer.

Enron SEC filing contained information Dynegy was unaware of - report

11/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Monday's SEC filing by Enron's Corp contained information that proposed buyer Dynegy Inc had not known about, the Wall Street Journal quoted a person familiar with the merger plans as saying. 
Dynegy representatives plan to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence on Enron, the source said, without specifying what the new information was. 
In the filing, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than 2 bln usd in loans by the end of the year.
Dynegy announced Wednesday that it is working to accelerate regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition in accordance with the previously announced agreement. 
The Journal quoted analysts as saying Dynegy is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the deal. 
It also cited Fitch director Ralph Pellecchia as saying that, without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible"".

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (ENE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year. 
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said. 
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each. 
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enron. 
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit. 
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set. 
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was. 
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy. 
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price. 
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings. 
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario"" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share.

Employees' Lawuit Says Enron Hurt Retirement Funds Courts: The suit claims the energy firm urged workers to invest in company stock just before it plunged.
From Associated Press

11/23/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
C-2
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endangered their retirement funds. 
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Houston under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, asserts that Enron encouraged the employees to invest more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit was filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker Steve Lacey.
Enron shares have plunged more than 90% over the last several months since the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controversy that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating more than $580 million of reported income. 
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle, said Enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into Enron stock. 
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berman, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action. 
Berman wants to prove that the company's 401(k) plan executives failed to act responsibly when they knew about serious business problems. He's also hoping to break new legal ground with his case. 
The lawsuit is patterned after a case against Lucent Technologies in which Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) contributions with company stock that tanked. That case is still in litigation. 
Earlier this year, Rinard, 54, had $472,000 in his Enron 401(k) plan, which had been growing for 21 years. 
Today, his plan is worth about $40,000. Enron gives its employees their 401(k) match in company stock. 
In January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard, saw Enron's stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire account into Enron stock. 
Enron executives had talked about how the stock price was poised to climb above $100 a share, Rinard told the Houston Chronicle. 
In addition, Enron employees were not allowed to make trades in the 401(k) plan for about a month, starting Oct. 17. That was the day after Enron surprised the market with the news it was taking a $1.01-billion after-tax third-quarter charge to get out of bad investments. 
Enron officials, who could not be reached, have said they had planned the lockdown for several months because the company was changing plan administrators.

LOS ANGELES -- Oregon's largest utility, Portland General Electric, faces an uncertain future as its parent Enron fights for its life amid a deepening financial crisis, industry experts said Wednesday. 
Another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, is due to file next week with state regulators for approval to take over Portland General. Those same regulators could soon be faced with a similar application from Dynegy as part of a still-pending deal to acquire cash-strapped Enron.
If Enron were to file for bankruptcy before Portland General has been sold, its future could be thrown into the hands of a Texas bankruptcy court, experts said. 
Northwest Natural Gas agreed Oct. 8 to acquire Portland General for around $1.8 billion, plus about $1.1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock. A month later, Enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by Houston-based Dynegy. 
""We've been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale (Portland General's acquisition by Northwest Natural Gas),"" said Roy Hemmingway, chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. 
""We have authority if that sale doesn't go through to rule on whether Dynegy can take over Enron,"" he said. 
Ratings agency Fitch last week cut Portland General's debt ratings due to ""uncertainty at its parent Enron."" Wednesday, the same agency said a bankruptcy filing by Enron was ""highly possible"" if the proposed rescue by Dynegy collapses. 
""We haven't seen any credit problems so far, and Portland General isn't in the market (buying power for its customers) right now in a big way,"" Hemmingway said. 
However, he noted that, ""If they really were unable to conduct their business because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instruments are available"" to make sure service to customers is maintained. Earlier this year, California was forced to take over buying power for the PG&E unit of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International subsidiary Southern California Edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to junk status. 
Federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the right to sell to a creditworthy buyer. 
California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, chose to file for bankruptcy because of its mounting debt. In a parallel, consumer advocates fear the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring Oregon could end up in the hands of a bankruptcy judge. 
Hemmingway said the Oregon Public Utility Commission recently had granted Portland General a rate increase and the utility has ""plenty of cash flow currently to handle its obligations."" 
""This is nothing like California where that was not the case,"" he said. 
Northwest Natural Gas, which is also based in Portland, has set a target of filing next Wednesday with the Oregon commission to take over the utility, spokesman Steve Sechrist said. 
""We have no concerns whatsoever at this point. The deal is moving forward and there is no reason we can see why it should not"" he said, noting the delay to the filing was the result of the complexities of the acquisition. 
Jason Eisdorfer, a lawyer for the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon, said major questions would be raised if Enron went under before the deal were completed. 
""Would the (bankruptcy) judge let the terms of the agreement go forward. I don't know. There is a risk that Portland General will become an asset to be disposed of under bankruptcy,"" Eisdorfer said.

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)

     (Updates with Dynegy comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds
fell for a third day on concern the company's weakened financial
condition and plunging stock price may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to
cancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader.

     Shares of Enron, the most-active U.S. stock, dropped
30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.71. They fell 45 percent Tuesday and
Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than $9 billion
in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4 percent bonds due in July 2006 were
bid at 55 cents on the dollar, down from 62 cents on Wednesday,
traders said.

     Enron shares are trading at less than half the value of
Dynegy's offer, which shows investors are questioning whether the
buyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago.
Enron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on Dynegy's earnings
next year if the transaction is completed, analysts said.

     ``There are continued doubts about the deal,'' said UBS
Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy''
and doesn't own shares in either company. ``Enron's earnings
aren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business.
Given that, Dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price.''

     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company ``remains
optimistic for the potential of the merger.'' Enron agreed Nov. 9
to the takeover, now valued at about $23 billion in stock and
assumed debt, after a financial crisis threatened it with
bankruptcy.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due next week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.

     More than 40 million Enron shares changed hands today, almost
twice their three-month daily average, in a session shortened
because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Enron was the most-active
U.S. stock on Wednesday, with 116 million shares traded. Dynegy
shares rose 64 cents to $40.40 today.

                       Less Than $2 Billion

     In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Monday, Enron
said it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If
the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron is in danger of
seeing its credit rating cut below investment grade. That would
trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated
partnerships.

     Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in
a bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injection
of as much as $2 billion, the New York Times reported yesterday,
citing unidentified executives close to the companies.

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking
$500 million to $1 billion. Enron needs to raise $1 billion to
$1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days, said Sean Egan,
managing director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.

     ``Their trading operation has burned through cash faster than
the market had expected,'' Egan said.

                         Trading Business

     Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said they
shifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stock
price prompted concerns about creditworthiness. Enron has said
fourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its
energy-trading business.

     Watson said after the Enron buyout was announced he expected
it to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent. Analysts said that
can't happen unless Enron recovers lost trading business. Several
have cut their 2002 estimates for Enron. The average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call for next year is
now $1.68 a share, down from $2.14 a month ago.

     Dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if Enron can't meet debt
payments, its trading market collapses, banks demand more
collateral or raise the interest rate for loans, Enron's credit
rating is cut to junk, the SEC cites Enron for securities fraud,
or if Enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed
$3.5 billion, Egan said.


                     Will Dynegy Renegotiate?

     Dynegy officials were considering whether to try and
renegotiate terms of its agreement with Enron, according to the
New York Times report. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.

     ``Dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a
lower price for Enron,'' said Credit Lyonnais securities analyst
Gordon Howald, who rates Dynegy ``buy'' and owns no shares.

     Under the Nov. 9 terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy share for each share held. At today's closing price, that
values Enron stock at $10.85. A year ago, Enron traded at almost
$80.

     Investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push
Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``The market is saying there seems to be no obvious Plan B
for Enron and that is what has investors concerned,'' said Eric
Bergson, who helps manage $9 billion of fixed-income assets at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The lower bond prices go, what
the market is saying is that there's less chance of this deal
going through.''

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says
2001-11-23 16:20 (New York)

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &
Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among the
likely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp. for a private
equity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet, said
industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.

     The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy
companies in the past. An investment in Enron may look attractive
now that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year.

     ``Many of the larger, more traditional buyout firms would
find this deal attractive,'' said Snow. ``This is a company that
has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital
when capital is scarce.''

     Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and
two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported, citing executives close to the companies. Enron's stock
fell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to cancel or
rework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company.

     Investors may inject as much as $2 billion under arrangements
that would protect them from further declines in Enron's stock,
the Times said. The new investments would be in Enron's
Transwestern Pipeline, which connects natural-gas fields in Texas
to the California market, the newspaper said.

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms
that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a
transaction to be completed Monday, officials told the newspaper.

     Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids, pooling their
money and distributing the risk. The firms also like to invest in
industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do
so in partnership with corporate investors, like Dynegy, said
Snow.

     ``You need to know enough about the (energy) business to know
whether it's a good deal, and then you need to be confident in the
Dynegy team,'' he said.

                                KKR

     KKR, the second-biggest private equity firm with $24 billion
in assets, declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly
Morse of Kekst & Co.

     The New York-based firm invested more than $1.3 billion in
DPL Inc., a utility in Dayton, Ohio, and will receive $550 million
of that back from the company after DPL sold $700 million of bonds
in August.

     ``KKR very much gets involved in deals where there's a
corporate partner and they don't have a majority stake,'' Snow
said. ``They would possibly hold it for years, because they like
slow exits.'' KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently
raised a new $5 billion buyout fund.

     Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its
money back on an Enron investment, said Snow.

     ``The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit,'' he
said. ``If there's a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out (the LBO
firms') stake over time, that would give some confidence. But if
the only exit is the public market, that's a little bit dicier.''

     Any private investment also must be large enough to make a
meaningful difference: Enron's market value is $3.7 billion and
Dynegy has proposed paying $23 billion in stock and assumption of
debt. That means the private equity portion would have to approach
$1 billion or more.

     The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than
$5 billion under management each, according to Asset Alternatives,
a Wellesley, Massachusetts industry research firm. Still, many of
those firms don't have enough free capital to undertake an
investment of $500 million or more.

     An announcement of an investment may come soon, analysts say.
Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. are
doing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company
won't be able to finance its business. Enron shares have fallen by
almost half in the past three sessions.

     ``They're going to need this investment within 30 to 45
days,'' said Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``They're
spiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the
$1.5 billion contributed by'' ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy.

                            Other LBOs

     Here's a rundown of the other most likely private equity
partners for Enron:

     --The Carlyle Group could invest through a $1 billion energy
fund it's raising, as well as its general U.S. buyout fund, said
Snow. Carlyle's vice president for corporate communications, Chris
Ullman, declined to comment.

     --Blackstone, which has a history of investing alongside
other corporate partners, recently closed on a $4 billion buyout
fund. Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment on
whether Enron had approached the firm.

     --Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which is based in Texas like
Dynegy and Enron. Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd., an energy
exploration company, among its best investments. The firm recently
raised about $1.5 billion for new investments, about one-third of
what it had hoped to raise, and has said it will focus on ``back-
to-basics'' investments in food, manufacturing and media. Mark
Semer, a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst,
declined comment on Enron.

     Spokesmen for two other firms, Warburg Pincus & Co. and
Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm, didn't return
calls seeking comment.

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit
2001-11-23 11:59 (New York)

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit

     Redmond, Washington Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.'s
plans to expand its MSN high-speed Internet service have been
delayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp., which could cost the
company customers during the holiday season, analysts said.

     MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone
lines available, with help from energy trader Enron, in 45 markets
starting Oct. 25. Instead, the service is now on sale in about 30
markets, said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry.

     The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that
has delayed the rollout of Microsoft's fast Internet access
service over the last year. The holidays are typically a popular
time for customers to buy so-called broadband access, often along
with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts.

     ``They have a track record of picking broadband partners that
don't quite work out,'' said Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at market
researcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc. ``It definitely hurts them
with customers who want broadband right now.''

     Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to
grow fourfold by 2006, according to estimates by Jupiter Media
Metrix, while sales of slower Internet access plans decline. Fast
Internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line, or
DSL, technology.

                         On Track

     Gurry said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is still on
track to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90
percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSL
available in their neighborhoods.

     ``There is very little growth left in the dial-up access
space for Microsoft or anybody, which leaves them with broadband
as the only potential growth area for the MSN access business,''
said Youssef Squali, an analyst at FAC/Equities, who rates
Microsoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc. a ``buy.''

     Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music
and video and software updates, which require fast Internet access
for smooth downloads.

     The company originally began a service with NorthPoint
Communications Group Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of fast Web
access. Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among
cable companies who use their networks for high-speed service.

     Now Houston-based Enron, which agreed in June to provide the
backbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN's service, is suing.
Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver
broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing
and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to
build.

     Enron, which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., recently
disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings
for four years.

                        Slower Expansion

     MSN has been selling high-speed access in 14 states under
partnership with Qwest Communications International Inc. for the
last few months. MSN has begun the planned service expansion
outside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN
Marketing Director Bob Visse declined to name. The company is also
talking to Enron, he said. Enron didn't return calls for comment.

     Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than
expected, Visse said. Since Oct. 25, MSN has added service in Los
Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, California, and
Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, giving Microsoft a
total of about 30 markets rather than 45. Plans to expand
marketing are also on hold, Visse said.

     ``It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are
in,'' said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.

     Top U.S. Internet service provider America Online, owned by
AOL Time Warner Inc., has also been slow to get into the high-
speed market, analysts said.

     That doesn't mean Microsoft is in the clear. Laszlo said both
MSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher
competition from third-place EarthLink Inc. and from cable and
telephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed
Internet access.

     America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN's
7 million. EarthLink Inc. has 4.77 million subscribers. Laszlo
doesn't think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in
the high-speed market that America Online has in the slower dial-
up access market.

                       `Not a Permanent Blow'

     Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft. MSN will be able
to expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays,
Laszlo said.

     ``They are already late in the broadband market so this means
they get a little later,'' he said. ``But broadband will continue
to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a
permanent blow.''

     Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable
partner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over
cable lines. Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking
for fast Web service. The five largest cable providers control 51
percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. The five largest
sellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for
about 33 percent, according to market researcher ARS Inc.

     Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the
company may be interested in an investment in AT&T Corp.'s cable-
television unit, which AT&T is considering selling. Ballmer
declined to comment on Microsoft's plans.

"New Item","
I know you get this daily log stuff all of the time, and probably ignore it, but wanted you to check out the new  - more summarized reporting that we are instituting at the 8:30 meeting.  I think Rick Buy liked it this week, and hopefully this will lead us to more conclusions/trends than just reporting incidents that appear random.

A small step, but one in the right direction...

"EIM Accomplishments","As I look back on the ten months that I have been the Business Controller for EIM and challenged to build the mid and back office infrastructure, the most significant accomplishments are:

Systems - Tactical systems have been implemented to bridge the business while strategic systems are developed.  
	Financial and physical confirmations (with the exception of Lumber) have been predominantly automated.  	
	Financial settlements has been automated.  	
	Implemented modified versions of LISA to handle physical movements and settlements.  Bridges have been built to SAP and Credit Aggregation systems.

People - Ten months ago, the mid and back office had three employees, with the remaining efforts supported by Global Markets.  Today, we have an enthusiastic, energetic team of 41 employees.  The team includes our London office also.  We continue to recruit for additional positions.

Processes and Controls - Many processes and controls have been developed to ensure accurate and timely reporting of P&L and positions, confirmations and settlements.  Some of these tools include:
Pulp and Paper Deal Ticket (Access Database) - Ten months ago, deal tickets were generated through an Excel template and no master copy or controls were in place.  Today, traders, Risk, Confirms, Settlements, Credit, Logistics, etc. can view the deal tickets in a controlled and timely manner.
LISA/TAGG Reconciliation (Access Database) - When the onset of physical business and the implementation of LISA systems, physical transactions for all commodities (except lumber) are entered into 2 systems - LISA and TAGG.  This tool provides a reconciliation tool that allows the Risk system and the logistics/settlements systems to stay in sync.
Trader Training Tools - Two different presentations have been developed and presented to the EIM trading community to help the traders (mostly new to Enron) understand the roles and responsibilities of traders, segregation of duties and the processes within Commercial Support functions such as Credit, Tax, Legal, Operations, Logistics, etc.


Sally, I hope this will give the flavor of the focused efforts.  Additionally, as I have had a few hours to reflect on our conversation, I would like to follow-up with an additional meeting.  I need just a bit more clarity around the EIM role, but more so, I want to move forward to discuss the new role and in your view, how I can still accomplish the successes that coincide with my personal goals.

If you have time tomorrow afternonn, I would really appreciate 30 minutes.

Thanks for your support.  It means alot to me.

Brenda

concern just going to the Closing Date concern you raised (which we will 
try to address, perhaps by requiring ""X"" days notice of a scheduled

Subject:  Revised Settlement Documents 

While we are sure clean-up is needed (such as converting the defined term 
""Mutual Release"" to a new defined term (""MCTJ Settlement Agreement"") 
throughout the documents and, we suggest, defining Dynegy Inc. and Dynegy 
Holdings as ""Dynegy"" for simplification purposes), the attached are 
designed to address your major concerns, including that CGNN not be a party 
in the Adversary Proceeding, with protections designed to prevent Dynegy 
from using that change to attempt to preclude Enron from suing for damages 
for wrongful exercise under the Option Agreement -- which we understand to 
be part of the agreement reached last week.  We look forward to your 
comments.  Merry Christmas.

Subject:	VAR & CAS Positions January 07, 2002

Here is the list for Friday's positions.  To give you an update on what the daily calcs are used for, information from RisktRAC and CAS is being pulled on an ad hoc basis to fulfill requests from both external and internal personnel/companies.  As such, books with any positions should be calced as often as possible.   

Also for the 31st, my understanding after talking to several groups is that certain groups have only limited resources right now and will not be able to provide accurate calcs for the 31st before late this week or early next week.  Please keep me up to date on the status of your information.  Once all books have been calced, officialized, and exported (to Athena) for the 31st we will rerun VAR and produce a DPR.  

Open questions:
Cindy - lets discuss what should be done for ECTRIC on an ongoing basis as well as for the 31st.
Kori - do any of the books listed with you as the BA have positions - if not we can inactivate them
Jeff - there are a couple of gas books that seem to have positions, NG-PR-OPT-PRC (which is inactive) and NG-PRICE-GDL.  Who can I get the status from for these?

Thanks

Shona
X39123

 << File: jan 7 unofficialized.xls >> 

PS:  When you review the information regarding CAS - no position means no 3rd party position.  Since not all groups have deleted their intercompany positions, there may be books listed below as ""no position"" which do have VAR/P&L risk.

"RE: Data needed for Fallon and Delaney","Is everyone responding to you on this?  If not, who are you missing?  I talked to Hall, Perlman and Rub this morning and I assume Sweeney is easy since all his operations people are EIM and EGM.  Also, Apollo and Dayao are probably EES but confirm with them.  Get hem all to respond back to you directly.  

This is also going to be very fluid.  For example, Hall has 43 names or so and we all know that probably and additional 60 or so will get put back to the estate off the UBS list if they go with their plan to take less not more.  Although all of Hall's folks are ENA, the actual names may change.  Also, Jenny Rub has about 100 employees remaining in infrastructure.  This would be desktop support, phones, the network, data centers, etc. and although some techs are dedicated to certain business units, the majority of her group will just support EWS/estate as a whole as they always have.  Her infrastructure group will therefore be shown to you as an org chart with what certain functions groups of people support.  Perlman is attempting to break out but she normally divides by commodity or application, like Unify which cuts across commodities.

Do the best you can.

Thanks.

Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.   They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e. EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA). 
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice. 
Thanks for your help.

"FW: APPROVED Talking Points  - Estate employees","FYI below

By the end of tomorrow, all remaining employees in wholesale will be told which list they are on, NetCo or Estate, and be given info and talking points.

Here is the estate ones.  I will forward the NetCo ones later.

Since the NetCo people's names could and probably will be exposed to bidders in the date rooms, they all need to decide quickly if they want to stay on that list or not.  Eventually, like end of December or very, very early January, if they have not pulled their name off the NetCo list, they will have to accept an offer from the winning bidder or quit because they won't have an opportunity back to the estate.

This is all uncomfortable and information on what it will be like in NetCo or the estate is at a minimum, but I think we all decided honesty was best.

Michelle and Greg's comments included - we  have approval to use the following talking points - Regards, Rj. 

Talking Points - ESTATE Employees 

?	As communicated in the December 19 OOTC email, NETCO is what we are calling the company that will be used to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership
?	You have been identified as an employee who will stay with the Enron estate.  You will not be transitioned to NETCO, once it is formed. 
?	In your role, you will be asked to perform in the interest of the estate as we continue to operate our businesses, or, if appropriate, to sell, wind down and/or close out business activities.  These activities will continue according to the instructions and control of the bankruptcy process
?	As you may know, the bankrupt estate is planning to propose a retention program and severance opportunities for employees who are critical to managing the estate.  A draft proposal has been submitted to the creditors committee for comments, and further details will be released as soon as we can provide them, which we hope will be in the coming days /weeks.  This plan will be separate from the NETCO proposals.  It is our intent to get details of this plan to you as quickly as possible
?	This may create some uncertainty for you.  However, the work you do is important to the value imbedded in the estate and its many affiliate interests. We want you to continue doing your job in operating assets or working on the wind-down as the bankruptcy reorganization process runs its course 
?	As certain wholesale functions and/or business purposes are eliminated, your employment may be terminated.  As I mentioned earlier, we have given a proposed severance policy to the creditors committee.  If that committee approves a proposal, the court then must approve it. There is typically recognition of the estate employees' commitments to the orderly reorganization and emergence of the bankrupt estate, however, there are no assurances available at this time 
?	Be assured that we will advise you of developments as soon as they can be communicated accurately.  If you have any questions or concerns about your assignment, or your role relative to the NETCO deal closure, please address those immediately with your department head or HR representatives

attached please find two agreements - a draft of a mutual services agmt and an employment agmt.  These are drafts to stimulate discussion and comments.  They need to be cleaned up and tightened and in some cases filled in entirely.  There may well be significant changes in approach so do not become too caught up in the minor matters

Let me and Colleen know your thgts....

Have a great Christmas

"DRAFT of 11/30/01 balances","
Here is the spreadsheet as it stands now (draft version, infact I'm still working to ensure all the formulas are working correctly).  FYI - The final version will only show the total balances column & the P&L columns as some groups netted these items and others did not.  Please review your items making sure they:

- tie to the GL
- include all commodities within wholesale
- are consistent from commodity to commodity
- if you have any questions about something in your balance sheet that you believe should be on this schedule please call me to discuss.

Also, I'm still missing ENA, EGM weather & global risk markets, and ECTRIC stuff.  Lastly, there are several reconciling items for ENA net assets I need to talk to someone about to determine whether they should be included or excluded from this schedule (Elaine, would you have time tomorrow am?).

Thanks for all your hard work.

Subject:	urgent info needed for DIP

By 3pm today, could you please provide me with information to complete the attached schedule regarding AR, AP, and shipped but not billed amounts.  This information is needed to be presented to the DIP committee tomorrow.  The purpose of this schedule is to put together a beginning net asset balance sheet prior to bankruptcy.

Specifically, I believe the following people are the point people for:

ENA: Leslie Reeves: AR, AP, Shipped but not billed

EEL, gas, power: David Oliver: prm net asset, liabilities, AR, AP, shipped but not billed, P&L
EEL metals NY/US companies: Louis Colarusso, Claire Wright prm net asset, liabilities, AR, AP, shipped but not billed, P&L
EGM ECTRIC: Cindy Horn/Melissa Allen: prm net asset, liabilities, AR, AP, shipped but not billed, P&L
NORDIC ECTRIC: Matthew Landy: prm net asset, liabilities, AR, AP, shipped but not billed, P&L

Also, please give me information about any numbers you are not comfortable with as I am compiling a detailed schedule of the exceptions/problems with these numbers.

Please call me with any questions, comments, concerns (713 853 9123).

"Razorfish Contracts","Steve, Leslie & Thresa,

We really need to get conversations started on the objectives we / you have for utilizing VMS going forward.  I know up to this point we have been holding off waiting for the results of the East Market studies being done by Accenture. 

VMS is currently in production at a level which configuration efforts can begin for the East Markets.

User Driven / Technology assistance not required:
?	User Training for project team
?	User / Customer Security Setup
?	Counter Party Profile Setup
?	Settlement Entity Profile Setup
?	Event Setup
?	Task Setup
?	Component Setup (Dependant on Interface Information available for East markets see below)
?	Equation Setup (Dependant on Interface Information available for East markets see below)

System development which will need to occur specific to East: (Resource constraint) 

User Driven / Technology assistance required:
?	PMI Interface Requirement / Development
?	Meter Interface Requirement / Development
?	Schedule Interface Requirement / Development
?	Special Screens / Reports not already available within VMS

System Implementation which will need to occur: (Resource constraint) 

User Driven / Technology assistance required:
?	Final Testing and Implementation of Calculation Engine Optimization
?	Testing and Implementation of Exception Handling, Disputing & Allocation
?	Testing and Implementation of Deal-upload to EnPower

In addition, we also need to make some decision rather quickly on the Razorfish Relationship with Enron for the remainder of the year.  The current SOW (Statement of Work) expires at the end of this month.  If we are going to keep them involved, we need to make sure that we have something in place prior to this one expiring.

Can we please schedule a conference call for tomorrow (6/8/2001) to discuss these items?  If tomorrow is not possible, please provide me with your preferred date and time.  I would really like to get this going prior to Wednesday next week.  We are rapidly approaching critical milestones for moving forward. 

Please let me know your availability.

Thanks - MO

Two costs that have not been included are Barbara Gray's time to draft the license agreement and my time to negotiate with AEP.  Please let me know if you need additional information or if there is a formalized process that should be followed here.  Thanks!

It looks like we are close to nailing down the license agreement for POPS with AEP.  There are no major issues with the license agreement.  They want us commit to assigning a resource for about two man months of work to help them bring up the application.  We would bill them $150/hour for this service in addition to the $1,750,000 for the license and source code.  If we can work out a schedule for half days at Enron and the other half at HPL then I think we have a deal.  -  Tommy

"FW: CIBC Data Review Session Thursday, November 1, 11 am","Sally - We are currently scheduled to meet with the bank as listed below.  I understand from conversations with Bob that you are going to name a business point person for Tim Proffitt to use going forward. We should be the ones answering the business questions in tomorrow's meeting but it would probably be helpful for the new person to attend the meeting to become familiar with the project requirements/processes and meet the bank contacts.  These are the same individuals we worked with when gas receivables were monetized. 

To update you on the required information for tomorrow's noon deadline; I have been in contact with gas, power, financial, EGM and EIM through out the day to ensure that all is ready to go.  I met with Tim and Chris this afternoon and received a new format for viewing current month data that I have given to all groups and will pass along to the new point person when they are ready.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Leslie, Melissa, and Scott:

Callum Sutherland and a few others from CIBC will be at the Enron Building tomorrow, November 1, at 11 am to begin the due diligence process for Project Spinach.  Although the overall schedule is tentative, the sessions will begin with a review of October 2001 and November 2001 physical power.  It is anticipated that the review process may last through the early evening.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you will not be available from 11 am until 6 pm tomorrow.

It may be beneficial to have an internal meeting before the CIBC meeting.  When we receive your data and have looked at it, we will give you a call to decide the best game plan.

It is anticipated that CIBC will want to analyze the data and cover among other topics: 
Receivables creation
Invoicing and collection cycles
Price discovery
Netting
Indicative terms of the standard contract
Payment terms
Discounts
Description of the receivables
Number of customers
Diversity of obligor types (e.g., industrial, municipal, military)
Receivables average size
Top obligors
Key contracts
Amounts outstanding (e.g., average, maximum, minimum)
Correlation to commodity prices
Invoicing and collection policies, processes, and procedures
Auditing - internal and external
Account monitoring and management
Reporting capabilities and frequencies
Portfolio performance
Aging profile
Historical losses
Roll forward evolution
Dilution rates and elements
Default rates and elements
Trends in data (e.g., seasonality, intra-month flux)

As always, please call Tim Proffitt at extension 37819, Marcus Edmonds at extension 34243, or me at extension 33139 if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions.   

We will be providing lunch; let us know if you have any special needs.

Please see the attached file for your respective area (by your last name) and make sure you're comfortable with your latest forecast numbers (excluding salaries).  I have added a Capex section for any groups that will plan on spending capital dollars.  Please be as detailed as possible.  

Assume forecast dollars are only reflective of the estate.  For those ENW groups likely to have resources moving to NETCo, please include those forecast dollars in the ""NETCo"" tab.  E.g., If we need a total picture of Jenny's spend, we'll add the ""Rub"" tab (estate) with the ""NETCo"" tab Jenny submits.  

Jenny/Beth P.,
A license / maintenance renewal schedule was obtained from GSS.  We put together a summary tab called ""Lic-Main Breakout"".  These dollars are reflected in your respective forecasts.  Please review for completeness and ensure we are not double counting any dollars already included by your folks.

Please confirm your respective numbers and reflect any changes you know of by end of day today.  

Thanks,
Mike

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"Transfer of EES Risk Control Employees","Kerry,

As you are probably aware, the EES Risk Control organization is moving under Sally as of April 30, 2001.  Our initial thought was we would keep all the former EES employees together in a new ENA accounting entity, but have now decided that the Risk Control group needs to be captured as part of Enron NetWorks.  These were previously set up under a new ENA company number (#1596).  I don't know if within SAP we can simply repoint the profit and cost centers set up below to roll-up under ENW now instead of ENA, if not, we will need five new ones set up as follows:

	Executive (Meredith Eggleston)-27101 [Simper, Keith]  ,150260
	Risk Analytics (Neil Hong)-27102 [Simper, Keith]  ,150261 
	Strategic Operations, Process & Systems (Scott Mills)-27103 [Simper, Keith]  150262 
	Deal Capture/Confirmation (Meredith Eggleston)-27104 [Simper, Keith]  ,150263

I have now updated the file with December 31 actual headcount numbers for 1998 through 2000 and plan for 2001.  I have also updated the EGM numbers and inserted a summary tab.

I have twice emailed Sally Beck, the signatory on the last agreements signed by ENA, with NNG and TW, to see if she could give me a lead on whom to contact.  I also left her a voice mail.  She has not responded.   We cannot proceed with the Northern Border implementation without a confidentiality agreement between ENA and NBP.  

Caminus is still looking to set up a meeting for gathering requirements for both NBP and possibly the Risk Analytics package.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Goodwill Exposure Draft","The Board decided in today's meeting to delay the effective date for adoption of the goodwill and intangible asset portion of the business combinations exposure draft to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, permitting early adoption for fiscal years beginning after March 31, 2001 if financial statements for the first quarter have not yet been reported.  This means that goodwill amortization will continue through year-end.  Discussion is continuing on when the first impairment analysis will be required given the new adoption date and whether or not initial impairments may be reported as a change in accounting principle.

Adoption of the business combinations portion of the exposure draft is still anticipated to be required for acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001.  The main implication of this is that more excess purchase price is expected to be allocated to identifiable intangible assets rather than goodwill for acquisitions completed after this date.

The pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations is still anticipated to be eliminated as of June 30, 2001.

Yesterday evening AEP sent some last minute changes to the license agreement primarily dealing with arbitration.

I'd like to get signatures on Friday so that we can move forward with getting our first payment and then start the process of delivering the application.  

On a related note there have been some issues between AEP and Enron on the commercial side of the business.  Louise Kitchen and Eric Vanderwalde are involved in working through those issues.  Brian Redmond has asked that we call him before executing this agreement.

"Headcount for 1998 - 2001","Sally,
The attached file shows the detail of plan headcount for December 31, 1998 through 2001.  The only number that I still have a question about, is for EGM December 2001, the number I have in the file only represents the people moving into Networks from EGM (Brent's group).  I left a message with Tom Myers, to get the correct number.  
I have also added the graphs that we discussed, which show increase in headcount along with increase in deal counts.
If you have any questions, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian

"RE: NETCO access to RisktRAC","	All,

	Based on conversations with IT, I believe a better solution is to leave the estate version of RMS as is. Since the Netco version of RisktRAC is on schedule for delivery,  I see no gain in populating the estate database with Netco books. Curves will be brought into the Netco version as part of the static data migration.

	In an effort to help with the Netco setup, IT has prepared an Excel template for populating the data required for book creation. Jeff and Stacey will lead the effort to get these spreadsheets populated with all the information required to set up the new books for Netco. Once the Netco version of RisktRAC is up and running, IT will load these spreadsheets and systematically create the new books at that time. 

	I am attaching the template from IT. Jeff and Stacey's teams will need support and training as to the proper population of each of these fields. Perhaps one of your group could take a few minutes to write some basic rules for data population and forward to the new users?

	I hope this alternative will allow the best use of all of our time as we try to get through the requirements for the next couple of weeks. Please respond with  questions or comments.

	Thanks,
	
	Debbie

Subject:	NETCO access to RisktRAC

Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.  In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).  With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.  I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.  Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).  As such, I recommend the following: 

In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.

How does that sound?

Thanks

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. isn't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could bargain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cross-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agreement disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substantially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cents to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the per-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreement with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as some specific trigger points that could be invoked. 
Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffered a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnerships. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since Oct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earnings. 
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the two sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provisions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy shareholders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement. 
Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material adverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisitions. 
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins. 
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-processing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IBP subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, saying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the accounting issue. 
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operations that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercially reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rather than months."" 
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, prompting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC. 
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agreement disclosures were a surprise. 
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting either side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a substantially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In such a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dynegy and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc. 
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If those liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to have occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In some situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well. 
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that losses arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material event. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses. 
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in Enron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate its terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be difficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's frequent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, there is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dynegy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall have become untrue."" 
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in stock prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of Topeka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utilities. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good faith and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" the deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies the accusations.

Options Report
Volatility Fell Slightly in Light Holiday Trading As Enron Calls, Lilly Puts Attracted Interest
By Cheryl Winokur Munk
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
B8
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to recover from too much turkey and football. 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge investor sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading session the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor optimism. 
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for several weeks following the attacks. 
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. ""Typically, going into the Thanksgiving and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets outside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels,"" Mr. Toikka wrote in a recent research note. 
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the technology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Nasdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74.

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in October, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at more than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chairman David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drilling for more oil and gas. 
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, while ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operations, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's earnings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says analyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping oil at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Chevron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene Nowak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and other ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment. 
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stake for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled three of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake has been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says. 
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, ChevronTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Reilly to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a natural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

ALL EYES ON THE ENRON PRIZE If the deal holds, Dynegy will walk away with some juicy assets
By Stephanie Anderson Forest, with Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and Peter Coy and Emily Thornton in New York

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its finances, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher crosstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garnering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business. 
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, CEO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and the company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic answer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of coffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy announced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 billion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key to the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dynegy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp. 
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $100 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's been incredible to watch.'' 
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $200 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now. 
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has worked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, believing it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and paper. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It would have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to match Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commercial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to get rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, including the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in India. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will have the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estimated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. 
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operation earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We looked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it was.'' 
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs ticking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial partnerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the necessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everything of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive earnings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of course, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for its intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are more conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to issue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It should help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parachute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a management job with the new company. 
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online trading and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclipsed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit. ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Trident NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year--he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his bold takeover of Enron, Watson has ensured that he's off the sidelines for good.

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do--and what investors need to know
By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry 
With Mike McNamee in Washington

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After years of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Management pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's net worth. 
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, but it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge off a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those charges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If even the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company actually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made the U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporations. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' says Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board. 
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variety of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such version. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcement, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring net income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn? 
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a company's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts, and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone who uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. accounting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing operations. 
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calculated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, comparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certainly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas. 
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, investors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited net-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, would be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standards Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings. 
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, we better all know what we're looking at.'' 
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in earnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to the SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies.) 
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers using GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38. 
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with increased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. These customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pro forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investors are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.'' 
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter ended on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the telecommunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possible pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' including some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still better 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables. Wall Street chose the rosiest one. 
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointing out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a measure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, as companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and investors are free to ignore everything else. 
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Near the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its assets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions into line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year ending in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only $5 billion. 
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion charge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Analysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic--a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investors to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including severance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company of stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairment of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset. 
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the difference between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using GAAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the company put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cents. 
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investors shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked for comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new rules. 
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rules for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press releases. 
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shaping up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aftereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a growing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time charges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterday's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better. 
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a charge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to distort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall into a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructuring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inventory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School professor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma calculations. 
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings history. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real shareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so far this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareholders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings break out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out there for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should investors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999, and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and potential? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these aren't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economics & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanished into write-offs. 
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that excess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnings can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or charges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for most companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' says Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant. 
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poised for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared with a 6% runup for the S&P 500. 
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, information-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could depress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-time events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperformed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors are apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that changes the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that reflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their properties periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its member controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more charges. 
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless there is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, valuing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. ``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Professor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.'' 
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings games, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the dot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FFO is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.'' 
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and restore GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanley, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens says companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their press releases with the SEC. 
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see numbers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no question is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securities &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrelated
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings are
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometimes
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to its
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on internal
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible assets
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because of a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair values.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs and
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cost
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can ever ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron Corp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstated by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without auditors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek included) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Corporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial reporting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global marketplace (page 76). 
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriously wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business model customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Street conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the method of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GAAP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-time expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing operations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The result is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call standards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAAP. How can investors make intelligent decisions? 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agency Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating earnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedowns from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merger and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill, and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should build on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Up Front: AFTERLIVES
FREE AND CLEAR OF ENRON'S WOES

Back in Enron's heyday, one of its rising stars was Rebecca Mark. Nicknamed ``Mark the Shark'' because of her ferocious ambition, she made her name in the early '90s building the energy giant's international operations, including the now-troubled Dabhol power plant in India. Once rumored to be a successor to Enron CEO Ken Lay, she resigned from Enron in August, 2000, after two years of heading Enron's ailing water company spin-off, Azurix. 
These days, as Enron struggles to stay afloat, Mark-Jusbasche (who hyphenated her name with that of her husband of two years) is watching the action from the sidelines. And she'd like to keep it that way. ``I'm very surprised and saddened by [what has happened at Enron], and I wish them all the best,'' she says. Beyond that, Mark-Jusbasche, 47, is not much interested in talking about Enron, which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectacular Wall Street flameout. Mark left Enron with millions of dollars worth of Enron shares, although she says she has sold them since.
Mark-Jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards, both at Yale and Harvard business schools, as well as the school where her 16-year-old twin sons from a previous marriage are sophomores. 
In her spare time, she seeks out opportunities for investing. Currently, Mark-Jusbasche is considering alternative-energy and water-technology companies. A farm girl from Missouri, she has one investment focus that's especially dear to her heart: looking into expanding her cattle ranches. She now owns 15 acres in New Mexico. ``I'm doing things that are fun, interesting, and important to me--family and community,'' she says. Sure beats being anywhere near Enron.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron still optimistic of averting financial meltdown.
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.

11/26/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $500m to $1bn into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown at the energy trading group. 
Dynegy, whose rescue bid for its Houston rival is crucial to Enron's survival, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron's operations and finances.
Dynegy said it remained ""optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed, and in the time-frame we originally announced - six to nine months"". 
Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dynegy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the group's debt while the deal is pending. 
If the pact stays in place, at least $500m is likely to be invested in Enron by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A further $500m is being sought from private equity firms. 
But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeopardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehicles linked to Enron. 
Enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity from new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities. 
Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fell from $9 to $4.74 following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent of the group's debt burden. 
Completion of a $1bn secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigroup, and the postponement of a $690m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficient to prop up the share price. The bonds also fell to levels consistent with a potential bankruptcy filing. 
The slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that Dynegy is preparing to renegotiate its all-stock bid, now worth $9.3bn, compared with Enron's market value of $3.5bn. 
But people close to Enron say renegotiation of the deal would not in itself have any impact on the energy group's finances. Latest news, www.ft.com/enron.

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has shown remarkable resilience. 
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, experts say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive of Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokerage firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mistakes they should avoid. 
Here are some excerpts from the interview: 
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you think is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's perceptions about risk have changed? 
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, the risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctuations]. There's risk in real estate, too. 
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Over a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty darned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock an investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal. 
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? That because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afghanistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in the markets? 
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. We were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thing is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this country is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and the strength of our government. 
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've had many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about all these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pretty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't get better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully before the economy goes up. 
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resource and buying power that's definitely available for new investments. 
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past two or so months? 
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver. 
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles of fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: ""This is still the time to invest."" 
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don't want to be in the stock market at all."" And it's just the time that people should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio. 
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the poster child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I'll get back in [the market] when I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it's too late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1billion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by Dynegy.
From Bloomberg News

11/26/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
C-2
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors for an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc. 
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but wouldn't divulge details. ""We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we are talking to,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday. 
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading sessions on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the stock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in the acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will go through as planned. 
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net. 
The firms have declined to comment. 
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources. 
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-million note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was ""encouraged"" by the commitment to extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit facility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase. 
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc. as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge, Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company. 
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron. 
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secure financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the merger alive. 
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investigation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratings cut. 
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

11/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further review of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy the company, the Financial Times reported Monday. 
Dynegy said that it, ""remained optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine months,"" the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will proceed only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from these two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms. 
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price fell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00. 
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share price from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegotiating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market value of $3.5 billion, said the report. 
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unnamed sources told the FT. 
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash infusion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could then downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the report said.

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

India's Aditya Birla Not Eyeing Enron's Stake In Dabhol

11/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Aditya Birla Group on Monday denied local media reports that said it is considering acquiring U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) stake in Dabhol Power Co. 
""I have checked with our directors and can tell you that the Aditya Birla Group has shown no expression of interest in Dabhol,"" said group spokeswoman Pragnya Ram.
The Economic Times and Financial Express reported the group is exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest with Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in Dabhol. 
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power plant located in Maharashtra state. 
Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol. Costing $2.9 billion, the power project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date. 
Aditya Birla Group is a leading Indian conglomerate whose interests include textiles and cement. Its two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen PLC (PWG) to produce more than 1,000 MW of electricity in two Indian states haven't made much progress since their announcement in the mid-1990s.

The Enron scandal
A V Rajwade

11/26/2001
Business Standard
10
Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and had very strong management."" James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm. 
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of management of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclosure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its share value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest reports create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance and general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures would make an excellent case study!) 
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, without much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 billion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, the charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launched an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly involved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked. 
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded. 
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed threshold(s). 
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations including J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suffered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid this and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creative accounting genius. 
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year. 
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough. 
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billion) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warrant. But it turned out to be just that for Enron. 
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile? 
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management aggressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times trading assets was what the ""masters of the universe"" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming that ""we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopolies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world."" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst). 
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that ""Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies"", bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has not led to more sober management of trading risks. 
Surely the role of ""markets"" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, between producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether in the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, greed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left?

India's Mehta Comments on Birla Group Offer to Buy Enron Stake
2001-11-26 03:42 (New York)

     Mumbai, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Jaywantiben Mehta, India's
union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

WHEN GOLFING GREATS BEN CRENSHAW AND JUSTIN LEONARD helped the United States win the Ryder Cup in 1999, the prize included $100,000 for each team member to donate to the college of their choice. Naturally, both Longhorns chose their alma mater, and the UT Golf for Life program was born. UT students are seeing the benefits of this collaboration with PGA of America -- one of 14 university partnerships nationwide -- including increased access to driving ranges and putting greens and personalized coaching from PGA-affiliated guest instructors. Hmmm... burnt orange plaid pants, anyone?--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/golf.html
THE LAST DECADE OF THE 20TH CENTURY saw celebrated Texas photographer George O. Jackson traversing Mexico to capture a visual record of more than 200 community festivals. The result is the Essence of Mexico Project, including 50,000 color images and Jackson's own copious notes on the important festivals of more than 60 indigenous Mexican cultures. This exhaustive undertaking has spawned five museum exhibitions in nine international venues. Now, thanks to Jackson's generous donation, it resides permanently in the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection, which is part of UT's General Libraries. The project will be archived during the next two years with Jackson's assistance.--> SEE http://www.lib.utexas.edu/about/news/jackson.html

Subject:	Internal Control Scorecard

Wes,

Per Wade's request, attached is the latest EES internal control scorecard. This scorecard represents a compilation of the ""highest risk"" audit issues identified by Andersen and is the tool we use to track progress on resolving these issues. We also share the scorecard with Rick Causey and the EES Internal Control Committee on a regular basis (about every other month).

I will continue to keep Wade informed on the progress of these issues as most of the issues relate to the risk areas transferred to Wholesale. Also, I will copy you on all future scorecards. 

Please let me know if you need to talk about this further.

Thanks,
Misty

Subject:	Today's Meeting on Curve Validation 

Our curve validation process is one of the key items that Arthur Andersen will be reviewing at year end.  AA has looked for us to strengthen this process, and Tom Bauer stated about 6 weeks ago that he would be looking closely at this.  (His focus may now have been diverted, but I would also anticipate that AA's reviews will have a new intensity about them!)  

In preparation for this, I have called a meeting today with the risk leads across all commodities.  I want to hear from them in a protected environment today what they are and are not doing regarding curve validation.  We will review the recent changes recommended regarding curve validation (from the task force lead by Shona Wilson) and discuss specific action steps to insure that we demonstrate an improved curve validation process.  I have a meeting with Shawn Kilcrest and Tom Bauer later this week and, following today's meeting, I hope to give them assurances about progress that has or will be made.  

You are welcome to join us in this meeting.  If you do not attend, please get with your respective risk leads later today or tomorrow so that you are aware of the current status of curve validation in your area and any improvements that may need to be made quickly.  

The meeting will be held as follows:  	3:00 - 3:30 PM 
					ECS  4102 (my office) 

Attendees:	Jeff Gossett
		Stacey White
		Sam Leuschen
		Scott Mills

"Employee retention","Sally, Bob - just a thought about where we currently are and how we help maintain solid leadership for the future. As I looked around the room at your breakfast meeting today it appeared many of the people in important management roles were probably at an age where they would like to stay at Enron, work hard and hopefully be able to take care of immediate family needs (college, etc.) and then retire with a enough to enjoy their elder years. Others were probably at an age where career changes are in their plans so it's the quick hits that will make a difference. Maybe the mix was 50/50. Clearly I'm in the former category. Several people at the meeting commented about the severe impact the current situation has had on their retirement plans and how the time left to make this up is a concern. In my relatively short time here (3 1/4 years) I have made the following observation. Enron has a great Associate and Analyst program and these employees contribute immediately to the company. In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce that provides great flexibility and energy to our efforts. No doubt this has led to the great success over the years. However at the end of the day the business requires a level of maturity and experience that very effectively complements this young and very talented workforce. Helps pull things together and keep the sanity. In many cases this translates to employees in their mid to later years of their work life. During the good times no problem as bonus $'s and other vehicles take care of things. However we are possibly in a situation where those are limited or reduced to some extent for some extended period of time.  

Question: Do we need to do something positive, send a signal, to our middle aged and more senior employees that we understand the importance and value you add to the company and are willing to take a look at our pension/retirement plans. When we come out of this current situation what will the company look like? Will most of the younger crowd leave for the ""quick hits"" elsewhere? How do we maintain and protect our more senior employees. How do we keep them here before they take another job that offers them additional security? Listening to Ken Lay at the employee meeting when asked a question about pension I don't believe he really knew what type of retirement program we have in place. It really is, save all you can in your 401K and then we'll give you this cash balance vehicle to subsidize it. I know the cash balance option is a newer vehicle that many companies are moving to but Enron's is rather weak. Many companies apply a larger percentage than Enron's 5%. Obviously this all has a cost, I know these plans were carefully considered over the years and changing anything at this point is not going to happen. In addtition this probably goes against our culture in many respects and I'm not saying lets make this a job for life. We still need to manage our workforce as we have in the past and deal with employees that do not contribute regardless of age. 

Just wanted to share some honest thoughts and observations. I get concerned when I look at the makeup of our workforce and think about commitment, loyalty and ongoing leadership. I promise this isn't about me although I certainly have my concerns as I know you do also.  

Thanks for listening - Bob

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"RE: U.T. 2001 Fall Lyceum Series","Kristin,  I spoke with Rick Joseph today.  The September 10 Lyceum is to the 3rd Year PPA students.  This is the overall Enron presentation.  He said that most of the ""firms"" presenting at the Lyceums are bringing more than one person to present the different aspects of the company.  He said that in his original correspondence he sent an evaluation form that gives the points of interest to the students.  He also said that many of the ""firms"" presenting use a video about the company.  He said that the students would be interested in knowing where Enron is going and what the long range goals are for the company.  They would also benefit from knowing the skills that are important to those seeking employment with Enron.

I hope this helps.  The September 12 Lyceum is to the 4th year PPA students and Rick Causey has committed to that presentation.

Hi Rick,
I'm in the process of planning the U.T. 2001 Fourth Year PPA Fall Lyceum series scheduled for every Wednesday in the fall.  As you know, this series brings to campus distinguished practitioners who address our 4th Year PPAs (the equivalent of college seniors) on current issues in accounting and current trends in business.  Last year, you delivered a presentation in this Lyceum on ""Global Equity Markets.""
I'd like to invite you back this year to make a presentation on Wednesday, September 12, from 4:00 to 5:15 p.m. (new time) in UTC 2.102A.   This presentation would be in addition to the Enron company presentation scheduled for Monday, September 10 at the same time and place.  Please let me know (1) if the Wednesday date is convenient for you, and (2) the topic you would like to discuss.  Also let me know if I can facilitate your presentation in any way.
Best wishes,

Subject:	RE: POPS cut over to AEP/HPL, CP ID 95005

After meeting with the AEP and Enron management team yesterday a decision was made to close the HPL sale on June 1st.  Verbal approval from the DOJ has been received with the written documentation to follow next week.  The pigging of the A/S line has been completed and no additional major damage has been found.  

Now it's up to us to execute and get this done.  

Ed:  Please get with Romeo and decide on the best time to make the Pipeline change within POP's.  You may want to do this right after sending your latest HPL nom for May today.  Then after the switch we probably need to send another EDI file to make sure everything is OK for HPL.  

This evening we should kick off the replication push of the transport contracts into POPS.  That way AEP/HPL should be ready to start bidweek next week.

Please let me know if anyone has any questions.  -  Tommy

Subject:	POPS cut over to AEP/HPL, CP ID 95005

After a few meetings, several emails and some testing here is the plan for cutting over POPS to recognize AEP/HPL CP ID# 95005 as the owner of the pipeline HPL.  

On the evening of Friday, May  18th: 
Switch the pipeline within POPS to be AEP/HPL or CP ID 95005.
Switch the Pipeline ID within Global Facilities to be 95005 effective with 6-01 -01 gas day. Matt will go into Unify and change the pipeline owner table to recognize CP ID 95005 as the owner effective the 5-19-01 gas day.  This will allow nominations for the rest of the month to go to CP ID 95005 within POPS.
The duns numbers will stay as they are.  CP # 1321 will keep the current duns.  CP# 95005 will keep the dummy duns.

Please keep in mind the following facts related to the cut over:
The Unify conversion to SQL Server is scheduled for the weekend of June 9th.  The AEP Settlements changes will not be moved into production until that time.
Once the cut over is made retroactive noms before that date will have to be kept in sync manually between MOPS and POPS.  EDI for retroactive nominations will not work after the switch.  Nominations going forward for both HPL  and AEP HPL will work fine through EDI.  By going with the  18th date we give Logistics more time to clean up the past days in case something was missed.  
No AEP/HPL transport contracts will replicate into POPS until we switch the Pipe ID within POPS to 95005.  By cutting over on the 18th, HPL will have the whole bidweek to prepare the pipe for June 1st. New transport contract for HPL, CP ID 1321, after that date will need to be brought to my attention as we will need to coordinate getting the contract into POPS.


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  

Thanks!

Tommy

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are approximately 65 NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 3rd floor.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNN	12404	804	
CNBC	12405	805	
MSNBC	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
Bloomberg	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	

Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. We are testing an additional software product to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, message logging and printing. This system is being tested within the environment and will be available in the next few weeks.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Subject:	EES Transfers to EWS

David/Kalen,

Attached is a detail of new cost centers set up (on Company No. 1596 - EES Wholesale- this is an accounting entity set up underneath the ENA legal entity) to capture the employees transferring from EES to EWS, with the applicable employees listed.  I did not know who all in your departments needed the list, so can you please forward as appropriate.  Any questions concerning names on the list should be directed to the lead of each area indicated in bold.  Questions regarding Deal Capture/Confirmation should be directed to Meredith Eggleston.  If you or members of your teams are notified of changes, can you please make sure I am copied for budget purposes.

Mark Evans

Can you provide the list of your employees/contractors that are moving over.  You can just send that list to myself, David Oxley and Kalen Pieper.

Wanda 

I know some of the employees in your current cost center are not transferring, can you provide a detail back to myself, David and Kalen of who is and where they should be.

All

I'm sure I have missed something, but this should cover most everything.  If I have missed anyone, just reply back to David, Kalen and myself as to who they are and what cost center they should be in.  If you have any other questions, I am out of the office this week, but feel free to leave me a voicemail (5-7464) or e-mail me back.

Thanks

Wade

The objective of the audit will be to determine whether procedures and controls exercised over activities are adequate and operating effectively.  

Results of the audit will be discussed with you and other appropriate personnel both during the audit and at the audit closing meeting. 

We will endeavor to conduct this audit in a manner that will minimize interruption of your normal business activities and we look forward to working with you and your personnel. Please call me at x5-4554 if have any questions.

"Birkman Method On-Line Questionnaire","Sally
Considering the commercialization project and the changes you are instituting I suggest when you have the time to complete and submit the Birkman Questionnaire per the instructions.  I am of the opinion that we will see some significant differences and will identify some strenghts to build upon for the next adventure.

Respectfully

Tom Hopwood

1.  Log into the Web Questionnaire Area
        Web Site Address:  http://www.birkman.com/individuals

2.  Click the 'First Time Here' button.

3.  Enter the Company ID and Password provided below and click 'Submit':
        Corporate ID:  EXAD-54T6-000
        Password:  QDBDK-7781-PGGDR

4.  Choose a unique User Name and Password.  This allows you to return
    to this area to complete the questionnaire if you have to stop
    before you have completed the questionnaire, or if you get bumped
    from the Internet by a computer problem.  You can select any name
    and password -- similar to AOL or other on-line services.  It does
    not have to be your real name.

5.  Complete the Personal Information Form (PIF) and click 'Submit'

6.  Type the words 'I accept'.  This verifies that you have given your
    approval for your sponsoring company or any Birkman consultant
    authorized by your company to review your report.

7.  Complete the questionnaire in one session (approximately
    30-45 minutes).  If an interruption is unavoidable, carefully
    follow the on-screen instructions to restart the Questionnaire.
    The program will take you back to the Personal Information Form
    for you to review or edit.  Retype the words 'I accept' and the
    program will take you back to the last uncompleted question.

"RE: Credit Reserve","I still have some concern over the discussions John and Janet are having around the ""protocol"" for dealing with EES origination in the future.  Consumption premium seems right but I don't know if the credit decision can be made until that part is sorted out.  As we discussed it is impossible to even prepare an income statement at this stage.

Subject:	Credit Reserve

There seems to be some confusion around which DPR captures credit reserve and consumption premium reserves and which balance sheet these items fall on.  
My understanding in talking with both Don and Kevin is that since EES is, on a go-forward basis, being granted origination (which would be the residual after all reserves are applied) that all prudency/reserve items will rest on the WhEES DPR.  The EES DPR will be just a single line net origination number.  We do need to capture the activity related to DSM in the EES DPR (including some portion of credit reserve and drift) but until we have the system capability to capture this it may just have to be part of the whole WhEES bucket.  This tracks with the idea that all future exposures (be they be wholesale price movement, tariff movement, credit exposure, etc.) be borne by EWS.  If so, they need the reserves to properly offset any realized activity.

The balance sheet reserves associated with these items already rest in the ledgers that are rolling up underneath EWS now.  Reflecting the positions on the WhEES DPR will make them consistent with how we are capturing them from an accounting perspective.

If anyone disagrees with this treatment, please respond to all the parties above so we can resolve this issue.  If there are no objections I would recommend moving the credit reserve over at the next possible point.

Wade

P.S.  This thinking only reflects how things are currently contemplated, if the mix around what is with EWS vs. EES (i.e., accounts receivable) we may want to rethink the credit reserve portion.

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

Contributions
The contributions from last year that I mentioned at the meeting turned out to be inclusive of Enron Corp., individual and matching funds.

Weather
I had a chance to talk with our folks from the Weather Group.  The information regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended up being a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams not our weather group.

Scholarship
There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives underway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the individual universities employed here.  They take advantage of matching funds and are administered by employees here with some assistance by Community Relations and University Affairs.  If you are interested in organizing an effort like this for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the details.

All -

The first elaboration iteration (E1) was officially completed on Wednesday Oct 17.  A demonstration of the current functionality was presented to Anthony late yesterday afternoon.  We achieved the majority of our goals including:  capturing, saving, and valuing a retail gen swap deal.  This thread through the system touched each of the architectural layers to demonstrate connectivity between them.  

Thanks for all your hard work in completing the iteration!!   We learned a lot, and are now on the way to delivering a quality system.  The second elaboration iteration (E2) starts today.  The primary functional goals of the iteration are:  capture and value the retail bundled swap, provide the capability to edit and save deals, and provide valuation results to the user.  The target completion date is Nov 2.  I'm looking forward to another successful iteration.

Good job everyone!

Regards,
Susan

"19 Month Forecast Review","Please see the attached file for your respective area (by your last name) and make sure you're comfortable with your latest forecast numbers (excluding salaries).  I have added a Capex section for any groups that will plan on spending capital dollars.  Please be as detailed as possible.  

Assume forecast dollars are only reflective of the estate.  For those ENW groups likely to have resources moving to NETCo, please include those forecast dollars in the ""NETCo"" tab.  E.g., If we need a total picture of Jenny's spend, we'll add the ""Rub"" tab (estate) with the ""NETCo"" tab Jenny submits.  

Jenny/Beth P.,
A license / maintenance renewal schedule was obtained from GSS.  We put together a summary tab called ""Lic-Main Breakout"".  These dollars are reflected in your respective forecasts.  Please review for completeness and ensure we are not double counting any dollars already included by your folks.

Please confirm your respective numbers and reflect any changes you know of by end of day today.  

Thanks,
Mike

"priorities for 1/16 and accomplishments for 1/15","1/15 - 
curve val: we have scoped the curve val project and have discussed it with PwC.  I've talked to E&Y in general terms and have a meeting with them on this at 10 today.  We have also had initial discussions with the different risk groups about the holes in the curve construction & upload process and our deliverable for the end of today is a list of where the holes are and a plan to fill those holes.

We spent significant time with E&Y to go over the  make up of the DPR.  

We are working with the different groups on the 12/31 DPR information.  So far, we have only had one request for it.  My gut feeling is that EIM & ENA are complete, but ECTRIC & EGM need a bit more time.  Chris should have a complete status ready for today.

Our systems are fixed (hooray!).  Yesterday we caught up on the Enovate and Bridgeline DPRs as well as spent significant time with IT to get the systems fixed.

Susie is still working on the SEC VAR for 10/31, 11/30, and will start 12/31 as soon as all of the information is available.  She has also started the net assets work.

Lastly, the whole group had CAS training so once we get access to the system we can start pulling info by counterparty.


Today our goals are:

Curve val - finalize memo (getting agreement from PwC, E&Y, and Enron estate), put listing of curve construction plan fwd, start determining what the different buckets of curves are and what tools are available to perform analysis

Field more E&Y DPR qus

Have a complete status report on the 12/31 DPR.

Prepare ongoing reporting (Enovate, Bridgeline etc).

I also hope to get some time to familarize myself with the CAS environment.

Regards

Do you know where we stand with the Enron America's changes? I presume the Operations people are working with the business people and will then get with the IT people once decision have been made ?
 
Are we done with EES, I heard that Fallon is going to speak to Whalley about their position (i.e. no changes).
 
Are there more questions to ask the EGM/EIM busineses, are these being asked ?
 
Can you send me the spreadsheet we put together.

"FW: New product approvals","FYI - the issue of whether Europe are able to aggregate their positions, calculate VaR appropriately and report to Houston is aquiring heat since they committed to do it by May 10th and its now May 9th.
I understand the natural defensive reaction (I've been there myself) but I don't think citing policy gaps for not having it done is helpful at this stage.

Subject:	RE: New product approvals

There is an established policy and process for approving new products when the word ""product"" refers to a new market (e.g. credit trading) - you can get permanent limits or temporary limits as required.

When the word ""product"" refers to another basis location in a power portfolio, for example, we assume (and the Board does also) that the original authority to trade will cover this too. Hence ""Continental Power"" means ""continental power"". 

We also assume that the same operational guidelines in the policy concerning DPR content, format, reporting, aggregation, apply equally to the new basis location as to the existing ones, and that you as controllers will design your own processes (e.g. the CACS form) to ensure that you can comply.

I am not in favour of having detailed operational procedures in a Board approved risk policy.

Subject:	Re: New product approvals

RAC control the corporate risk policy (please correct me if I am wrong here) so by definition RAC need to be concerned by the operational issues around new products as they relate to ensuring that the end goal of aggregation in the overall Corporate VAR. That is the issue which will continue to face us as the markets expand and deregulate and more and more basis locations get added (the problem we have right now). 

All the investment banks have a new product / new business policy to stop just those issues we are facing and I strongly feel that we should more to adopt the same here. This would help to reduce the noise we are having around the process and close one more door.

Subject:	New product approvals

James,

Further to your comments yesterday on the absence of a policy for New Product approvals, as far as I am aware there is no explicit policy by RAC for approval of new products, other than the extent to which a new product is covered under this paragraph in the Risk Policy manual:-

VI / A.	Subject to the authorization of the Board of Directors, the Enron Corp. Chairman, the President of Enron Corp. and the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer, additional Portfolios may be created and additional Commodity Groups may be added within existing Portfolios, and the related limits will be created or revised accordingly. The President of Enron Corp. and the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer can authorize additional Positions within the existing Commodity Groups, provided that such Positions can be aggregated within the limits of a currently authorized Commodity Group. 

RAC's concern is not with the operational issues around new products, but about whether or not those products are aggregated in the overall Corporate Risk reporting.  I suggest we approach this from our respective ends:  I will raise this with Ted Murphy and Cassandra Schulz to see what level of policy they deem appropriate from a corporate perspective.   From your side, are you able to put together some operational guidelines, if none already exist?

regards

Lloyd

"EBS Potential Staff","Sally,

Still waiting on Marla to finalise what I can 'say' to the out-going staff  - re: deployment, severance etc....

But given that, the following would be available (they don't know yet) and I would recommend highly. There's a total of about another 17 - but these are the top performers.

Molly LaFuze/Amy Heffernan - both Deal Capture, both Sen Spec.

Gary Stadler - Risk - Manager

Andy Blanchard - Manager - would be useful somewhere in Networks - he's a User/Project Manager rather than a developer (FYI - Andy is the partner of Oxley's Elspeth)

The rest - all good - but not stars. We also have several Settlements folks - Schwarz is still finalizing exactly the names.

I'd intend to keep Schwarz, Melissa W, Miralles, Danny C, Denae as 'work-out/planning' heads - a total of about 17. Still a whole bunch of work to do/clear up.

Grim stuff.

"RE: RiskTrac issues as @ COB 1/5/01","Thanks for the update - it looks as though we are left with the relatively easy stuff.

But I wonder whether these points are truly incremental ? For example, does your current Excel model account for half hourly granularity ? Analysis of exceptions, changes is very easy with some of the ""component VaR"" tools in RisktRAC and I am sure you will find this useful. I would also expect user training to be easier than ""somebody else's excel model"" - I even use RisktRAC myself !

Of course there are some significant upsides to all this for the firm as a whole, not least of which is the ability to truly aggregate risk ""capital"" with meaningful correlation - Board members, stakeholders and rating agencies are increasingly inquisitive about how we do this.

Thanks for your efforts

Attached are the remaining concerns over moving to RiskTrac for UK Power purposes.

in addition essentially we will be in a position to move to RiskTrac for the UK and Continental Power and Gas and Scandinavian business lines on the 10th of May in line with the project plan. Considerable additional work will be needed for us to have all the controls and confidence we need going forward but this will not stop us being able to 'press the buttons' on this date.

To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.

"FW: Addition to Enron Document - Regulatory Tariff Filing Application","Tommy,

I see we have another issue with the tariff reporting process.

I would hate to see all this work go down the drain.

Can't we trade this application for something else?  I think
the actual expenditures are in my RC.  If they are I would like to 
trade this app for services that AEP will be providing in June.

The app has no benefit to us at all once HPL is out the door.

If need be, I can have a person on my staff run the app for them
and deliver the reports.

Let's talk, 

thanks

hi Bob,
	it's been awhile!!  it looks as though this regulatory app will have to be run from Mike Potter's machine.  this means that once a month (about a week in duration) Irene & Juanita will be visiting the 32nd floor to run the program or have Mike Potter run it until we can figure out a way to handle this.

I do not think it makes sense to pay Enron to develop a piece of software
that depends totally on Enron systems since theywill be going away.  Do we
have specs on the needs?  If so, forward them to me and I will have one of
our programmers take a lok to see what we can do.

hi Don,
     have you had a chance to think about which way we want to tackle this
issue ?  currently, Mike Potter can run the app from his desk top at enron,
or Juanita and Irene could from his station.  i guess that could be our
back up plan going forward until we have time to determine the best way to
handle this.

Subject:  RE: Addition to Enron Document  -  Regulatory Tariff Filing
      Application

Don:  I met with Mike Eiben on the Regulatory Tariff Filing Application.
As you know it was not an application named under the IT Services
agreement.  It seems to be still something of a work in progress but has
some good functionality that it delivers today.  Unfortunately it will
require some rework to make it work after the sale closes.  The VBA Access
application is currently stored locally on the client workstation or PC.
It uses ODBC and the local NT ID to connect to Global and Unify and pull in
data to update it's database.  It currently has no network login process
and doesn't lend itself to a terminal server set up without some work.
Since we have spent money on a contractor to develop the application I'm
hesitant to just give it away and have you load it directly on an AEP PC
without some type of reimbursement for the development costs.  Even then
we'd have to work through the process of updating the data.  This
application would have to come through Enron's firewalls to get updates and
that would probably not be acceptable to Security.  We could redesign the
interfaces to be more of scheduled push from Enron but we'd want to be
reimbursed for this cost.  Even then you'd have to rework the data feeds
for the application after our service agreement terminates to get data from
your applications.  From talking to Mike I understand that up to 3 people
once a month used to pull all of this data together manually in the past to
make these filings.  How would you like to move forward on this?  Do you
want us to come up with options and estimated costs?  I will hold off until
I hear something from you.  -  Tommy

   Mike Eiben advises that there is another system that needs to be added
   into
   the document you are reviewing:

   ""We've called it the ""Regulatory Tariff"" filing.  It is an
   automated way for HPL to report to the Texas Railroad Commission all of
   HPL
   sales customers, (both onsystem & offsystem) what we sold gas to them
   for,
   and the time frame.  This info is pulled from Unify Settlements""

   I don't know if you've already sent it back or not, but if not, can the
   Regulatory Tariff Access db be added.

   Thanks.

"FYI - Article in process","Hi Sally - 

Just wanted to let you know that I have recently begun collaborating with an ebusiness consultant from CGI - a large Canadian systems integrator with an energy practice - on a demand-generation piece that should be published in the trades in a few months.  The slant is on the scaling systems - IT and people - and the reduction in costs brought about by mid and back office systems affected by a sharp increase in online trading in the energy sector.  Eventually, will probably be looking for some quotes and input from you or your ops people.  I'll keep you up to date.

"BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser","
Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.

Tom Gros tells me that he has submitted a bid for CL and that it is most

We have not done anything for a number of reasons, but one is that everyone
at Enron continues to tell us that nothing has happened here and that we
have plenty of time.

I have asked Mike Bridges to look into this for me (he is supposed to be
our commercial contact), but he seems to know little.

Can you find out what is going on ?  I am going to be highly disappointed
if this thing has slipped out from underneath us.

"Additional New Works; 5/2/01 Floor Meeting, 37th Floor","In order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid- and back- office functions, to decrease replication errors, and to increase communication standards; are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems, processes, and terminology of the various departments. Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).

The reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e. credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented. Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems. These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.

The ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight.

I wont be able to look at the Whalley stuff real close until tomorrow morning so you and Kerry and Mark agree it is OK relative to what we gave him October 15th and I will call in tomorrow morning to give my views.

"Enterprise Wide Risk Management","Hello, everyone.  I'm hoping you know of someone who would be a good fit for an interesting opportunity in Market Risk Management in RAC:

We're looking for a director level accountant or risk management operations person who can join the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) group within Market Risk Management to work on the Asset/Liability piece of Enterprise Risk Management project as we team up with Vince Kaminski's Research group on this challenging new initiative.

The ideal candidate would have Enron experience and be a good project manager, accustomed to working in self-directed situations, able to work with and gain the team support of  mid and upper level management in  research, accounting, risk management operations, finance, treasury, RAC, the business units, etc..  They would need to be able to articulate for top support and commercial management any project issues and implementation challenges, and would be working with risk mgmt operations and the business units on the implementation efforts and process design.  Someone able to take full responsibility for this long term project from its infancy through completion, designing a plan of attack, and then leading the implementation effort.  This person might also act as a consultant for SRM's other initiatives that impact accounting.  Ideally, of course, this person would understand risk management (risk books, trading operations, etc.), but someone who understands the different types of risks inherent in our strategic assets and accrual accounting contracts might also be a good fit if they're self-motivated and willing to dig in and learn the risk management business.

I think it's a great opportunity for someone to broaden their resume and gain market risk management expertise.  We've met with top risk management consultants, and this is a cutting edge initiative that will put us head and shoulders above our peers.

If you want to forward this to potential candidates, below are some links to websites that may provide some overview information on asset-liability / EW risk management (I haven't reviewed the sites myself yet).  Also, Vince's outline on Enterprise Risk Management from early last year is attached below.  

Please call me if you know of someone who might be interested.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

"UBS Systems Integration","Hi Sally,

I know it's very early to be contacting you, but I hope that you will
remember KPMG when you get to UBS and need help with systems
integration/data mapping type work.  UBS was one of my clients when I lived
in Switzerland and I was very involved with the implementation of a system
called DACFA 2 which was used for global data pooling and consolidation.  I
have actually re-initiated contact with people I know in UBS Corporate Audit
in Zurich and will be providing them with general information concerning
wholesale energy trading.

We would very much like to speak to you regarding your planned role in Netco
and the direction you think the company will take.  Again, I realize that's
it very early, but I know that you will continue to operate at Enron speed
and if we wait it will be too late to help.....

Attached are the revised settlement documents we sent to BakerBotts on
Christmas Eve.  We, of course, have not yet heard back.  Was Rod Hayslett's
concern just going to the Closing Date concern you raised (which we will
try to address, perhaps by requiring ""X"" days notice of a scheduled
closing)?

Subject:  Revised Settlement Documents

While we are sure clean-up is needed (such as converting the defined term
""Mutual Release"" to a new defined term (""MCTJ Settlement Agreement"")
throughout the documents and, we suggest, defining Dynegy Inc. and Dynegy
Holdings as ""Dynegy"" for simplification purposes), the attached are
designed to address your major concerns, including that CGNN not be a party
in the Adversary Proceeding, with protections designed to prevent Dynegy
from using that change to attempt to preclude Enron from suing for damages
for wrongful exercise under the Option Agreement -- which we understand to
be part of the agreement reached last week.  We look forward to your
comments.  Merry Christmas.

These gentlemen represent a coalition of 13 Houston relatively large minority professional services firms who are looking to bring additional value to Enron and expand their footprint in some of the larger Houston area companies.  According to Cindy, the goal is for Enron to be a pilot in utilizing some of these professional services firms.  My plan is to conduct due diligence on these organzations prior to making formal recommendations to the Management Committee.  

The purpose of this note is to seek your assistance in scheduling some time with you and Robert Carter of The Enterprise Group to identify opportunities to provide support services.  Cindy Olson ask that I set this meeting up with you asap.

	the records group was assisting carolyn gilley and her contractor with this project.  answering questions/retrieving 	boxes/research/etc.  we do not know where her contractor left off with the project, but would be more than happy to 	provide a group to complete the project for AEP.  the enron records department handles information for all enron 	companies.  this would eliminate the learning curve if a new group were brought in.   i had asked mark thorne about 	the status of this project when i learned carolyn and her contractor had left.

This definitley does not sound like HPL.  I will ask around and see if anyone knows anything.  

However, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of conference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are approxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong to AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gilley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and removing the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs for the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team of contractors to complete this.

"Non-Elective IT Support Staffing for EBS -  2002","Following this week's discussions, we have recalculated the absolute minimum number of people required to keep your present systems in production.  In recalculating this number, we have eliminated everything except that which is required for ""non-elective"" maintenance.  Although many of the systems have been in operation for some time, we still frequently encounter problems which interrupt production.  Such events require emergency attention and are what we refer to as ""non-elective"" maintenance.  Therefore, in recalculating these support staff, we have excluded any effort for improvements or other changes that the users have previously identified for next year's work.  Also, we are suggesting excluding any further effort on the Saber Settlement, GeoQual, Market Intelligence, DPC Tax & Media Services systems which we will simply wrap up as those are and put them in ""moth balls"" for possible future use.  As the result of this process, we have come to a core minimum number of 19 people required to simply ensure that the remaining systems continue to function.  The only way that we can logically reduce this core number any further would be to ""turn off"" other production systems.  Although we recognize that the concept of turning-off other production systems is unattractive, it would be far better to have this happen in a planned, orderly fashion than having them crash in an unrecoverable condition later.

Inja Chun

As we discussed at the Lunch meeting yesterday, we have previously reviewed all of the EBS systems to determine the minimum staffing required to keep the system operational (maintenance) and to meet any currently identified modifications (future development).  The summarized numbers are shown on the attached cover sheet by each system with accompanying backup details.  The details cover major functionalities of systems, magnitude of system (i.e. # of deals, # facilities) and other information that Greg Piper asked in the meeting.  Also shown on the last column is an estimate of the impact on our users and customers, if the computer systems were no longer available.   I look forward to discussing these issues with you on Monday, and please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

"Genesys or now the Liberty Project","Mike & Sally,

Below is the information that we received on the project.  I am still waiting on a cost center from EES for the expense portions to settle to.  Look over this information and let me know if you still want to meet to go over this.  

This is the EES project, which is set up on EES to capture the capital portion of the project costs.  The expense portion should settle to an EES cost center.



The project set up shown below is the Networks project, which I set up, but have not yet released.
Only Release 1 is shown below.  There are three releases set up, but only the first one will be released at this time.  All three releases or phases will look like the other phases. 

As you can see below, the capital parts of the project (Solution Definition, Design & Build, and Implementation & Testing) are set up with three basic WBS elements.  These elements as described below will settle to the EES project as follows.

Project Coding on Networks Project					Settles to EES Project WBS
C.300000.01.SD.OU	Rel 1 SD Outside Consultants Labor		C.007730.22.01 Outside Professional
C.300000.01.SD.EN	Rel 1 SD Enron Labor				C.007730.22.03 Enron Labor
C.300000.01.SD.OE	Rel 1 SD Other Expenditures			C.007730.22.05 Other Expenditure

C.300000.01.HW Hardware Purchases					C.007730.24.01 Hardware
C.300000.01.SW Software Purchases				            C.007730.24.02 Software

This will allow the costs on the Networks project to be tracked in a manor that will support how the charges are settling to EES.  So if EES has any questions about the charges we should be able to pull up the detail very quickly.

The following items will settle to an EES cost center since they are expense related.
  C.300000.01.PI.TR	Rel 1 PI Training Dev & Delivery
  C.300000.01.PI.PI	Rel 1 PI Post Implementation Support
  C.300000.01.PI.GA	Rel 1 PI General & Administrative

Jenny,

Whilst undestanding that you do provide shared services - could you maybe give me a little more detail on what areas you support, what offices/locations, relationship with NetCo, Wholesale, Pipelines etc...What was your allocation methodology for the 2001 budget?

My goal here - for Jim - is to understand how many bodies (& related cost) it is going to take to support the Wholesale Post Bankruptcy actvities - as we are doing for all support and commercial functions - so we can complie a fwd cash forecast.

Any education would be appreciated. An org chart would also help.

Thanks.

Barry.

Importance:	High

Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.   They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e. EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA). 
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice. 
Thanks for your help.

"Roles and Responsibilities","Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Delainey

"Canada curve issue","Dear Sally,

Here is where we are on researching the Canada issue.  In a nutshell, certain curves, which had been there in the past/yesterday, did not show up today.  We are still working with Canada to determine why - either an IT problem or Human Error.  We will rerun VAR & positions once we get the curves in.

Regards

Kathy/Brian

In regards to Franks comment below I have a suspicion that the issue may be related to the following curves that are showing up on Winston's VaR error log. Brian, I've copied you as well since they are gas curves.  Below are the error description followed by the actual portfolios that are missing curves.  Have these curves been loaded?


DESCRIPTION
These curves are not in the database. (This means atleast for last 15 calender days 
these curves are not loaded into database.) For example if we get position for 
Curve Code = NGI-SOCAL and risk type code = 'M' and in the database there is no curve 
loaded with the combination of Curve Code = 'NGI-SOCAL' and risk type code = 'M', 
VaR Engine will give this error. The curves need to be loaded from the source 
system. For example GAS curves need to be loaded in ERMS and all other commodities 
are loaded into RMS database

ERRORS
 CAN-B-GD-XL-GDL 	[Portfolio_Id: CAN-B-GD-XL-GDL ] Can't Find Original curve : 23-NOV-01,AECO-CND/IM , risk type =M, curve type code = PR and data source = ERMS

 CAND-PWR-GD-G1 	[Portfolio_Id: CAND-PWR-GD-G1 ] Can't Find Original curve : 23-NOV-01,GD-AECOCD/FRWKD , risk type =M, curve type code = PR and data source = ERMS

 CAND-PWR-GD-G1 	[Portfolio_Id: CAND-PWR-GD-G1 ] Can't Find Original curve : 23-NOV-01,GD-CGPR-AECO/AV , risk type =M, curve type code = PR and data source = ERMS

 CAND-PWR-GD-G1 	[Portfolio_Id: CAND-PWR-GD-G1 ] Can't Find Original curve : 23-NOV-01,GD-CGPR-AECO/DA , risk type =M, curve type code = PR and data source = ERMS

It doesn't look like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)

"New EBS Procedures for Risk Management Books","Good morning-

Discussions have taken place between EBS (Barry Pearce) and RAC (David Port) to make adjustments to the EBS daily risk-reporting process.  This memo will outline the changes that have been discussed and agreed upon.  EBS will implement these changes this week.

DPR 

All risk books will be run on Tuesday and Thursday of each week and P&L will be reported for those days.  

POSITIONS AND CURVES

Pending an IT solution, positions and curves will be loaded each day.  On days when the books are not run, we will use prior day information.  Per discussions with Credit, this process is sufficient for counterparty exposure reporting.

CASH FLOWS

Cash flows will be loaded on days the books are run.  Infinity will pick up prior information on days when books are not run.

_____________________

EBS will agree to run books on days when significant changes occur or we are at month-end.  

Please do not hesitate to call with questions or comments.

Thank you,

Subject: Independent Kiodex analysis of EnronOnline risk?


Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.  Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty

"You asked for questions","Sally-

Yesterday at the floor meeting on the 32nd floor, I asked you a pointed question regarding trust of company management.  I appreciated your effort to confront the frustration that many employees currently have.

However, you also requested other questions.  I have a number of questions, and I have tried to collect a number of questions from those that I have heard around the floor.  In addition, I have a couple of suggestions for what could be done to build badly lacking morale.

I am sorry for the long list, but in reality this is probably just the tip of the iceberg regarding questions and concerns out there.  I hope that you can answer some of these questions, and I hope that you can ask some of these questions to those who might know.

I appreciate your efforts.

Here is the list:


 

I have sent this to my two supervisors as well.

Have a nice day.

"IT Plans for Estate","Greg,

Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the estate's ability to service IT requests.  The number of people that remain in the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we're receiving resignations now).  With this in mind, I would like to have the ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and potentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accenture or CGEY).  We would need to move the estate employees into this company and incentivize them to stay.  The consulting company could then supplement the staff and the Enron estate employees could now have a career path at the consulting company. 

To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and processing services to other companies.  By the way, this could be done for other commodities outside gas and power.  The deal would have to include royalty payments to the estate for each additional services agreement.  The intent is to make the services company into a thriving business.  We would also want to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.  We could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.

All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estate while the businesses wind down or start up.  We must make sure that the NETCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in some capacity and continue to develop the applications.

As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.  There are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we cannot maintain a fully operational production quality system.  These deals must either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the above referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline).

I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.

I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.  I'll also have my Blackberry but reception is poor on the island!

Have a great holiday.

"Article detailing a new competitor in the back office outsourcing space","These guys are new - system is ready for beta testing.  Offering an ASP solution for mid and back offices, including lots of reporting and credit.


May 3, 2001---A new middle and back office Application Service Provider (ASP) solution has been launched by Derigen Consulting. The Derigen Trade Center is designed to provide small and mid-sized trading and marketing operations an entry point into a comprehensive trading system. (5/4/2001) 
The product is said to provide a trading system that automates the workflow of trading operations in a secure, scalable and reliably environment for any energy trading organization. Derigen Trade Center provides trade capture, profit and loss reporting, position reporting, contract tracking and confirmation generation, settlement accounting, physical scheduling, and credit management functions. 
""We know that many of the smaller and mid-sized trading operations are not purchasing trading systems because they either don't want to make large capital investments in software or they don't want to have the IT responsibility of maintaining a mission critical application"" said Robert Jacobs, CEO. ""By providing an ASP solution to our clients, they no longer have to purchase expensive equipment and maintain extra IT staff to support it. All they need is an Internet connection and an up-to-date browser so that they can log into our secure site from anywhere over the Internet."" 
""The Derigen Trade Center is based on mature Oracle and Java technology and capitalizes on the knowledge of Derigen Consulting's experience in creating energy trading systems for the past 20 years,"" said Jeffrey MacInnis, President of Derigen Consulting. ""We've learned how to make reliable and secure systems that reflect our clients needs."" 
Derigen is inviting companies to apply as candidates for the beta phase of the application where clients would get to use The Derigen Trade Center while helping to test for bugs and suggest customizations. The Derigen Trade Center is expected for final release of version 1.0 later this summer. Check the Derigen web site www.derigen.com for information on how to apply for the beta program.

Doing fine - still in the boat.  At what is truly the eleventh hour, I seem to be getting calls about taking the Netco operations role.  Despite my statement of disinterest, there are those who would like to have one more conversation when the purchaser is known and a real role could be discussed. 

I have met with Fallon several times over the last several days, but each meeting has specifically focused on information needs for E&Y relative to the estate or conference calls related to the transition services agreement with Netco.  Jim seems busy with these issues.  

I am meeting with Janet D. tomorrow morning at 8:00 to give her an update on an infrastructure plan.  I have Bob Hall researching the details and status of the Peoples JV, Bridgeline and wholesale and retail power positions in California (he is coordinating with Beth Apollo and team on the retail side).  These details will help us flesh out the right support if these are some of the first assets that will be managed to create a go-forward company.  

I enjoyed the dinner Tuesday night and had the opportunity to visit over dinner with a couple of people that I had not known before.  Seems like a good group.  --Sally

Enron says repayment of 690 mln usd debt extended until mid-Dec

11/21/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said its creditor banks have granted an extension on a 690 mln usd note payable by Nov 27 until mid-December, giving it enough time to restructure the debt. 
In a statement, the troubled energy company said the extension has been agreed following talks with its main creditor banks on restructuring its debt to avoid a liquidity crisis.
""We have been in continuous contact with our banks and believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet and address upcoming maturities,"" said chief financial officer Jeffrey McMahon. 
Enron first informed investors of the possibility it would be forced to repay the 690 mln usd note in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. 
The obligation arose after Standard & Poor's cut the company's long-term debt rating to BBB- last week, forcing it to either post collateral on the note or repay it on maturity. 
Enron said it has also secured the remaining 450 mln usd of a previously announced 1 bln usd credit line from JP Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney. The facility is secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co unit. 
The other 550 mln usd are secured by the assets of its Transwestern Pipeline Co. 
Enron also said it is still committed to its merger with Dynegy Inc, announced on Nov 9. 
""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders,"" said chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay. ""It offers the opportunity to create a formidable player in the merchant energy business with substantial growth prospects and a strong financial position."" 
JP Morgan Chase vice chairman James Lee said the bank will work with Enron and its other creditor banks ""to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy"", which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2002.

USA: Enron secures credit line as shares fall.

11/21/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Wednesday it secured the remaining $450 million of its $1 billion credit line and reaffirmed its commitment to an agreement to be taken over by rival Dynegy Inc. 
Facing a crisis of confidence, Enron said it is in active talks with its other lenders to restructure its debt obligation and had pushed back the deadline for repaying a $690 million loan obligation to mid-December.
""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders,"" Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said in a statement. 
Enron shares were down 28 percent after noon on Wednesday, after being down 33 percent earlier in the day. Its shares fell about 23 percent on Tuesday amid concerns over its liquidity and growing questions over whether the proposed takeover by Dynegy would go ahead.

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of embattled Enron Corp. plunged another 32 percent Wednesday morning as analysts and investors continued to doubt the once-mighty energy trader's ability to recover lost business and investor confidence. 
In a report released Wednesday, Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer became the latest to question Enron's future, saying that an SEC filing by the Houston-based company earlier this week ""raised new issues about liquidity and the ability of the company to even finance itself over the next several months.""
Analysts are also questioning whether Dynegy Inc.'s planned dlrs 8.9 billion acquisition of Enron will survive given the latest revelations. 
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Enron late Monday restated the company's third-quarter earnings and stated that it may have to repay a dlrs 690 million debt by next week because of decreased credit ratings. 
The filing also noted that Enron's financial woes have led to a ""reduced level of transaction activity"" with the company by trading partners. 
Enron shares fell 23 percent Tuesday, then dropped another dlrs 2.25, or 32 percent, to dlrs 4.74 Wednesday in extremely heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Fleischer said Enron's Nov. 16 cash balance of dlrs 1.2 billion is inadequate to meet remaining debt obligations. 
Fleischer acknowledged, however, Enron's efforts to renegotiate next week's due date for the dlrs 690 million debt, which was triggered Nov. 12 when the company's credit rating was downgraded to BBB-, saying that there are indications that Enron's banks may be willing to roll current maturities over and even make new equity investments. 
Michelle Foss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of Houston, said this latest round of troubles had to raise concerns about whether the Dynegy-Enron deal will be pulled off. 
""It doesn't look like it's going to be able to happen,"" Foss said. ""It did look like a decent idea when they proposed the merger, but today I'm sure they'll look at it and see if they can salvage their attempt to buy Enron."" 
Shares of Dynegy were off dlrs 2.55 to dlrs 39.15 in trading on the NYSE.

Tobacco suits by Venezuela, Brazil's Espirito Santo dropped 
MIAMI (AP) - Health care cost-recovery lawsuits against major U.S. cigarette makers by Venezuela and the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo have been dismissed. 
""This is another important reminder to American plaintiffs' lawyers that a state court won't ignore the overwhelming number of decisions by federal courts rejecting these lawsuits,"" William S. Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris Cos. vice president, said Tuesday after the decisions. 
Attorneys for several foreign governments have filed an assortment of lawsuits in U.S. federal and state courts in an attempt to find some legal mechanism that withstands judicial scrutiny. 
Russia and other Brazilian states are among the foreign governments that have sued in Miami, where a verdict of dlrs 145 billion was awarded to Florida smokers against the five biggest U.S. cigarette makers. 
Ecuador's suit in Miami was withdrawn earlier when another state judge announced his intention to dismiss it.

General Motors of Canada inks supplier agreement with Quebec rubber plants 
Eds: Dollar figures are Canadian. 
MONTREAL (AP) - General Motors of Canada has signed supplier agreements with a Quebec auto-parts maker that helped create about 800 jobs, news reports said Wednesday. 
The deal with Saar-Gummi Automotive Group in Magog, Quebec, is part of General Motors' commitment to offset the jobs that will be lost when it shuts down its car assembly factory in Boisbriand, Quebec, next year, killing 1,400 jobs. 
GM did not reveal the value of the contracts, but German-based Saar-Gummi said Tuesday it has made a dlrs 40 million investment in its seven Magog plants, doubling its workforce to 1,600 employees from 800 since last summer. 
The factories make molded rubber parts for cars, such as the rubber strips and molding found along the doors of vehicles. Most of the production is sold to GM, and goes into 56 GM plants in Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
The products will be used in several models including the Chevrolet Avalanche, GMC Envoy, Saturn VUE and Cadillacs.

Enron Closes On $450M Secured Credit Line

11/21/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Co. (ENE) closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines and said it is in active discussions to restructure its debt to improve liquidity. 
In a press release Wednesday, Enron said the $450 million credit facility is secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co.
A $550 million credit facility, secured by the assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co., closed Nov. 16. The proceeds are being used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. 
The company said it was informed by the lead bank on the facility that the maturity on its $690 million note payable obligation will be extended to mid-December. Enron expects the extension to be finalized shortly. 
Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting noncore businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 

Enron's credit lines are from J.P. Morgan, the investment-banking arm of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), and Salomon Smith Barney, the investment-banking arm of Citigroup Inc. (C). 
Enron also reaffirmed its commitment to the merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN). On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002. 
On Monday, Enron filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter, which reflected a wider loss by 3 cents a share. The energy company previously reported a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share, on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares fall further on credit concerns.

11/21/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. shares tumbled 33 percent in early trading on Wednesday, following a 22.8 percent drop on Tuesday, amid concerns over the company's liquidity and growing questions over whether the proposed takeover by Dynegy will go ahead. 
Enron's shares were down $2.29 to $4.70 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the biggest loser by percentage and the most active stock on the NYSE.
""The Dynegy deal will take a long time and a lot of things could happen over that time period. Dynegy did their homework, but if they missed anything, they have a number of exit opportunities,"" said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Michael Barbis. 
Dynegy was not immediately available for comment. 
Wall Street analysts said Enron is losing market share because of credit concerns from its trading partners and questions over Dynegy Inc.'s takeover offer. Enron warned on Monday it could be forced to pay by next week a $690 million debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week. 
""Enron is definitely losing market share on credit concerns. Cash needs to run the buisness have now increased. The market perceives Enron as needing more cash,"" said Barbis. 
On Monday, Enron disclosed it is up against a deadline of Nov. 26 to deliver collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its many partnerships. 
If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
Enron is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. 
On Monday, the Houston-based company also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share.

CNNfn: Market Coverage - Morning
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Time now for upgrades and downgrades. 
Salomon Smith Barney downgrades Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) to neutral from outperform saying the company`s earnings estimates too aggressive in light of the economic conditions.
Goldman Sachs, as we heard from Chris, removing three energy firms; Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) , Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) and Williams (URL: http://www.williamsenergy.com/) , from the recommended list. 
Dynegy was expected to buy the troubled Enron. It is still, but it`s rated market perform now as is Enron. Williams rated market outperform. Goldman says it`s concerned about Enron`s ability to recover from the loss of significant business deals and sees no positive catalysts for the entire group largely due to the problems in Enron. 
On the upside, Deutsche Bank is raising Xerox (URL: http://www.xerox.com/) to buy from market perform saying it`s pleased with the company`s turnaround strategy. We`re going to talk about that in detail when we speak with the analyst who made that call in just a moment. 
First, we want to take a look at how these stocks are trading. Entire group is down with the exception of Xerox. It`s up 15 cents. 
Peter Ausnit is imaging analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown and joins us. 
And thanks for joining us here on MARKET CALL. What is it about Xerox you like? 
PETER AUSNIT, IMAGING ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK ALEX. BROWN: Well I think the company`s really put its liquidity concerns behind it and now investors can look at the long-term picture, which is much brighter. 
CHARLES KADLEC, J&W SELIGMAN: Peter, it`s Chuck Kadlec. Good morning. Is this is a heroic recommendation here? Is this - should we consider this more of a speculative investment or is this something that a conservative investor ought to be interested in? 
AUSNIT: I think investors should be interested in this if, over the next several quarters - in the near-term, the conditions are still quite difficult but over the long-term it`s not that speculative. Xerox has a large install base, a tremendous sales and service force and can probably return to industry standard margins. 
KADLEC: As you say, this probably depends on management`s ability to execute here. Why do you believe this management is going to be able to execute their strategy? 
AUSNIT: Well their track records during the turnaround has been fairly strong and the strategy has made a lot of sense. They`ve sold a lot of businesses. They`ve done most of the things they promised to do such as bring on new third party equipment financing and they`re going to bring on a new CFO as well. 
SCHAFFLER: Peter Ausnit of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, thanks for joining us.

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)
2001-11-21 12:38 (New York)

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)

     (Updates with amount of debt in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares had
dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis, said lenders
extended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million note
due next week.

     Enron, which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction now valued at more than $23 billion,
said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to
repay the $690 million note. The repayment would strain cash
reserves Enron needs to back its trading operations, investors and
analysts said.

     The Houston-based company didn't say in its release who holds
the note, which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns
Brazilian natural-gas assets and was backed by Enron.
     The note is held by a group of banks led by the Citibank unit
of Citigroup Inc., Standard & Poor's said in a press release
yesterday.

      Enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a
restructuring of its debt, the company said in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire.

     ``We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary
lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' James Lee,
vice president of JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in the Enron
statement. ``We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders
to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to
and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Morgan has been advising
Enron on its merger with Dynegy.

     Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before the
merger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before the
end of the third quarter of 2002.

      Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2
billion in cash or credit lines.

     Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell
$1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading. Before the
announcement that it had renegotiated the $690 million note, its
shares had fallen as much as 42.78 percent, the lowest level in
more than a decade.

     Dynegy fell $2.50, or 6 percent, to $39.20. Shares of
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 49
cents to  $87.02



Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)
2001-11-21 11:49 (New York)

Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21, (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp., the
biggest energy trader, and Dynegy Inc. fell for a second day on
concern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegy
can be completed.

     Enron tumbled as much as 33 percent, and Dynegy dropped as
much as 6.7 percent. Enron's bonds also fell. The company's 6.4
percent notes maturing in July 2006 were bid at 62 cents and
offered at 66 cents, traders said. They sold at about 72 cents
yesterday.

     Institutional investors sold shares of both companies after
Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer downgraded them to
``market perform'' from his ``recommend'' list, other analysts
said.

     The Dynegy bid ``did not eliminate customer concerns about
Enron's liquidity and long-term viability,'' Goldman Sachs said
in its report. ``We now believe that it will be difficult for
Enron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that
Enron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide
cash or letters of credit to back routine transactions.''

     Fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for Enron to 50
cents from $1.35. Enron had been expected to make $1.90 next
year, the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron said Monday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the Houston-based energy trader may run
out of cash. The company said in a regulatory filing it has less
than $2 billion in cash or credit lines.

     It also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its
credit rating may force it to repay a $690 million note next
week. Enron said yesterday the terms of the notes, which it
guaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian
natural-gas assets, are being renegotiated and that it had a
``verbal indications'' that the maturity of the notes will be
extended.

     The company's dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federal
investigation and a management shakeup. Dynegy plans to complete
its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules.

     Mirant Corp., Aquila Inc. and other big energy traders are
doing fewer transactions with Enron as concerns increase about
its credit rating and ability to finance daily business,
executives said yesterday.

     Enron's stock fell $2.28, or 32 percent, to $4.71 in
late-morning trading. Earlier, it touched $4.67, its lowest price
in more than a decade. The shares have plummeted 92 percent this
year. Dynegy fell $2.70, or 6.5 percent, to $39.00. The shares
had dropped 26 percent this year.

U.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint

     New York, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list of
companies whose shares are moving in U.S. markets Wednesday, Nov.
21. The stock symbol is in parentheses after the company name.

Major Moving Stocks:

     Enron Corp. (ENE) fell $1.54, or 22 percent, to $5.45 and
traded as low as $5.44. The energy trader shares fell for a second

Other Moving Stocks:

     Cardiac Science Inc. (DFIB) rose 51 cents, or 16 percent, to
$3.65 and traded as high as $3.89. The maker of equipment used to
restore a normal heartbeat to patients in cardiac arrest said the
San Diego City Council approved an agreement for the company to
deploy automated external defibrillators in the region. The
company made the announcement in a press release distributed by PR
Newswire. Officials couldn't immediately be reached to comment.

     Guidant Corp. (GDT) rose $4.18, or 8.9 percent, to $51 and
traded as high as $51.50. The maker of products to treat heart
disease said a study showed implantable defibrillators cut deaths
by 30 percent in heart-attack survivors, potentially expanding the
$1.9 billion market for the product.

     Portal Software Inc. (PRSF) fell 34 cents, or 15 percent, to
$1.89 and traded as low as $1.64. The provider of Internet-billing

     Money flows, the difference between the value of trades made
at a higher price than the previous trade and those made at a
lower price, may also appear for some stocks. These inflows and
outflows show whether people are willing to pay more for a stock
that's rising, or to sell a stock that's falling for less. If not
it's a signal the share price may soon change direction.

Plunge Says End Is Near at Enron

By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>
Senior Columnist
11/21/2001 12:32 PM EST
Enron (ENE <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/StockQuotes.jhtml?tkr=ENE>:NYSE - news <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/BBNews.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - commentary <http://find.thestreet.com/cgi-bin/texis/cmttkrfind/results.html?tkr=ENE&site=tsc> - research <http://thestreet.multexinvestor.com/search.asp?Ticker=ENE> - analysis) <http://www.riskgrades.com/clients/thestreet/index.cgi?tickers=ENE> shares plunged a second straight day Wednesday as fear mounted that the struggling energy trader's bailout merger plan will unravel. 
A potentially lethal cash crunch appears to be gripping Enron, even though its planned acquirer Dynegy (DYN <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/StockQuotes.jhtml?tkr=DYN>:NYSE - news <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/BBNews.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - commentary <http://find.thestreet.com/cgi-bin/texis/cmttkrfind/results.html?tkr=DYN&site=tsc> - research <http://thestreet.multexinvestor.com/search.asp?Ticker=DYN> - analysis) <http://www.riskgrades.com/clients/thestreet/index.cgi?tickers=DYN> has injected $1.5 billion of cash, and banks have opened new credit lines. An Enron collapse would cause weeks of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy traders, and it would cause big losses for the Houston company's creditors. 
Just before noon EST, Enron announced in a press release that it had extended to mid-December a $690 million obligation that was due next week. It also said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion secured credit line that has J.P. Morgan Chase as its lead banker. 
Investors have been fleeing Enron since the company last month disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party hedging transactions. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Enron deals with related parties. The October disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested the company hadn't been forthcoming about the true state of its finances, and it showed that Enron was facing serious liquidity problems. 
Those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when Enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy. But Enron's disclosure Monday that it faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the exits. In the Wednesday release, Enron CEO Ken Lay said his company was still committed to the merger: ""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees and lenders."" Dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is ""continuing our confirmatory due diligence"" regarding the merger. Neither Enron nor Dynegy returned calls seeking comment. 
After plunging 23% Tuesday to $6.99, Enron was down a staggering 34% at one point Wednesday. It moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at $4.90. Enron shares have lost more than 80% of their value since the company issued its third-quarter earnings release last month. Dynegy dropped $2.44, to $39.26, though it remains substantially above premerger levels. 
At the heart of Enron's trouble is the sense that the company isn't letting on the full extent of its troubles. The selloff in Enron shares began in earnest Oct. 16, when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party transactions. Critics of the company said those deals, in which the company did business with separate entities involving Enron managers, raised serious ethical and disclosure issues. 
The Dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for Enron, since as a big trading partner Dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of Enron's situation. As a result, shares in both companies rallied after the deal's announcement. But Monday's disclosure that Enron faced $690 million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed. According to a Merrill Lynch report cited in The New York Times Wednesday, Dynegy wasn't aware of the $690 million obligation. Critics of the deal wondered whether Enron had told Dynegy about all its obligations. <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10003860.html> 
Liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a filing of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $5 billion of cash in recent weeks. By the end of 2002, Enron has to find around $9 billion to pay back various obligations. It had $1.2 billion in cash on hand as of Nov. 16, according to the filing. 
Tellingly, Dynegy shares haven't plunged along with Enron, suggesting that investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for Enron but not for Dynegy. At current levels, Enron shares are trading at more than a 50% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
J.P. Morgan has taken a leading role in helping Enron. It has lent funds and it helped restructure the $690 million obligation. The bank's stock was down 78 cents to $38.62. ""We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy,"" said James Lee, a top banker at Morgan, in the Enron release.

DYNEGY, ENRON SAY MERGER TO PROCEED

By Myra P. Saefong

1:52 PM ET Nov 21, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Merger partners Enron and Dynegy restated their
commitment Wednesday to completing a deal, on the heels of embattled
Enron's announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay
off a $690 million note set to come due next week.

""We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,""
said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive,  in a
statement.

Shares of Enron (ENE) recovered slightly in afternoon  trading but
remained under pressure.


On heavy volume, the stock -- which had touched $4 earlier in the
session -- was down $1.83 to trade at $5.16, a new 10-year low. Some 84
million shares had changed hands.

Enron declined 23 percent Tuesday after the company revealed the
upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings.

Meanwhile, Dynegy shares lost $1.83 to stand at $39.87.

Enron said that the lead bank on the $690 million debt agreed to extend
the maturity date to mid-December, which will give the company time to
restructure the facility, and added it expects to further restructure
its debt.

""We ... believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to
enhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet, and address
upcoming maturities,"" said Jeff McMahon, chief financial officer, in a
statement.

J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it and other lenders are committed to
helping Enron improve its financial position.

Also, Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with Dynegy and said
it closed on a previously announced $450 million line of credit from
J.P. Morgan, collateralized by the company's Northern Natural Gas Co.

Enron -- which is being acquired by its smaller rival Dynegy (DYN) at a
fire-sale price -- revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Monday that it had to pay off or refinance $690 million in debt
obligations by next Monday or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in
additional payments.

If Enron had missed that deadline and didn't post collateral, investors
had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of
Enron's limited partnerships, the unusual business entities at the
center of the company's murky transactions currently under
investigation.

The SEC filing of Monday also contained yet another restatement of
financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more
than four years of restated earnings figures.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B35D690E0%2D13BE%2D43D9%2D9644%2D1B1CF4896115%7D>

Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock to
""market performer"" from its ""U.S. recommended list,"" citing ""major""
liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the
business it has lost.

CIBC World Markets also cut Enron to a ""hold"" from a ""buy.""

Commerzbank weighed in Wednesday, saying Enron's viability is in doubt.

""We believe the filing clearly shows that Enron remains in a precarious
financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt,""
analysts Andre Meade and Andrew Smith wrote. ""It appears that Enron's
situation could worsen in a number of ways.""

Though Enron's most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation, Meade and Smith characterized the information as ""piecemeal.""

""It appears that the full extent of Enron's problems is not currently
known,"" they said in a note, cautioning clients against investing in
Enron.

Anne,
I'm Pat Weatherspoon managing contracts for EES, EBS and ENA. I have received several phone calls from Melissa Graves regarding the listed subject  matter. Mark Thorne, advised me you are the legal point of contact regarding AEP.  Can you give me some direction on how to reply to Melissa, or the status to the release of these records to AEP. Before Carolyn Gilley was released she told me we were waiting on the legal dept. to give the approval to release the HPL records.

I appreciate your point.  Apparently, there is not a distribution list which is separated by US vs. Europe, etc.  In the interest of time, we got the memo out.  I see no way to fully eliminate some degree of confusion.

the service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.

Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit has request we suspend trading when

i guess i'm thinking along the lines of one central Energy Ops core - with as many centralized functions as possible - running off as many centralized systems as possible - like a bank model - a central processing facility (Houston) - with regional/product 'swat teams' in each/any business units - really just Risk Admin folks and Deal Capture - front end

commercial folks may ask this anyway - especially as a cost saving opportunity - it might be good to suggest it/plan for it in advance.....at least get some thoughts together

Enron Warns of Problems Eroding Profit
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/20/2001
The Wall Street Journal
B16
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a ""demand obligation,"" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
""We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,"" said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Yesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - Wall St worries over Enron deal.
By ANDREW BALLS, ANDREW HILL and GARY SILVERMAN.

11/20/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets. 
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were under the impression that the ""material adverse change"" clause could be triggered.
""There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, or even likely to happen,"" one banker said. ""And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good,"" he added. None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified. 
The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met with officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago. 
The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness. 
Moody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid. 
In justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure. 
But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose. 
According to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, possible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron.

Enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter 
$690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s financial well-being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings Monday. 
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron said it reduced third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors. 
The company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt. 
The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
""We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation,"" said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
Enron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires Enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency Standard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership's assets. 
Enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
If Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investment grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water Trust. 
Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat. 
The turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company's board of directors. 
The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock. 
The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
""The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting,"" Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
Andersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to the company's unusual finances. 
A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor. 
In June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges.

Enron Corp. warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $690-million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a Monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships.
If the debt isn't paid, the partner could liquidate the partnership's assets, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
Enron has already used up its $3-billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash. 
The company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would put its loss at 87 cents a share.

A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a ""review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP,"" said the letter.
Dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. 
Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending.

U.S. Official Calls for Probe Of Andersen, 2 Problem Audits
By Judith Burns

WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a ""special investigation"" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
In a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Andersen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.
Enron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival Dynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 million euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Enron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Management. 
Andersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management's reported earnings in the mid-1990s. 
In addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of directors. 
Given the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen's track record, ""there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process,"" Mr. Dingell wrote.

[Focus on Retirement, Pay and Getting Ahead] 
Passing Up
Some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages. 
Last week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits. 
""In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance,"" says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice leader of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York. 
Alan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associates, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents ""the continuing trend of executives being clueless."" 
(For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from exercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Thomson Financial.) 
Three top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to gain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At US Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the company. 
Firm Relationship 
New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first-year associates. 
For two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a designated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year. 
Jordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by American Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated, ranked the firm last. ""It wasn't an accurate reflection of the firm,"" he says. ""But it was a wake-up call."" 
So, CWT created an ""associate task force"" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was one result. 
Hiring Blitz 
Despite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way. 
ZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently announced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. It has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home. 
""We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have great realtors,"" says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and culture. 
Since August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The company has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects. 
The job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission based. New hires also receive cellphone and car allowances.

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

11/20/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company
The Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question. 
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further. 
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon. 
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September. 
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year. 
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities. 
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced. 
''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' Ms. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.'' 
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms. 
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced. 
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share. 
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9. 
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million. 
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet. 
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''

Decision to locate ConocoPhillips in Houston enhances world's energy capital
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller Conoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital. 
""Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it,"" said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
""All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employee growth base,"" he said. ""It is easier to conduct the business in the Houston market because not only are all the major companies there, all the support is in Houston as well."" 
The dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though the nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each has thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city. 
It all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources lay beneath Texas soil. 
""Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries,"" said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm. ""But certainly with high-speed communications developed over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers. 
""What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into today's oil capital."" 
Shell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting and related companies. 
In recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city. 
""Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place,"" Bill Gilmer, an economist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent publication. ""The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to Hollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit."" 
And, it seems, energy companies to Houston.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Energy deal savings set to increase.
By ANDREW HILL.

11/20/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
ChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003. 
David O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months of the deal, which was completed last month.
Mr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries about the falling oil price. 
""Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don't want to be in this business,"" he told reporters after addressing analysts in New York. 
Mr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident that the ChevronTexaco deal was right. 
ChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas production. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share after tax. 
ChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the rival energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immediately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a further $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the deal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity. 
Mr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at Enron. 
ChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron, and Mr O'Reilly said there was ""a full suite of due diligence"" that needed to be done on other issues at Enron. 
* Enron's lenders welcomed the energy company's openness yesterday following a meeting in New York. Greg Whalley, Enron's president, led the meeting, which was postponed when Dynegy began talks with Enron two weeks ago. 
""Much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job,"" said one. Another banker said Enron management had been ""pretty upfront"" about the problems at the company, although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting.

Enron restates Q3 to deeper loss; toils to restructure $690M payment
AP

Copyright (c) 2001 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) _ As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter results Monday, increasing its loss for the period by three cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. 
``We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,'' he said. 
Palmer said that when Enron's credit rating was reduced it triggered a clause in one of the ``limited partnership agreements that could cause that $690 million obligation to become due beginning next week.'' 
Houston-based Enron, being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share. 
Dynegy is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock. 
In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ``should not be relied upon'' and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the company's earnings reports. 
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million, from $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion. 
In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, or $628 million more than previously reported. 
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations _ trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
In the filing, Enron reiterated it is developing a plan to exit $8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ``below acceptable rates,'' and expects to use the proceeds to repay debt.

Enron restates third-quarter earnings

HOUSTON (AP) - As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter earnings, increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a dlrs 690 million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. 
""We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,"" he said. 
Palmer said the obligation could come due because of Enron's lowered credit rating. When the rating was reduced, it triggered a clause in one of the ""limited partnership agreements that could cause that dlrs 690 million obligation to become due beginning next week.""

By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumbably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
""We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation,"" said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
The merger is expected to go through by next summer. Dynegy, backed by major investor ChevronTexaco Inc., will also assume dlrs 13 billion of Enron debt. 
Enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an acknowledgment that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating partnerships run by company officials. 
The partnerships led to a dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Credit services also have diminished Enron's long-term debt to just above junk grade. 
In the filing, Enron also reiterated it is developing a plan to exit dlrs 8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ""below acceptable rates,"" and should be able to use the proceeds to repay debt. 
Shares of Enron were up 6 cents to dlrs 9.06 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron announced its latest filing after the market close.

USA: Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week. That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships. 
If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. 
Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported. 
It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust. 
Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and ""would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company wrote. 
Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability. 
CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" just one notch above ""junk"" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects commercial paper, to ""Not Prime,"" a junk rating. 
In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices. 
All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner. 
Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity. 
The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock. 
In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of ""the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures."" 
Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Enron Warns That Raft of Problems May Hurt Its Fourth-Quarter Profit

11/19/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron (ENE) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a ""demand obligation,"" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
""We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,"" said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Monday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

Enron Files 10-Q For 3Q With SEC

11/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a share was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end of the quarter. 
As reported, Enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances.
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $618 million on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
In a press release Monday, the company said its earnings of 19 cents a share for the nine-month period of 2001 were increased by 1 cent a share. 

Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements. 

Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting non-core businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 
Enron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the financial impact, but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hurt by employee severance, restructuring and other charges, according to Corporate Filings Alert. 
The company had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at Sept. 30. 
On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002.

Fears Mount Over Enron/Dynasty Deal
Bruce Francis, Kathleen Hays

(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNFN ANCHOR, MARKETS IMPACT: There are mounting fears about the fate of the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) /Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) deal. Financial Times once again has a scoop. Robert Thomson is the U.S. Managing Editor of the FT joining us now with details. Robert what`s going on I thought this was suppose to be a done deal? 
ROBERT THOMSON, FINANCIAL TIMES, U.S. MANAGING EDITOR: Well that`s right Kathleen but the interesting thing that make it perhaps not so done a deal is what we might call the materially adverse clause. That there is a change in the conditions surrounding Enron that makes (INAUDIBLE) a downgrade of them possible and really leaves the financial institutions exposed to them. And these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the Financial Times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize.
HAYS: Well I must say I think this is very interesting and I`m surprised not that I`m an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that Enron was getting the deal done with Dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table. So what, what do you think? What are you hearing that they`re finding now that makes things look worst than they already look? 
THOMSON: Well really that`s the issue. To be quite honest we don`t know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that Enron is in this situation that it`s now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that (INAUDIBLE) surrounding Enron still have it and that they suspect that Dynegy might have it. It looks quite more (INAUDIBLE) the deal. Now Dynegy is saying but we`re going ahead with this yes there is that clause there, yes it covers us in case we find something that we don`t like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we don`t` feel it will have to activate it. But of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it. 
HAYS: Go ahead Robert I`m sorry. 
THOMSON: So, but the truth is you know the full extent of Enron`s exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transaction`s the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it. 
HAYS: What happens if the deal falls through? What happen to Enron? 
THOMSON: Well there`s a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this there`s certainly concern in the banking community. Again, that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to Enron isn`t fully comprehended and frankly that`s why they spoke to the Financial Times because they thought well there`s an impression that this is a done deal, that the Enron problem is solved. They`re saying actually not so. 
HAYS: Wow. Well I think we have just enough time to take a look at you`re you got us something in China again. You take us to that world part of the world frequently what`s going on there. 
THOMSON: Yeah we Beijing (INAUDIBLE) here. Essentially the IFC the International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank is taking a large stake in Chinese Bank in Nanjing (ph). That is amazing really. It`s by far the largest stake, $27 million, 15 percent in the Nanjing(ph) City Bank and it`s really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in Chinese banks over the next year or so. There are two small ones there already where people have taken 3, 5 percent in Chinese banks but for the first time International institutions are in a position where they can think about Chinese retail banking in a serious way. 
HAYS: OK Robert well thank you very much I guess that`s something for investors to watch. Particularly people who are global investors.

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

     (Adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week.)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which agreed to
a takeover by Dynegy Inc. after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy, revised third-quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
$690 million note next week.

     The Houston-based company lowered results by 3 cents a share,
bringing its third-quarter loss to 87 cents, or $664 million,
according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing.
Liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth-
quarter earnings by $700 million before taxes, Enron said.

     The disclosures don't indicate that Enron is in much worse
shape than on Nov. 8, said John Olson, an energy analyst at
Sanders Morris Harris. That's when Enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by $586 million, reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books.

     ``I don't think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third-quarter earnings (again) considering they
restated earnings for the last four years,'' said Olson, who
doesn't own shares of Dynegy or Enron. ``I don't think it's a
problem.''

     Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cut
Enron's fourth-quarter earnings. Enron is obligated to back
Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because
Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by
$700 million, the filing said.

                       Partnership Problems

     Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships. Dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if Enron's litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to $3.5 billion or more. Enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits.

     Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books. Its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. The company wrote
off $1.01 billion in investments in water, telecommunications and
retail-energy sales in the third quarter.

     A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by
Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the $690
million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the company
said.

                        Brazilian Liability

     Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership
that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     ``If we can't talk lenders into refinancing, there is the
possibility that . . . note would be due next week,'' said Karen
Denne, an Enron spokeswoman.

     As of Friday, the company had $1.3 billion in cash on hand.
It expects to close on $450 million in additional financing
tomorrow, and to complete $800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year. It's also trying to find investors who will put $500
million to $1 billion into the company.

     The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral. It received $1.5 billion from
ChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In
return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through.

     Enron closed on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday that was secured
with assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. It expects to
close on another $450 million loan, secured with other Northern
Natural Gas assets, this week, Denne said. The commitment for the
loans was announced Nov. 1.


                      $3.9 Billion Liability

     The company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes. A further drop in its
debt rating, which would put it below investment grade, would
trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies, Enron said.

     The rating drop would force it to repay $2.4 billion in debt
owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million in debt taken on by Marlin
Water Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, didn't grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships, Enron said. The SEC is also investigating the
partnerships, which were run by Enron executives.

     The filing was released after the stock market closed. Shares
of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy rose $1.13 to $43.60.
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy and is
providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout, fell
54 cents to $82.91.


ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)
2001-11-19 19:53 (New York)

ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)

     (Updates with Enron reducing third-quarter results in last
paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
Dynegy Inc., said David O'Reilly, chief executive officer of
ChevronTexaco Inc., which is helping to back Dynegy's purchase.

     ChevronTexaco is ``paying particular attention to the
litigation risk,'' though ``we still think it's a good deal for
Dynegy and an even better deal for ChevronTexaco,'' Reilly said at
an analyst meeting in New York.

     ChevronTexaco, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, owns 27
percent of Dynegy. It agreed to provide Dynegy $2.5 billion as
part of the Enron purchase. Dynegy can cancel the bid if Enron's
legal liabilities, including investor suits, exceed $3.5 billion.
Enron said today in a regulatory filing it can't calculate the
cost of shareholder suits.

     Dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival Enron, the largest
energy trader, for stock and debt now valued at $20.7 billion.
Enron's stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt.

     Gold Bennett Cera & Sidner LLP filed a class action suit in
Houston today alleging Enron misrepresented its business and
results. Other investors have filed similar suits.

     ChevronTexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months, O'Reilly said. ``There is no transaction
that is risk free,'' he said.

     Shares of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06 today. They have
tumbled 89 percent this year. Dynegy gained $1.13 to $43.60. The
stock has declined 22 percent this year. Both companies are based
in Houston.

     ChenvronTexaco, based in San Francisco, fell 54 cents to
$82.91.

     Earlier this month, Enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates. Enron ousted its chief financial officer, and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates.

     Enron reduced third-quarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a $690 million note
this month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.




Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week
2001-11-19 18:16 (New York)

Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov.
27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt.

     Repayment was triggered by the Nov. 12 downgrade in Enron's
senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by Standard & Poor's, the
company said in a securities filing.

     Enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said.

    Without repayment, partners in a Limited Partnership that owns
natural gas assets in Brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     A further drop in its debt rating, which would put it below
investment grade, would trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies.

     The rating drop would trigger repayment of $2.4 billion in
debt owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million owed by Marlin Water
Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Enron is being bought by Dynegy Inc. for $25 billion in stock
and debt. Enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $2 billion, the
Dynegy deal could collapse.

    The filing was released after the stock market closed.  Shares
of Houston-based Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy shares rose
$1.13 to $43.60. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, fell 54 cents to $82.91.



Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow
2001-11-19 14:35 (New York)

Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Azurix Corp., Enron Corp.'s
water unit, may have to sell assets if it can't find financing to
continue operations, the company said in a regulatory filing.

     Enron took Azurix public in June 1999 and then, after the
water company's stock plunged, took it private and paid off
investors in March.

     Azurix isn't sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$113.3 million in long-term debt, including bank loans, that
matures before Sept. 30 at a ``reasonable'' cost, it said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
company also had $326.3 million in short-term debt as of Sept. 30.

     The loans are Azurix's ``primary sources of liquidity,'' the
filing said. If the company can't raise the funds, it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash, the filing said.

     If those asset sales don't generate enough money, ``Azurix
may need to sell other assets, which could result in Azurix
incurring losses in future periods,'' the company said.

     Azurix, though it still must file with the SEC, no longer
trades as a separate stock. The shares of Houston-based Enron fell
8 cents to $8.92 in early afternoon trading.

     Enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction currently valued at $24.9 billion.
The buyout came after Enron's shares plunged amid an SEC
investigation of the company's dealings with affiliated
partnerships.



U.S.'s Dingell Seeks Probe of Arthur Andersen, Dow Jones Says
2001-11-19 15:24 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative John
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, has requested a special
investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP's audits of Enron Corp. and
Waste Management Inc., Dow Jones Newswires reported.

     Dingell sent a letter to Public Oversight Board Chairman
Charles Bowsher asking for the review, the newswire said.

      Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, served
as Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring
investors the company's financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles. Earlier this month, the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over
four-and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion
because of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.

     In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of Waste
Management, Inc. Andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
Deloitte & Touche, Dow Jones said.


ENRON RESTATES Q3 RESULTS
From CBS.MarketWatch.com

By Leticia Williams

8:35 PM ET Nov 19, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Embattled Enron Corp. restated its third-quarter
earnings Monday,  increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share
to 87 cents, according to an SEC filing.

Houston-based Enron (ENE), which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to
escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street  confidence,
also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20  cents a share.

Dynegy (DYN) is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.

Enron must also pay off or refinance $690 million in debt obligations
by Nov. 26 or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in additional payments,
according to the SEC filing.

If the company doesn't make the payment on that date, the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable.

In addition, Enron may sell the limited partnership's assets for
amounts below their carrying values.

""The net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
Enron's obligation, "" according to the company's 10Q filed Monday with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron is in talks with lenders to ""develop a mutually acceptable""
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $690 million
note.

If the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade, it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional $3.9 billion, the company said.

Standard &amp; Poor's currently has the company rated at BBB-, a notch
above speculative grade. Fitch rates the company's credit at BBB-,
evolving. Moody's Investor services rates the company Baa3, under
review. All ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the
corporation.

A note trigger would force the company to repay, refinance or cash
collaterize certain facilities in the amount of $3.9 billion, which
primarily consists of $2.4 billion in Osprey Trust and $915 million in
Marlin Water Trust, Enron said in the filing.

The company's (ENE) shares gained 6 cents to close at $9.06.

Company officials didn't immediately reply to questions about where it
would raise the money, since it's effectively barred from the capital
markets.

Subject:	Non-Elective IT Support Staffing for EBS -  2002
Sensitivity:	Confidential

Following this week's discussions, we have recalculated the absolute minimum number of people required to keep your present systems in production.  In recalculating this number, we have eliminated everything except that which is required for ""non-elective"" maintenance.  Although many of the systems have been in operation for some time, we still frequently encounter problems which interrupt production.  Such events require emergency attention and are what we refer to as ""non-elective"" maintenance.  Therefore, in recalculating these support staff, we have excluded any effort for improvements or other changes that the users have previously identified for next year's work.  Also, we are suggesting excluding any further effort on the Saber Settlement, GeoQual, Market Intelligence, DPC Tax & Media Services systems which we will simply wrap up as those are and put them in ""moth balls"" for possible future use.  As the result of this process, we have come to a core minimum number of 19 people required to simply ensure that the remaining systems continue to function.  The only way that we can logically reduce this core number any further would be to ""turn off"" other production systems.  Although we recognize that the concept of turning-off other production systems is unattractive, it would be far better to have this happen in a planned, orderly fashion than having them crash in an unrecoverable condition later.

As we discussed at the Lunch meeting yesterday, we have previously reviewed all of the EBS systems to determine the minimum staffing required to keep the system operational (maintenance) and to meet any currently identified modifications (future development).  The summarized numbers are shown on the attached cover sheet by each system with accompanying backup details.  The details cover major functionalities of systems, magnitude of system (i.e. # of deals, # facilities) and other information that Greg Piper asked in the meeting.  Also shown on the last column is an estimate of the impact on our users and customers, if the computer systems were no longer available.   I look forward to discussing these issues with you on Monday, and please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

"To lighten up your day,","Hi,
 I just came across following discussion on Economics that provides an interesting insight.

Economic philosophies explained in terms of two cows:
Socialism - You have two cows.  You give one to your neighbor.
Communism - You have two cows.  The government takes both and gives you milk.
Fascism - You have two cows.  The government takes them both and sells you the milk.
Capitalism - You have two cows.  You sell one and buy a bull.
Bureaucracy - You have two cows.  The government takes them both, shoots one,  milks the other, pays you for the milk , then pours it down the drain.
Corporate - You have two cows.  You downsize one, then require the other one to produce the milk of four cows, then act surprised when it falls dead.
Democracy - You have two cows.  You are taxed to the point where you have to sell them both so that the government can support a man in a foreign country who has one cow, which was a gift from your country.

Hope you enjoyed.

"RE: Post Mortem on ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC","good summary - we will make sure our risk guys understand what they need to do when setting up a new commodity

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Post Mortem on ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC

Problem:  
14 ERMS EGM books were not picked up in RisktRAC due to a mismatch of attributes between ERMS and RisktRAC.  

Root Cause: The over riding issue is that the current processes to keep RisktRAC up to date are so manual that the probability of errors such as this occuring are very high (point in fact - I had 1.5 people doing this last year and now have 4 + 2 managers to support + 1 director to support them).  Specifically, what occured in this case is:

Attribute mismatches happen frequently when there is more than one commodity per in the source system book.  When setting up new books, the book admin must indicate that there is more than one commodity in the book (or that the commodity identifier ie BRN has changed to BRNT) so Risk Analytics can set up the appropriate number of books (there is not a one to one ratio between ERMS books and RistRAC books).  In this case, these books were already being used for BRNT trades.  At the end of Aug/ early Sept these books also started being used for BRN and BRCM positions as well.  The additional usage for these books was not communicated to Risk Analytics therefore no additional books were set up in RisktRAC.  Additionally, there was no effective compensating control for Risk Analytics to catch this problem.

Procedures to ensure this doesn't happen again:
Short term
1) Training - training sessions for book admins to remind them of RisktRAC requirements- pilot class has been taught and first ""real"" class is Wednesday of this week.
2) Compensating control to be put in place - Risk Analytics is creating a role to review all exception reporting available on a daily basis (whether a book came from the source system but was not picked up by RisktRAC, whether a book was picked up but not included for VAR purposes etc).

Medium term
Greenlight - revamping benchmarks to pull from RMS (table where data is kept for RisktRAC) so the positions per ERMS can be easily reconciled to RisktRAC, other projects within RisktRAC being identified.

Long term
Strategic vision of RisktRAC (front end & all exception reporting needed) - user requirements being developed.

Wanda's QU's not answered above:
1) How long have these books not been in RisktRAC - Our best guess is end-August, early Sept when the books started to be used for several commodity types.
2) What is the impact on VAR?  -  The preliminary VAR for Thursday's trading was $12.928 million.  This export did not have the 14 books in it.  The final VAR for Thursday morning was $12.892 million. The final had about 10 of the 14 books - the other four hadn't yet been set up.  .2% - clearly immaterial
3) What was the volume missing?  300K barrels (per EGM).  - total positions were 5.3 mil BBL for Thursday's trading - approximatly 6% - a bit more material.

What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
""It's not getting any better,"" said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
""They've been cut off from so many people,"" said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
""We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,"" Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating ""evolving."" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal,"" Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a ""due diligence"" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. 
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. 
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. 
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. 
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. 
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. 
""The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. 
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN 
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. 
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. 
""This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business,"" said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. 
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""There's nothing like accounting to scare people,"" said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
""Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is,"" said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
""The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars,"" said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
""We're trying to figure out a good play,"" said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
""People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it,"" a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, ""We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides."" 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. ""Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds,"" said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
""A lot of the guys are still very skeptical,"" said a bond trader at a New York bank. ""But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds."" 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
""We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive,"" the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source
By Christina Cheddar

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal,"" said John Sousa. ""I can't elaborate any further at this time.""
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. 

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron ""locked down"" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from ""pending""' or ""threatened"" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving ""the perceived liquidity crisis,"" the source said.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.





ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.


Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.



Getting it done

_______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a ""crapshoot"" as to whether the deal gets done.

""I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term,"" he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. ""Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle.""

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

""Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it,"" Hilton said. ""If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache.""

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with ""the
parties involved in the transaction"" related to the structure of the
deal.



Top Of The News 
Enron In Free Fall 
Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET 

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush <http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/12/gwbush.html> and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. 

Dynegy's (nyse: DYN <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=DYN> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=DYN>) buyout of Enron (nyse: ENE <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ENE> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ENE>) was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. 

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. 

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for ""personal reasons."" 

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. 

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. 

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. 

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. 

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CVX> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CVX> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CVX>), may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. 

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it ""markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world."" While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. 

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. 

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. 

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means ""intestines;"" they decided to drop the ""te"" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.

"Operational Risk Management","
As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.  

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.   

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.  

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
	
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books""
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances 
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.  

Thanks,

Rick Buy

"VAR & CAS Positions January 07, 2002","Here is the list for Friday's positions.  To give you an update on what the daily calcs are used for, information from RisktRAC and CAS is being pulled on an ad hoc basis to fulfill requests from both external and internal personnel/companies.  As such, books with any positions should be calced as often as possible.   

Also for the 31st, my understanding after talking to several groups is that certain groups have only limited resources right now and will not be able to provide accurate calcs for the 31st before late this week or early next week.  Please keep me up to date on the status of your information.  Once all books have been calced, officialized, and exported (to Athena) for the 31st we will rerun VAR and produce a DPR.  

Open questions:
Cindy - lets discuss what should be done for ECTRIC on an ongoing basis as well as for the 31st.
Kori - do any of the books listed with you as the BA have positions - if not we can inactivate them
Jeff - there are a couple of gas books that seem to have positions, NG-PR-OPT-PRC (which is inactive) and NG-PRICE-GDL.  Who can I get the status from for these?

Thanks

Shona

PS:  When you review the information regarding CAS - no position means no 3rd party position.  Since not all groups have deleted their intercompany positions, there may be books listed below as ""no position"" which do have VAR/P&L risk.

"Licenses, services and NetCo Deal","Want to clarify if the Estate has the right to do a services deal with a 3rd party with our copy of the licenses after the NetCo deal is done.  
 
Here is the issue (as per an old draft of the Assignment and License Agreement).
 
In the current deal, Enron assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to NetCo all of the rights, title and interest in and to the software and intellectual property rights.  In other words, NetCo will be the owner of the Enron developed applications or software including EOL, TAGG, ERMS, DCAF, Sitara, Unify, EnPower, etc.  Enron or the estate gets back a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty free license of all of them for any purpose.  I am not sure why the original deal was done this way as opposed to Enron continuing to own all the software and just granting a perpetual, royalty free license to all the applications to NetCo, but I realize we are in the 11th hour.
 
What it also says is that Enron shall not have the right to grant any sublicense to any third party for use within the field of ""wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity within North America.""  It also says that NetCo can't, as long as Enron owns 20% of NetCo, assign or license the software to any third party or use the software for any of the prohibited commodities.
 
Is trading the act of buying and selling of the commodities?  Once a NetCo deal is completed, we want to have NetCo and the estate agree that trading is buying and selling, not service or fulfillment.  I would like the Estate to maintain the right and ability to sub-license all the applications associated with logistics and settlement (not EOL or those systems associated with buying and selling and order capture) to a third party that would have the opportunity to build a mid and back office processing and service business around those sub-licenses in all commodities, including gas and power in North America.  The Estate may even outsource to this 3rd party and take back a service agreement from this 3rd party as well as some of the future profit it generates from this service company.  This would allow the estate to get value for the applications and associated employees on a service deal.  NetCo should not be concerned about fulfillment as being defined as competition.  Also, the estate is keeping CommodityLogic and it is much more valuable as a tool within a complete services entity.
 
I have not heard whether the final purchase and sale agreement has a non-compete or not. If there is not one, then doing the above should be no issue.
 
Need an answer quick on if we need to change anything or if you think that we have this right as written or if you think NetCo has an issue.
 
Also, I assume that we can use our licenses within the estate and its affiliates and subs any way we want in all commodities.
 
Thanks. 

Greg Piper

David Port and Rick Buy are requesting to see curve validations (immediately).  Primary concerns are that we sufficiently address curve validations requirements per risk management policy.  Please forward to me any curve validations (most recent) you have regarding your desk.
Wish it wasn't on such a short fuse,
Thanks,

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

This definitley does not sound like HPL.  I will ask around and see if anyone knows anything.  

However, there are about 1,400 boxes that do relate to HPL in a couple of conference rooms over at 3AC.  They need to go to AEP.  In additon there are approxiamately 12,000 boxes that relate to HPL at Iron Mountain that belong to AEP, however many of these boxes also contained other non-HPL information that needs to be removed prior to AEP taking possesion of them.  Carolyn Gilley had a contracter working on reviewing the contents of these boxes and removing the non-HPL stuff.  AEP is in the process sending a demand letter to us asking for these boxes as they have upcoming tax audits and other needs for the boxes.  Who can work on this for us?  AEP is willing to fund a team of contractors to complete this.

I have heard through several sources that AEP has purchased the Enron Nordic team in Oslo.  This creates several issues that we must address:

Did AEP purchase any systems and/or contracts?
Are these employees still located in our office and if so are they assuming the building lease and associated expenses?
Do they still have access to our systems?
Who, if anyone, was not included in the AEP purchase?
Many of the deals were executed under ECTRIC - Nordic Branch; is this treated similar to ECTRIC?
Since ECTRIC still has not declared bankruptcy, we need to evaluate these portfolios immediately.
We probably do not have Commercial leadership in Oslo; therefore, we need to develop an action plan for that office.  

I believe that there were only Power and Weather transactions managed by Thor Lien in the Oslo office.


If you have any questions or additional information for me, call at Ext. 31957.

"Updated IT Savings","Sally,
 
here is a revised version of the savings for ENA, EGM, EIM, Back Office, Frameworks, and Corporate Systems.
 
There have been a number of changes as follows :-
 
Back Office
The headcount numbers have changed because the original cuts took into account bugeted headcount counts rather than working from our currrent position. Ramesh Rao spent some time today revising those figures to better represent what it will really take to address the three scenarios. Also the changes reflect what it will take to support EA business only.  EES - at least, part of it - was supposed to be integrated into UNIFY early next year and therefore EES had a 20% allocation from the backoffice.  
 
EGM/EIM
Jeff made some slight alterations to make sure that current employee counts were accurate, and base cont/consultant headcount more on average budgeted for next year rather than actuals today. They assumed in budgeting that contractors and consultants would be reduced next year as new dev in Thunderball, Freight and EIM started to be completed
 
The Summary page now shows savings rather than totals and all values are scaled to show millions....
 
regards
 
Steve

"IMPORTANT -- Enron Global Markets real estate leases","We need to pull together a list of all non-residential real estate leases for premises used by EGM and its businesses.

To date, I have identified five such leases, listed below by address and landlord:

(1) 2103 Southlake Blvd., Southlake, Texas (Comercis, Inc.)
(2) 500 Lee Street East, Charleston, West Virginia (Laidley Developers Limited Partnership)
(3) 780 Third Avenue, New York, New York (TIAA)
(4) Penn Center West, Bldg Two, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Penn Center Management Corp.)
(5) 150 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL  60601 (BfG Immobilien-Investment Gesellschaft mbH Ltd.)

Please let me know ASAP if you are aware of ANY leased premises held or used by EGM or its related businesses that is not on the above list.  While all of the above leases are office leases, we need a complete list of ALL non-residential real estate leases (including warehouse leases, land leases, etc.).  Please be overinclusive in responding to this information request, as I am including premises that EGM shares with other Enron business units and is charged an allocation.

Thank you all for your attention to and cooperation with this important information request -- Bob Bruce

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Subject: Independent Kiodex analysis of EnronOnline risk?


Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.  Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

Thanks for all the hard work.

"FW: 1998 to 2001 Headcount","
Suzanne  -- here is a summary of our headcount by group from 98 to 2001 (plan)

There is some verbage discussion about major business changes that have had an effect, and also we attached 2 graphs which show the Huge increase in the number of new deals (from the introduction of EOL in fall of 1999).  1000% for Gas and 500% for all products on an average basis, which would certainly account for a level of headcount growth, which we believe has been minimal in relation to the huge growth in transactions and commodities since 1999

Hopefully, this will help you answer the questions.  I am happy to discuss any other info we can provide or slice the info a different way, if necessary.  Just let me know.

"Stats - utilization of the ISC"," 
Sally and Wes,

The Integrated Solution Center has prepared a report for ENA called ""Monthly Dashboard""  for the month of May 2001.

The purpose of this report is to provide you the statistics of your business area's utilization of the ISC via the SAP Hotline. The report's content was carefully selected to summarize the criticality of issues.  Each priority level is broken down by the total number of tickets as well as the number of exceptions.  The report also presents the grand total of tickets and total number of exceptions, which are benchmarked against the SLA.

The ISC recognizes the importance of communication with our customers will therefore provide this report to you via email on a monthly basis.

Should you have any questions, please contact Lisa Darnell, Manager of Customer Assurance, 713-345-6734.

Thanks,

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Enron Europe New Account Opening Policy","Sally / Bill / Shawn

This is a quick note to let you know that as of Monday 1 October Enron Europe will be introducing a robust New Account Opening Policy for all trading counterparties. The Operational Credit team will be responsible for ensuring the smooth roll-out of the policy and for ensuring compliance with it.

The salient points of the policy are that:

traders will be more accountable for relevant Regulatory and internal compliance concerning their counterparties;
money laundering checks will be completed for all new counterparties prior to trading;
the Compliance Group will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading;
RAC will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading.

These controls are already in place for the majority of Enron Europe's counterparties, however, the introduction of the Policy enables us to demonstrate this more effectively to the Regulators and to monitor compliance more easily.

I attach the policy below.

 
If you have any questions pls give me a call on +44 7783 5261.

Thanks   -   Sam

Mike:  Do you have time to get together on Thursday to review the budget data that you have in hand?  Assumptions regarding number of employees within business units and the timing of the sale or shut-down of certain lines of business have a direct impact on the ENW revised budget for 2002.  --Sally

Rick:  Do you feel that the revised budgets that your team has received are ""baked enough"" so that it makes sense for us to relook at the ENW budget in light of revised plans for the various business units?  My understanding is that the business plans that Jim Fallon had asked the various wholesale business units to complete by December 21 have not yet been submitted to Jim.  Which would lead me to ask whether or not the revised 2002 budgets that you have are far enough along in the process for us to use in re-evaluating the ENW budget.  
 
Let me know your thoughts on your degree of comfort with the revised budgets and who on your staff we could work with to get the necessary information to rework the ENW budget, if necessary.  Thanks.  --Sally

ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally

I understand your point, but we will have to pass at this time.

We do own an equity stake in Kiodex and that could effect the view as
well as we do a significant number of transactions off EnronOnline that
would not be captured.

Subject: Independent Kiodex analysis of EnronOnline risk?


Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our
Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking
that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position
might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.
Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other
dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an
independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and
baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty

IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYN
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
""Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,"" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14
By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones News Service

Of Dow Jones Newswires 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to ""BBB-"" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. 
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. 
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. 
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. 
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. 
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. 
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. 
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. 
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. 
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. 
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;

Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus ""give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest,"" Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron ""locked down"" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal

11/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant's acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal's breaking clause, dealers said. 
At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. 
Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. 
""People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage,"" said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. 
The deal with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. 
Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. 
""At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued,"" said Jefferies' Hogan.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.
By Janet McGurty

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. 
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.
""The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms,"" said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. 
""Escape clauses"" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. 
""Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness,"" he said. 
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
""Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place,"" Heim said. ""Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?"" 
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. 
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. 
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. 
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. 
""Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. 
""How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?"" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. 
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. 
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. 
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. 
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. 
""Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans,"" he said. 
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was ""completely indefensible,"" he said. 
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. 
Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..

USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.

11/26/2001

By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed
Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks 
following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad 
revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. 
In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between 
the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 
0.01 percentage point. 
""I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially 
with Treasury interest rates going up,"" said one trader. ""Absolute 
corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive."" 
Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed 
Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for 
risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds 
are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where 
investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic 
downturn won't be deep or long. 
""The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated 
economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for 
risk,"" wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a 
report dated Monday. ""While the severity and swiftness of the bond 
market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic 
view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend 
overweight positions."" 
This week's forward calendar remains quiet. 
In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their 
yields fell to 4.971 percent. 
ENRON 
Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron 
Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge 
with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its 
investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 
billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured 
and coming due within 13 months. 
Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by 
mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk 
status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers 
believe, is Enron's banks. 
""The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain 
as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out 
fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve 
their risk-profile under multiple scenarios,"" said CreditSights. 
""The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new 
secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity 
investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 
billion in bank loans,"" wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for 
GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. ""If Dynegy 
backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank 
renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as 
the patsies."" 
Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 
percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on 
the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first 
reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. 
Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest 
level since early 1989. 
DATA 
Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 
percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 
percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond 
spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. 
For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while 
investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and 
Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the 
respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting ""the perfect storm"" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. 
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron."" 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he said. ""I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility."" 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,"" he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,"" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
""One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,"" O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's AV Birla group denies bid for Enron unit.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6) 
BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company.
""There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested,"" a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. 
Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. 
The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company. 
An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. 
""We have not received any official communication from them,"" the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. 
The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. 
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL 
Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. 
Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. 
Tata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake. 
The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. 
Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd 
Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems 
But the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. 
Two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price
declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on
concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital,
threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.

     ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The
question is the survivability of Enron.''

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met
today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds
convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate
until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled
its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1
p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's
6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the
dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26
percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.

     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for
Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.
Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after
the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost it $1.01 billion.

     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a
bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the
$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in
Washington.

     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited
partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an
investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this
month restated its earnings for the past four years.

                        Talks on $1 Billion

     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy
share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21
percent more than Enron's share price that day.

     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more
than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the
difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price
indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.

     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to
close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading
Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to
$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies
are based in Houston.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,
or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a
week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for
comment.

     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though
it maintained an investment grade.

                          `More Problems'

     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head
of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is
increased concern in the market that there may be more problems
that are yet to be disclosed.''

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.

     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first
time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has
less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the
company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be
cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in
debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be
hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila
Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron
because of credit concerns.

     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it
likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone
company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the
credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up
further.''

     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a
quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.

     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake
as part of a transaction to be completed today.



Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating
2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)

Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have
fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the
energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.
will erode its credit rating.

     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at
$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according
to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9
percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to
compensate for the increased risks of the securities.

     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors
Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at
Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it
may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with
about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial
partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.

     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a
detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,
senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at
$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,
according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from
5.4 percent.

     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at
S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies
are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's
buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.

     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron
is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5
billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.

     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years
so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''
Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't
understand they'll walk away.''

     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which
come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks
ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase
would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30
to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92
percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to
$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.



ENRON SHARES SLIDES TO ALL-TIME LOW

By CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,
crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast
additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival
Dynegy.

Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before
closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an
agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value
in the past month.

Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand
at $39.25.

The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy
and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in
which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding
Enron share.

However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of
its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500
million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.

""We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading
business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with
counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals,"" A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a
research note Friday.

Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under
the current terms, the analysts said.



Chance of Dynegy backing out

_______________________________________________________________________

On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's
latest stock drop to ""growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)
deal is not so likely.""

He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is ""not very favorable"" but
in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay ""afloat"" while
working on closing the deal.


Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to
mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was
bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>

The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion
in cash on its hands, Heim said, but ""the event moves Enron's merger one
step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the
merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or
restructure, the merger deal.""

Heim has a ""sell"" rating on the stock.

"ENW/ISC Update","Team -

I wanted to give you a brief update on some of the transition discussions that have been occurring over the last few days.  The ISC's Steering Committee is participating in a series of working sessions with Enron Networks (ENW) related to our current service offerings and critical business processes.  These discussions are designed to assist ENW in understanding the complexities of the many systems and processes supported by the ISC and not as some of you may have heard focusing on reducing headcount in the ISC.  I can tell you that our discussions with ENW have been very positive.  We are being recognized for the significant contributions that we make to support Enron's core businesses and have been identified as a critical group.

I understand that this is a very difficult time for everyone.  I would like to encourage each of you to talk with either myself or your Steering Committee member if you have specific questions or concerns.  Furthermore, I will be arranging weekly ISC All Employee Meetings starting immeadiately after Thanksgiving to address many of your questions and to share feedback and updates.

Thank you for all of your continued hard work....

Subject:	Enterprise Wide Risk Management

Hello, everyone.  I'm hoping you know of someone who would be a good fit for an interesting opportunity in Market Risk Management in RAC:

We're looking for a director level accountant or risk management operations person who can join the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) group within Market Risk Management to work on the Asset/Liability piece of Enterprise Risk Management project as we team up with Vince Kaminski's Research group on this challenging new initiative.

The ideal candidate would have Enron experience and be a good project manager, accustomed to working in self-directed situations, able to work with and gain the team support of  mid and upper level management in  research, accounting, risk management operations, finance, treasury, RAC, the business units, etc..  They would need to be able to articulate for top support and commercial management any project issues and implementation challenges, and would be working with risk mgmt operations and the business units on the implementation efforts and process design.  Someone able to take full responsibility for this long term project from its infancy through completion, designing a plan of attack, and then leading the implementation effort.  This person might also act as a consultant for SRM's other initiatives that impact accounting.  Ideally, of course, this person would understand risk management (risk books, trading operations, etc.), but someone who understands the different types of risks inherent in our strategic assets and accrual accounting contracts might also be a good fit if they're self-motivated and willing to dig in and learn the risk management business.

I think it's a great opportunity for someone to broaden their resume and gain market risk management expertise.  We've met with top risk management consultants, and this is a cutting edge initiative that will put us head and shoulders above our peers.

If you want to forward this to potential candidates, below are some links to websites that may provide some overview information on asset-liability / EW risk management (I haven't reviewed the sites myself yet).  Also, Vince's outline on Enterprise Risk Management from early last year is attached below.  

Please call me if you know of someone who might be interested.

Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

As part of pulling together Data Room for possible EBS sale, we are asked to come up with information regarding in-house developed software and labor cost. I would like to have your direction on the policy question whether to include Enfiber and Sabor Settlement systems.  Sabor Settlement system is using Unify Settlement as the foundation and Enfiber is patterned after EnPower which potentially could give some valuable competitive insight into our Trading.  Do you think these systems should be included in the EBS sales package?  As shown on the attachment, those systems are included at the present time.  Thank you.

"Update on SAP System Response","As you may recall, the SAP system response time was slow during the September Quarter-end close period. The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root causes of this issue and can report that significant progress has been made.  With the October month-end close fast approaching, we want to provide you with an update as to the progress made in identifying and addressing the root causes for slow system response.

Poor Performing Programs
The ISC has identified a number of poor performing programs.  Some program redesign has already occurred with continued efforts proceeding through year end.  In addition, system and data base parameters as well as indexes have been tuned. These actions have resulted in improvements that should enable Enron to realize better system response in the upcoming close.

Workload Distribution
The ISC has identified jobs, both scheduled and user submitted, that result in system ""bottlenecks"".  We have accelerated the purchase of system hardware to provide additional capacity and expect this upgrade to occur prior to year-end close. In addition, the ISC has implemented a plan to provide business users with more information regarding efficient methods of report execution.  Workshops are currently being conducted with key ""close-users"" from the various business units to provide techniques that will enable more efficient report execution during the close process. 

Improved Close Monitoring
The ISC has been working to heighten the monitoring of key close jobs in order to more effectively identify and resolve close related issues. An initiative is underway to improve the utilization of automated tools to better monitor, identify, and escalate close-related problems.  

Communication Strategy Implement
The ISC has established a plan to more effectively communicate to our customers in the event of future system performance issues.  This plan will ensure that information will be provided to users regarding system performance and resolution status in a timely manner.

Please feel free to contact me if you would like additional details regarding our efforts to improve overall system performance.

"Employee Breakfast - ENN Article?","Sally,

I was part of the employee breakfast this morning and thought it went well.  

As an idea, my group (Laura Johnson) publishes the  Enron Net Works News intranet site.  I know you've got an article out there already.  Would you like to use ENN as a forum for answering some of the questions or perhaps making a statement about ""leadership""?  

I'll be glad to send Laura your way and hold up the current publication so your message is timely to the troops.

The following spreadsheets represent net generated positions on bullets and strips through the date indicated on the name of the spreadsheet.  I only looked back 90 days, so it won't include any of the strip trading (not a lot) done prior to July 25.  If you want me to have these included, let me know.

"RE: information for the creditors committee","FYI- The request in the attachment for ""Number of Active Transactions as of 11/30""  should actually read, ""Number of Active Counterparties as of 11/30"".  I hope this helps clarify the request.

As we discussed yesterday, here is the list of information that we need to gather to put into the booklets.  Please give us information (Chris, Keith, Susie, Susan and me) information as you get it.  The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com.

Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

Subject:	IT Plans for Estate

Greg,

Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the estate's ability to service IT requests.  The number of people that remain in the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we're receiving resignations now).  With this in mind, I would like to have the ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and potentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accenture or CGEY).  We would need to move the estate employees into this company and incentivize them to stay.  The consulting company could then supplement the staff and the Enron estate employees could now have a career path at the consulting company. 

To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and processing services to other companies.  By the way, this could be done for other commodities outside gas and power.  The deal would have to include royalty payments to the estate for each additional services agreement.  The intent is to make the services company into a thriving business.  We would also want to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.  We could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.

All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estate while the businesses wind down or start up.  We must make sure that the NETCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in some capacity and continue to develop the applications.

As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.  There are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we cannot maintain a fully operational production quality system.  These deals must either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the above referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline).

I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.

I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.  I'll also have my Blackberry but reception is poor on the island!

Have a great holiday.

Beth

"RE: EBS-Sale Preparation","Ed,

I would recommend that these systems not be included in the asset sale of EBS, both of these applications contain proprietary technology for Enron that is considered a competitive advantage.  I think it is also important to note that Sabor (EBS - Unify) is not yet complete (in production),  and if included should not be represented as a completed solution.

Everett

Mark and Jim,
As part of pulling together Data Room for possible EBS sale, we are asked to come up with information regarding in-house developed software and labor cost. I would like to have your direction on the policy question whether to include Enfiber and Sabor Settlement systems.  Sabor Settlement system is using Unify Settlement as the foundation and Enfiber is patterned after EnPower which potentially could give some valuable competitive insight into our Trading.  Do you think these systems should be included in the EBS sales package?  As shown on the attachment, those systems are included at the present time.  Thank you.

"EGM Cash Collections Report","Sally- 
I made a mistake in saying that we would have the London report ready for your review today.  We are not currently keeping a cash collections report on the London cash receipts to the detail that we are here in Houston and, therefore, have not been able to determine the ""cash received"" percentages for the month of September.  However, Pamela Lebrane of Project Sunrise has said that a report containing the required information will be available and easily accessable as a download from SAP by the end of October.  As a backup, the London office has agreed to maintain a side spreadsheet for the month of October which will keep track of all invoices due during the month and the timeliness of cash received.  Either way, we will make certain to provide an EGM consolidated report for the month of October.  I do apologize for the inconvenience. 

Attached below is a revised version of our Houston report that we had provided on Friday.  I noticed that I had included invoices that were due in August as well.  A hard copy will be delivered to your office tomorrow.

Hey,

I tried not to bother you today. Spent today working on the EBS Q4 & 2002 Action Plan and the Cash Flow Forecast and generally catching up. I spoke with DiMichele & Racicot and also and got a general update. I guess things look pretty bleak.

Just one point - being that I'm 5,000 miles from home (UK) with family & kids in school - I'd obviously appreciate as much notice as possible on any implications for myself - I know that may be tough, given the pace of change around here - but bear it in mind if you can.

I would be happy to sit down and discuss any plans you may (or may not have) for me. I'm a big boy - and I realise how serious this situation is.

Thanks.

Barry.

I appreciate your point.  Apparently, there is not a distribution list which is separated by US vs. Europe, etc.  In the interest of time, we got the memo out.  I see no way to fully eliminate some degree of confusion.

"RE: SO2","Dear Sally,

From what I understand, the SO2 issue relates to how we price our curves (which is based on the last trade done) vs what the deal terms were in the Barclay's deal (which is calculated using a formula based on the Bloomberg & Air Daily price).  Risk believes that the marking the curves based on last Enron trades is a better way to mark the curve.  The discrepancy came when Barclay's tried to margin Enron based on Bloomberg prices (which was incorrect - it should have been the Bloomberg/Air Daily formula).

In the illiquid SO2 market it is hard to say what is the better methodology.  Risk has decided that keeping the curves marked against the last trade more accurately reflects market, but to ensure that credit knows what they will be margined against, Risk is going to send a file with the deal formula prices to Debbie each time Bloomberg quotes come out so she knows what the margining should be for the Barclays deal (I believe Bloomberg quotes SO2 weekly).

Since curve validation looks at both last trades and market prices, the difference in prices would be noted, but the curves would not be changed to the Bloomberg quotes. I've asked Michelle Bruce to send you the curve val to support this.

Regards

Shona

Bradford called last night - some problem with SO2 marks.  Bill thought that our curves were way off.  Sounds as if that is not the problem but instead that the book in which these deals were put had previously housed only intercompany deals and not third party deals.  Book wasn't picked up in Credit's exposure, making it look as if we were off on our mark versus Barclay's mark by $20MM.  I have gotten one story from Brent.  What do you know about this?  --Sally

Subject:	EES Projects

Wes and Wade,

Rick Buy and the RAC/EES team have compiled a list of EES projects, the so-called ""Points of Light"" list. Its objectives are the following:

	- articulate the progress of EES initiatives to the BOD
	- ensure that important activities are not overlooked
	- assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals
	- monitor completion of projects against a set timetable

I suggest that we revise this list to reflect reality better. Also, you could use this list as a management tool to ensure that in six months EES issues are properly addressed.

I could meet with you and walk you through the ""Points of Light"" list.

Vlady.

Subject:	Curve Validation

Last week, I spoke with Sally and asked her to kick off curve validations respective to all desks.  I emphasized that curve accuracy is particularly important.  Although probabilities exist that Dynegy will mark book down, I think it would be wise that this process not be a deal buster.  Do you want me to communicate this to desk heads?

"Status of monday's payment proposal runs","Andrew, etal 
 
I wanted to provide an update on what people should expect on monday in respect to payment proposals.  We initiated test files on Thursday & Friday, to validate the distribution list and allow the BU Approvers & Delegates to get a feel for the data  We experienced some email address issues that have been corrected.  There are some additional names that were provided late Friday that will be added on Monday.  If your name was added by Andrew on Friday, you will not receive the files until Tuesday.
 
Expect data by Company type.  
 
Non-dip companies - Reports will include all unpaid open items that have not been blocked for payment.  You should be marking the items that you DO NOT WANT to pay in the file & forwarding it to George Wasaff.  We will only release the items authorized by the BU & the cash committee.   
 
 
Dip Companies - We will not be running a proposal for the DIP companies on Monday.  We are still working with the BU's to ensure that they have properly blocked the pre-petition open items posted to the commodity vendors before sending the proposals for approval.  We expect to finalize this on Monday so we can start the process on Tuesday.  It is imperative that this activity be completed before initiating this daily process.  When we run these on Tuesday, I would not really expect that many items.  We have not begun to process the post-petiton non-trade invoices.  We have been working to establish a process for segregating these invoices as well and have blocked posting of December activity until everyone was ready.  We expect to open up December on Monday.  
 
I feel very confident that we will be ready to initiate this process for the Dip Companies on Tuesday.  If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call at 5-5301 or drop me email.
 
Thanks
Sheila

Subject:	FW: Accrual Books


An update, 

As you know, as a result of someone in the coal group officializing accrual books in ""error"", we discovered third party credit exposures which were not being reported 
because accrual books do not get officialized.  The books COAL-ACCRUAL-BAS AND COAL-ACCRUAL-PRC held transactions with Sempra Energy with MTM values in excess of $88 million dollars ( a physical and financial transaction).  

As a result of this finding, I have asked each of the groups below to provide information re their accrual and affiliate books.  Based on my understanding, accrual books are used primarily for transactions which qualify as hedges, and therefore follow hedge accounting vs. MTM accounting.  There may still be some instances where these books are used because the transaction can not be accounted for via MTM, and it is not considered a hedge.  However, all 3rd party credit exposures in accrual books should be monitored for aggregate credit exposure, margin requirements, etc, but excluded for the credit reserve calculation.  

As I get responses from each of the groups,  I hope to be able to quantify the magnitude of this issue and work with GRMO and Debbie to determine the best way to immediately start monitoring these 3rd party exposures.  

Thanks,
Wanda

Can you please let me know the following as it relates to accrual books:

	Number of Books
	Do any of them contain 3rd party transactions?
	Are these transactions physical or financial or both?
	Are these books routinely officialized?
	Can you determine if these books are excluded from the VAR portfolio?
	Are these books included for CreditAg?

I need this information ASAP in order to access whether they contain credit exposures with 3rd parties which is not currently reported to credit on a daily basis. 

I would like to also gain an understanding re any other books that may not be officialized on a daily basis.  How are affiliate books handled?   Do any of these books contain positions with non-wholly owned affiliates.   

Please let me know by return e-mail your estimate of time to complete.

Thanks,

Sorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  

Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting required a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with you at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen.  

How are your 5:00 pm meetings?  

I will catch up tomorrow.  --Sally

"Enron Nordic","
I have heard through several sources that AEP has purchased the Enron Nordic team in Oslo.  This creates several issues that we must address:

Did AEP purchase any systems and/or contracts?
Are these employees still located in our office and if so are they assuming the building lease and associated expenses?
Do they still have access to our systems?
Who, if anyone, was not included in the AEP purchase?
Many of the deals were executed under ECTRIC - Nordic Branch; is this treated similar to ECTRIC?
Since ECTRIC still has not declared bankruptcy, we need to evaluate these portfolios immediately.
We probably do not have Commercial leadership in Oslo; therefore, we need to develop an action plan for that office.  

I believe that there were only Power and Weather transactions managed by Thor Lien in the Oslo office.

"Credit Reserve","There seems to be some confusion around which DPR captures credit reserve and consumption premium reserves and which balance sheet these items fall on.  
My understanding in talking with both Don and Kevin is that since EES is, on a go-forward basis, being granted origination (which would be the residual after all reserves are applied) that all prudency/reserve items will rest on the WhEES DPR.  The EES DPR will be just a single line net origination number.  We do need to capture the activity related to DSM in the EES DPR (including some portion of credit reserve and drift) but until we have the system capability to capture this it may just have to be part of the whole WhEES bucket.  This tracks with the idea that all future exposures (be they be wholesale price movement, tariff movement, credit exposure, etc.) be borne by EWS.  If so, they need the reserves to properly offset any realized activity.

The balance sheet reserves associated with these items already rest in the ledgers that are rolling up underneath EWS now.  Reflecting the positions on the WhEES DPR will make them consistent with how we are capturing them from an accounting perspective.

If anyone disagrees with this treatment, please respond to all the parties above so we can resolve this issue.  If there are no objections I would recommend moving the credit reserve over at the next possible point.

Wade

P.S.  This thinking only reflects how things are currently contemplated, if the mix around what is with EWS vs. EES (i.e., accounts receivable) we may want to rethink the credit reserve portion.

1/15 - 
curve val: we have scoped the curve val project and have discussed it with PwC.  I've talked to E&Y in general terms and have a meeting with them on this at 10 today.  We have also had initial discussions with the different risk groups about the holes in the curve construction & upload process and our deliverable for the end of today is a list of where the holes are and a plan to fill those holes.

We spent significant time with E&Y to go over the  make up of the DPR.  

We are working with the different groups on the 12/31 DPR information.  So far, we have only had one request for it.  My gut feeling is that EIM & ENA are complete, but ECTRIC & EGM need a bit more time.  Chris should have a complete status ready for today.

Our systems are fixed (hooray!).  Yesterday we caught up on the Enovate and Bridgeline DPRs as well as spent significant time with IT to get the systems fixed.

Susie is still working on the SEC VAR for 10/31, 11/30, and will start 12/31 as soon as all of the information is available.  She has also started the net assets work.

Lastly, the whole group had CAS training so once we get access to the system we can start pulling info by counterparty.


Today our goals are:

Curve val - finalize memo (getting agreement from PwC, E&Y, and Enron estate), put listing of curve construction plan fwd, start determining what the different buckets of curves are and what tools are available to perform analysis

Field more E&Y DPR qus

Have a complete status report on the 12/31 DPR.

Prepare ongoing reporting (Enovate, Bridgeline etc).

I also hope to get some time to familarize myself with the CAS environment.

We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operational risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.  

Thanks, 
Wanda Curry

good summary - we will make sure our risk guys understand what they need to do when setting up a new commodity

Subject:	Post Mortem on ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC

Problem:  
14 ERMS EGM books were not picked up in RisktRAC due to a mismatch of attributes between ERMS and RisktRAC.  

Root Cause: The over riding issue is that the current processes to keep RisktRAC up to date are so manual that the probability of errors such as this occuring are very high (point in fact - I had 1.5 people doing this last year and now have 4 + 2 managers to support + 1 director to support them).  Specifically, what occured in this case is:

Attribute mismatches happen frequently when there is more than one commodity per in the source system book.  When setting up new books, the book admin must indicate that there is more than one commodity in the book (or that the commodity identifier ie BRN has changed to BRNT) so Risk Analytics can set up the appropriate number of books (there is not a one to one ratio between ERMS books and RistRAC books).  In this case, these books were already being used for BRNT trades.  At the end of Aug/ early Sept these books also started being used for BRN and BRCM positions as well.  The additional usage for these books was not communicated to Risk Analytics therefore no additional books were set up in RisktRAC.  Additionally, there was no effective compensating control for Risk Analytics to catch this problem.

Procedures to ensure this doesn't happen again:
Short term
1) Training - training sessions for book admins to remind them of RisktRAC requirements- pilot class has been taught and first ""real"" class is Wednesday of this week.
2) Compensating control to be put in place - Risk Analytics is creating a role to review all exception reporting available on a daily basis (whether a book came from the source system but was not picked up by RisktRAC, whether a book was picked up but not included for VAR purposes etc).

Medium term
Greenlight - revamping benchmarks to pull from RMS (table where data is kept for RisktRAC) so the positions per ERMS can be easily reconciled to RisktRAC, other projects within RisktRAC being identified.

Long term
Strategic vision of RisktRAC (front end & all exception reporting needed) - user requirements being developed.

Wanda's QU's not answered above:
1) How long have these books not been in RisktRAC - Our best guess is end-August, early Sept when the books started to be used for several commodity types.
2) What is the impact on VAR?  -  The preliminary VAR for Thursday's trading was $12.928 million.  This export did not have the 14 books in it.  The final VAR for Thursday morning was $12.892 million. The final had about 10 of the 14 books - the other four hadn't yet been set up.  .2% - clearly immaterial
3) What was the volume missing?  300K barrels (per EGM).  - total positions were 5.3 mil BBL for Thursday's trading - approximatly 6% - a bit more material.

What's the story on this one?  Who can best answer the four questions posed by Wanda?  How soon can we have answers?  Interestingly, I have a 4:00 PM meeting today with Rick Buy, David Port, Wanda Curry, Bill Bradford and Debbie Brackett (rescheduled from last Friday re: Project Greenlight, due to Buy's schedule).  I would like to be more informed than they are at 4:00.  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

UK & Ireland: BP.L <http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BP.L&d=t>) has bid $25 million for a small portion of Enron Corp.'s (NYSE:ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) assets, mainly back office functions and information technology systems, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
Enron's full energy trading business is scheduled to be auctioned in a federal bankruptcy court on Jan. 10. 
``We're bidding for software, business processes, and license rights,'' the BP spokeswoman said. 
Once the world's leading energy trader, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, after questions around its financial dealings led to the company's collapse. 
BP may be interested in bidding for other Enron assets if the current auction process breaks down, the spokeswoman added.

"Enron Reward Bucks Modification","

Based on the suggestion made in Sally Beck's last staff meeting, we have modified the Enron Reward Bucks program to include the recognition of Managers. 

With regards to the process, you will continue to utilize the nomination form for Sr. Specialist and below and follow the same criteria. When ordering future debit cards, we recommend you include denominations of $150 and $200 to handle the additional recognition. In the interim, when nominating a Manager, you can combine denominations to equal the amount you are interested in rewarding (for example; 1-$100 and 1-$50 card or 2-$100 cards). We are not suggesting that you award at this amount, however it is available to use at your discretion.

The Enron Reward Bucks maximize at $200, where PBAs generally range from $200-$2000 though with committee approval can range higher. These programs are intended to compliment each other and we encourage you to utilize them to recognize and reward your team. We will continue to evaluate these programs and make changes as needed from both a business and employee perspective. 

Please feel free to contact your HR representative if you have further questions on the programs or recommendations on how they can be improved.

Please share this with your staff.


Regards
Frank

"Yellow Rose Petal award","
Hi Ladies, 
I hope the meeting on Saturday was interesting and  informative for you. Ginger was concerned that so many people left at noon when  it was supposed to last until 1 pm, but I think we pretty much covered  everything. 
 
In the notes I saw that it says ""Awards, Yellow  Rose Petal, 25 hours over the minimum. This is a new award."" I just want to  clarify that it is an award that our chapter asked for and is not a nation wide  award. If you want to have it, your chapter will have to request it from  National.

Subject:	Additional New Works; 5/2/01 Floor Meeting, 37th Floor

In order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid- and back- office functions, to decrease replication errors, and to increase communication standards; are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems, processes, and terminology of the various departments. Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).

The reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e. credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented. Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems. These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.

The ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight.

"RE: EGM Good Job!","Shona-
The officialization process that EGM - Global Products uses was developed when we were implementing our Global Risk Management Worldwide Close process.  We (at that point) had an excel speadsheet that would search ERMS by book codes and pull in the officialized post id for the day - if there was a blank, the book was not official at which point the book administrator then goes back into the ERMS database, officializes and then we run VAR and our daily reports.  We are now doing this via our Global Reporting database for Global Products.  In developing the process, it was myself, Scott Earnest, Mark Fondren and Simon Thurbin (London office).  We now have Bill Kazemervisz and Vera Ilyina who are running the database daily and making certain that all listed books have been officialized.  John Swinney is our Risk Manager of the Global Products team and he is involved making certain that the risk managers are updating our new books list so that we are certain to mark them official nightly as well as integrating any new processes relating to VAR, exotic file uploads, etc.  
As you can see, it is very much a team effort that has really paid off on ""next morning issues"" for our group.  
If you have any additional questions or comments, please call me.  
Thank you,

During the morning meeting today Rick Buy commented on what a good job EGM has done in the officialization process.  He took your names because he wanted to know who to thank for this.  His comments are based on the summary graph - his words - EGM has by far the most books but never shows up on the log - who can we thank for that?

Keep up the good work!

Subject:	Unify Gas Production Migration Schedule Changes

I wanted to send this letter to update everyone on the latest schedule for the Unify Gas migration to MS SQL Server.

As most of you are already aware, the migration date has been moved to June 8, with the new Unify Gas system being available for June 11 business. In light of this change, the following dates have been identified for key tasks:

May 10 - 11: Power Stage Server will undergo maintenance and configuration verification.
May 12 - 13: Power Production Server will undergo maintenance and configuration verification

May 13: Testing of newly configured Unify Power Production Server

May 18 - 19: Gas Dry Run#3 of the cut-over activities

May 24 - 31: Bid Week simulation on MS SQL Gas Production Server with Sybase

June 1 - 2: Gas Final Dry Run of cut-over activities

June 8 - 10: Gas Production cut-over to MS SQL Server

June 11: Unify Gas Go Live on MS SQL Server

There will be additional user performance tests scheduled as the need arises and with user management approval. Everyone will be informed of the dates and times as these tests are approved and scheduled. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Thanks,

"December Newsletter","Dear Nancy, Sally & Janet -

Did you have a wonderful Thanksgiving?  Ours was very nice; Mark's sister,
her husband and 2-year old daughter were here from California, and Mark's mom
& her husband came in from D.C. (but they stayed in a hotel!).  Luckily, our
aunt had the big dinner at her house - no trying to cook among the boxes!

Have you had an opportunity to review the December newsletter?  If so, please
let me know of any corrections or changes (Miranda gave me the corrected
minutes).  My plan is to drop it off to Sally Walker for copying first thing
Monday morning.  It will be crazy around here after noon Monday, and the
computer will be off for a few days (Monday night 'til Wednesday night or
Thursday) while we get set up in the new house . . .if the download didn't
work and you need a copy to proof, just let me know and I'll swing by with
one in the morning (our closing is not far from you, Nancy, so it won't be a
problem).

Thanks!  Robin

Subject:	RE: Reconciliation Across Risk Applications

This will require IT resources that support RisktRAC and source systems (ERMS, Enpower, London applications, etc.).  Jeff Gossett and I have had a kick off meeting with Steve Stock, who nicely enough has all of the necessary resources under his direction, with the exception of the London resources.  Steve is on board to make this happen.  All of this took place while Beth Perlman was on vaction, so I will get with her this week to inform her of the effort and to get her support as well.  

The project that Wanda refers to came about as a result of my meeting with Rick Buy a few weeks ago.  I suggested, and Rick heartily agreed, that we take ownership of a project to eliminate the disconnect between information in the sources systems (which Rick agreed is accurate) and information in RisktRAC (which is problematic due to the fact that when built, RisktRAC did not focus on how to get information completely, accurately, and efficiently from the source systems).  

Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the 60 to 90 day timeline.  We do not have a firm timeline established yet.  We have designated business and IT resources, and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved.  Steve Stock is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group, and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next 10 days.  We do anticipate a relatively short timeframe for results on this effort, but that is not yet defined.  

Look for another response to Wanda's memo which I will copy you and Rick Buy on that will give more context to what Wanda wants (which is an excercise to simply document yet again the fact that source system data and RisktRAC don't always match).  --Sally

Subject:	Reconciliation Across Risk Applications


Rick and Greg,

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from 
source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.  

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  
    
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:

1) the ability to track data ""accuracy"" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique ""failures"".  How complete is the data? 

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

Please call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda Curry

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

The EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.

I'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.

Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.

Guys, given our continued need to be crisp and clear on our work product and a clear view to increasing efficiencies, particularily in the back and mid office, I think it would be a good exercise to clearly map out roles and responsibilities between ENW and the EES Services Group in some amount of detail.  Dan will take the lead in this activity.  I would hope that we could have this mapped out fairly quickly without a great deal of internal time.

Thanks for all the hard work.

"Murray O'Neil's expenses","

George -

This note is to confirm that Murray O'Neil's latest expense report (roughly $2,000) was for valid,  POST-petition business.  He travels from Portland where he is based, to Houston, as needed, to work on Power settlements and volume management for EES, and these expenses are for airfare, hotel and meals for the week prior to the Christmas holiday.  Per our discussion, I assume that these were held up by the system due to the $5,000 limitation, for further review.

Please have a member of your team expedite the review of this expense report, so that it can be released today, if possible.  I assume that they will confirm to us that the report has been released so that Murray will no longer be behind in his expense reimbursements, since he will be traveling to Houston again (and therefore incurring expenses) on Monday.

I understand that Enron is not issuing cash advances, but that once the initial backlog of expense processing is done, that reimbursement will occur much more quickly, now that we are in the post-petition environment.

Thanks so much,

Beth

Subject:	Remaining Steps For Plan

Mark suggested that I document the major steps remaining in the Plan process.  It appears that most of the numbers are nearing final approval and Mark suggested that I document the major steps remaining in the plan process:

1. Finalize EGM and EA (Storey) Development project approvals.
[Kerry Roper]  EA projects Finalized. EGM & EIM are still changing today.  The changes of the last few days has also had an impact to other business units, especially EES as the development managers have changed some participation percentages.
2. Show EA IT Development projects for Energy Ops as flowing through Energy Ops' allocation to EA (Note: I am assuming this is only for EA).
[Kerry Roper]  Done
3. Finalize Headcount numbers based on IT Development changes.
[Kerry Roper]  Changes still being made.  Used estimated headcount for Development in the allocation process.
4. Get ""buy-off"" on other business unit headcount numbers used in allocation process (9:30 meeting on Wed.)
[Kerry Roper]  Done
5. Run infrastructure charge-back model using updated headcount numbers.
[Kerry Roper]  Done
6. Based on results of charge-back model, change depreciation, bonus and indirect allocations.
[Kerry Roper]  Done
7. Receive new EA allocations (which will be higher due to adding indirects.)
[Kerry Roper]  Not received yet.
8. Add new Corporate and EA allocations received to internal allocation process. (New Corp alloc. received 10/16).
[Kerry Roper]  Done using estimates for new charges from EA. These should be accurate based on infrastructure dollars sent to them.
9. Rerun internal allocations (indirects).
[Kerry Roper]  Done
10. Recalculate Enterprise Portal allocations to business units.
[Kerry Roper]  This task not needed.
11. Note: B. Richter indicated that the new allocation procedure might not be completed this week. I am assuming that we will keep the existing  budget allocation for the budget. (Will this work for EBS and ETS?).  I also assume we are final with other changes to Energy Ops and infrastructure.
12. Get approval for split of EES Retail and EES Wholesale.
13. Once all numbers are final, verify that all ENW team budget templates are updated and then saved to the intercompany billing file.
14. Re-create billing matrix and invoice file (6-8 hour process including review).
15. Produce income summary income statement by ENW team. (Use as check).
16. Resubmit all Corporate templates and reports (6-8 hour process).
17. Produce reports for Office of the Chair and prepare for Ken Lay presentation. 

These are the major steps in ""my world.""  I'm sure I am leaving some items out, but I think it gives you a feel for the steps we need to take.  Timing largely hinges on getting the final numbers completed and approved.

Subject:	RE: Team building event for my direct reports

Can you hold on this until after mid-week this week?  We haven't gotten much communication from ""above"" on spending, but everyone is doing the obvious things to be prudent right now.  I can tell you that even over this Thanksgiving weekend (with banks open on Friday), that there is still tremendous concern and focus on cash.  (I got calls at home on Friday afternoon to provide data on EA, EGM and EIM payables - data deemed critical that day).  I know that company-wide, we will want to be certain that the cancellation of the company-wide holiday party does not result in just as much money being spent by hundreds of groups across the company.  

If  waiting until after mid-week makes the timing diffcult for planning purposes, I might suggest a less costly version.  One idea is to tell your directs that you want to bring them together as a group to thank them for their hard work and offer your home for the occassion on the 7th.  You could submit for expense reimbursement the cost of something like wine and beer, and ask everyone to bring a snack to contribute to the party.  I think that everyone would understand not having the entire event underwritten by Enron - especially following the events that will occur  this week.  Over the years we have all gotten used to Enron footing the bill for so many things.  At the bank where I was before, we occassionally had get-togethers where we all brought something to the party.  It is not really unusual outside Enron.  --Sally

Subject:	Team building event for my direct reports



I have been sort of waiting to talk to you about having a small event for my direct reports to thank them for their efforts until things cooled down at the company overall, but -- I don't see that happening any time soon.

We have not really done anything at all this year, and I wanted to do an event similar to the one you had last summer for us.  They have worked so hard and we can't ever all get away from the office at the same time  -- even to have a lunch.

Was thinking about having them over to my house for drinks and then out to eat at a restraunt.  For my direct reports and spouses.  Will include both Global Services and EES.  Was thinking of Friday night after work Dec 7th.  Need to get planning if I get the go ahead.

I have a reasonably priced italian restraunt in mind, and it would be about 20 people.   Are you ok with that? And if so, would you and David want to come too?

Let me know your thoughts

Beth

Sally:

Thanks for the updates on today's meeting.

I've worked with Enron for a long time, in Power Settlements with Leslie Reeves, I've also worked with Kim Theriot in Liquids. 
Even thou I have no idea what will happen to our FX/IR settlements group, I was optimistic to hear that at least we will be considered
to new positions if these are available.

Thanks again for keeping us informed.

"NewCo"," Dear NewCo employees:
 
I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and next steps. 
 
What are those opportunities?  In short, to date no competitor has taken Enron's dominant market position.  In most cases, competitiors are retrenching from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to protect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets. Market liquidity and activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels.  This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less choices to manage key long-term risks. This lack of transparancy and liquidity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North American grid.   We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, which is unprecedented since the early nineties.  This coupled with market participants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many opportunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value. However, in the long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy and energy price volatility are highly likely. On the services side, there are numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron people have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible. I also believe that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to NewCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets. In short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has not been seen since the early nineties.
 
What is NewCo?  NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the energy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportunities detailed above.  These businesses will stretch from production to market, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in the United States and Canada. It will be a portfolio of several key businesses, services and assets supported by a common infrastructure.  It will be majority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensure liquidity and legitimacy. It will be re-branded and be operating and solvent by mid Q2 at the latest.  It will be seeded with a number of Enron assets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key credit support. Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately $500 million to one billion. With asset and new cash investment, NewCo should be at least a billion dollar company. It will emerge as a non-debtor company and should be an investment grade rated company. NewCo will employ approximately 100 to 200 people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under control.  These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in Enron and ex-employees. NewCo will have access to all Enron's existing systems and infrastructure. It will be in the market of buying and selling energy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the non-compete with Netco.I would expect that we would have a strong business and transactional relationship with Netco.
 
What will be NewCo's culture? It will have the benefits of being a small private company which will measure success by cashflow generation.  It will be a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other.  It will be a group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objectives.  It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily for long term value creation.  We will build an organization of integrity of which people can be proud. It will center its objectives around our customers and the satisfying un-met needs in the market.  NewCo will value customer relationships.  It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of open communication. NewCo will be innovative, agile and nimble.
 
What is next? There will be a meeting in 30C2 at 4:00 PM on Monday to discuss issues, questions and comments.  There will also be a dinner set up for 6:30PM on Tuesday at the Capital Grille to provide us an opportunity to spend additional social time to discuss NewCo. NewCo will be located on the 30th floor.  The immediate tasks in hand can be broken into the following: a) opportunity and business definiton including fully vetted business plans for opportunities identified around specific assets or independent of these assets; b) setting up infrastructure necessary to cure defaults and start performing to key operating assets including managing out of the bankruptcy; c) modelling cashflows, operating costs, capital requirements and proforma's for NewCo; d) working through the NewCo structure and path through bankruptcy to solvency, rating and operation; e) scouring Enron for other valuable assets not yet identified for NewCo; f) detailed market research;  g) asset acquisition target definition; h) financing and capitalization plan including raising external investment and i) additional hiring and recruitment.
 
On a final note, we will need to identify a new name for the company so let me know your ideas! I look forward to working with you towards reaching shared goals and celebrating the inevitable success.  
 
Respectfully,
Dave Delainey

Subject:	Status of sale of POPS to AEP

It looks like we are close to nailing down the license agreement for POPS with AEP.  There are no major issues with the license agreement.  They want us commit to assigning a resource for about two man months of work to help them bring up the application.  We would bill them $150/hour for this service in addition to the $1,750,000 for the license and source code.  If we can work out a schedule for half days at Enron and the other half at HPL then I think we have a deal.  -  Tommy

"RE: EES Weekly Status","I agree with her to some extent from an IT standpoint  -- we are having trouble getting Anthony to focus on some of the smaller issues when he is so focused on the Power and Genesys sytems, but he has been accommodating today

Need to update you on our offsite yesterday  -- and some good ""ah -ha's "" that Anthony finally had.  He is a hard IT person to work with (similar to Beth ) in that they think they know exactly what you do and what you need, and it is very hard to convince them of anything else.  We made some good progress yesterday.

Will update you on this RAC situation at our meeting this afternoon

RAC does not have all the facts here (not surprising) although we produce a pathetic little report around this which probably does not explain all of the facts

A 5000 backlog can crop up in a matter of 1 week

I will call Bill Bradford as soon as I have assembled all of the facts

Subject:	RE: EES Weekly Status

Bill

This problem is stemming from the volume in Mass Market as you know.  As a result, significantly more new transactions are being booked to ""New Counterpart""  than can be cleaned up from historical deals.  As Credit has been emphasizing for some months now, this is not acceptable for this business, is not maintainable (proof in the attached report) and IT resources are required to automate current manual processes.

Global Counterparty is testing their new process to automate the set up of new counterparts in GCP such that the GCP ID may also be returned to EES in conjunction with our credit response prior to booking (expected delivery next Monday0.   However, the risk system batch process specifically for RPS must be enhanced to automatically create the counterpart and accept the GCP ID.  Efforts are finally underway to this end and are expected to be tested within the week.  Then, downstream processing through to billing may benefit.

Many lack the clear understanding that it has taken not only GCP to set up the counterpart in Global Counterpart but also Deal Capture to establish and map the counterpart in RPS and RGS (both have been manual procesess, the latter severly under resourced).  

Once this is implemented, EES has over 20,000 Mass Market transactions executed now, so efforts need to continue to clean up this backlog.  More importantly, three companies have already filed bankruptcy.  We must complete these efforts to manage the portfolio and respond to these events.

Regards
Molly

"NETCO access to RisktRAC","Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.  In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).  With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.  I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.  Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).  As such, I recommend the following: 

In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.

How does that sound?

Thanks

"IT & Back Office Service Agreements","Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the estate's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment once a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Services agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enron for everything from email, internet, network services and office applications as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are concerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastructure in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA system and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal was to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and suggest that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information from one system to another until they have put in their own integration between the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put together a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

Subject:	Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary



Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other. 
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional permutations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degree. 
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts. 
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point). 
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Estate and New Co. 
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production. 
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conversion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integration Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility. 
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co conversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical path for New Co. 


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and financial on Jan 20. 
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support AEP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we're in synch. 
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single license of Unify. 
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for counterparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks. 
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading. 
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline considerations. The time window will be very small. 


Core Conversion Team  
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen
6) Ken Harmon
7) John Warner
8) Bob Ward

3) Due 12/20. Identify list of core systems for test purposes. Identify key IT owner and key business owner and respresentative for integration test. Owner: Iain Greig. 
4) Due 12/21. Define integration test workplan for integration test planning and execution for both Estate and New Co. Owner: Jeff Johnson
5) Ongoing. Participation in daily program management coordination meeting at 8:30. Owners: Jeff Johnson, Iain Greig, Aftab Saleem. 
6) Due 12/21. Organize meeting with key users and IT contacts to communciate foundation assumptions, context, team and approach for integration test. Develop first cut at sample trade transaction set. Owner: Iain Greig / Aftab Saleem. 
7) Completed. Contact Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Bob Superty, Brice Baxter to communicate above and set up meeting to begin planning with them on the integration testing process. Owner: Jeff Johnson

"RE: IT Support","When we reduced staff the first week of December, one of the assumptions we made was that we would not longer provide 24 hour support.   In doing so, the 7x24 team was let go.  That team represented about 50 people across my organization.  We have electronic monitor systems to ensure critical servers/routers/software/etc are running and if something goes wrong, someone is paged.  However, we are not requiring the help desk people to be on call.  (There are only 7 of them). And given all the data requests, churns, inventorying, etc, my staff is being stretched thin.  Also, we have had three resignations this week, so I expect it to only get worse.  
 
I will have someone (LaMetrice) get with Tammy to see what issues she has experienced to determine the criticality/type.  Possibly there are proactive things that can be done to eliminate her issue(s).  And if it's deemed that there is a need to have help desk staff on call, we'll figure out what that will take (cost).    
 
More to come....JR

Bob, 

We all realize these are difficult times and we must all adjust and work together but I would like to make you aware of the recent support changes that pose some issues for Logistics.  We are told that the Solution Center is not available after 7:00 p.m.  Monday through Friday nor are they available on the weekend.  We are continuing to schedule gas in Logistics albeit on a limited basis during these after hours so is there anyway IT can manage to provide some level of support?

We appreciate your efforts to work with us to develop a solution.  

Regards,

Subject: NetCo Issues and bids


We just had a very detailed, productive discussion with one of the bidders on the technical issues associated with transition around all technology.  Jay Webb, Anne Koehler and Bob McAuliffe and the bidder reps are going to try to finalize the discussions we had tonight in to a mutually agreeable transition services agreement.  We will, day one, have the list of IT assets (people, application hardware, Enron developed software) that will transfer.  We will need to finalize Jay's issue around NetCo contract employees related to 3rd party software until we can get that separated.  That will leave the service issues to network and data center.
 
We didn't discuss this in the call with the bidder reps, but if the IP stays with the estate and a license goes to NetCo, the estate can't and won't write NetCo a 2 year call option on the IP so that they have 2 years to decide to call it away.  Take a license and move on and leave Enron the IP.
 
What we did not discuss was what each party can use systems for, etc.  Both the above bidder and the other bidder have put in proposals that would restrict Enron from using the systems or applications for, in my opinion, any use in gas and power in North America, physical or financial, for any trading, market making, origination, marketing, etc. except for Unwinding Activities and in one bid, pipeline business as well.
 
The estate or Enron would like the ability to use the applications and systems not only for the management or unwinding of positions and supporting the pipelines but would also need them for the NewCo or energy business that can grow out of some of the remains in the estate and the ability to sub license the mid and back office applications to a 3rd party that would not compete in trading or marketing, but would use them to build a service company around them that would service gas and power companies in North America.
 
Your thoughts?

Subject:	IT & Back Office Service Agreements

Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the estate's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment once a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Services agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enron for everything from email, internet, network services and office applications as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are concerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastructure in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA system and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal was to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and suggest that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information from one system to another until they have put in their own integration between the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put together a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

Subject:	Integration Test Planning / Coordination Mtg Summary



Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other. 
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional permutations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degree. 
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts. 
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point). 
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Estate and New Co. 
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production. 
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conversion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integration Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility. 
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co conversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical path for New Co. 


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and financial on Jan 20. 
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support AEP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we're in synch. 
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single license of Unify. 
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for counterparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks. 
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading. 
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline considerations. The time window will be very small. 


Core Conversion Team  
1) Steve Stock - Applications
2) Bob McAuliffe - Infrastructure
3) Ziyong Wei
4) Steve Nat
5) Dave Nommensen
6) Ken Harmon
7) John Warner
8) Bob Ward

Subject: Unify Status Report


Summary of Bid-Week Performance

On Monday, October 29 we experienced heavy system activity and significant performance problems in the morning.  We were unable to fail-over, but we restarted SQL Server.  Performance improved slightly. 
On Tuesday, October 30 we again experienced heavy usage and significant performance problems.  We then re-started the standby server, and failed over.  Overall reliability improved greatly, as the number of user calls related to performance issues dropped. 
Since the October 30 failover, we've experienced moderate to heavy system usage with just a few user calls related to performance.  We have not failed over nor restarted SQL Server since October 30.

Operational Improvement Initiatives

It is very clear that current system performance and reliability is not meeting our expectations during heavy usage times.  A Performance Improvement Team has been established to formally review the entire Unify system to identify the top performance offenders.  To date the team has developed a methodology for identifying problematic procedures and tested that methodology to ensure metrics gathering won't impact production performance.  Moving forward, the team will: 

Begin metrics gathering from our production systems Monday, Nov 12th. 
Analyze results and prioritize performance improvement opportunities beginning Monday, Nov 19th. 
Begin analyzing, tuning, and testing our biggest resource-consuming procedures on Monday, Nov 26th. 
Deploy changes to production by December 14th.

In parallel with our efforts to optimize existing code, we will also be testing a new firmware version.  Firmware governs processor and memory configuration on our servers.  We believe that with Plateau 8.1 (the latest version of firmware for our database servers), we can realize performance gains.  We will complete testing of Plateau 8.1 by late November/early December, and schedule the migration at that point. 
The dreaded ""buffer latch"" bug seems to have been eradicated as of October 19.  Although we have encountered a second order problem with the fix provided by Microsoft, we are able to work around that problem.  
We have implemented new fail-over procedures whereby we restart our database server (the one which was experiencing problems) every time we fail-over.  This does not impact our turnaround times, and will ensure that every time we fail over, we're moving to a freshly-restarted database server. 
We have implemented new database maintenance procedures which will reduce the liklihood of experiencing an index corruption, as we experienced on October 19th. 

Enhancement/Bug Fix Initiatives

Team Leads have initiated regular meetings to review open work items.  Our plan is to meet bi-weekly to discuss progress, current priorities and new change requests.  
We have added an ""on hold"" status to our SIR database.  Putting an item on hold should be an explicit decision agreed upon by IT and business users.  This new status will help ensure we're on the same page when priorities change and items are put on hold.   
Attached is a spreadsheet of our ""Top 10"" by business area.  This list includes our major open items by priority, and includes bug fixes, enhancements, and some specific operational initiatives as well.

RE: Media Preparedness Session, June 12, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Doubletree Hotel, Lamar Room (downtown)

Team 

You may be wondering what our Media Preparedness Session on June 12 is about.  Here's the logic...   
We are in the enviable position of having significant media interest in the genius behind EnronOnline and our mid/back office services while, at the same time, we are trying to leverage our e-commerce reputation at Net Works.  We can use this to our commercial advantage, e.g. advertising without the expense.  Dealing with the media, however, can be like getting behind the wheel of a race car with no training -- you might have fun for a while but eventually crash.  That's why it's important that we set aside some time to get ready for the race.

We have hired The Ammerman Experience, a Houston-based media consultant, to facilitate the session, which includes interactive exercises in dealing with reporters.  I think you will find it rewarding not only in terms of helping your business, but for your own executive development.  Bring your best ideas for how to position Net Works for a big second half.

I hope we can have some fun with this.

Greg Piper

"Goodwill Update","The following is an update of the last two meetings of the FASB and decisions made regarding goodwill and intangible assets:

The Board reiterated that they intend to release the statement in final form in June 2001 despite publicity to the contrary.

The Board decided that goodwill should be tested for impairment annually rather than on an events-and-circumstances basis as previously proposed.  Additionally, goodwill should be tested for impairment during interim periods if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its book value.  It should also be tested for impairment on an interim basis when (1) a more-likely-than-not expectation exists that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, or (2) a significant asset group within a reporting unit is tested for recoverability under SFAS 121.

The Board changed the proposed method for determining the amount of goodwill to be included in the net assets to be disposed of.  Under the new method, a portion of the reporting unit's goodwill will be allocated to all divestitures.  I do not believe that the Board gave full consideration to all of the issues surrounding this decision.  In particular, they did not address application to divestitures that result in a loss prior to or as a result of goodwill allocation and disposals of equity, cost or fair value method investments.  additionally, the calculation itself is arbitrary and onerous in that fair values of the reporting unit and its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities will have to be determined each time a divestiture is done.  I will be consulting with AA on this to see if they can encourage the Board to give thought to these issues prior to releasing the final statement since they do not intend to discuss the issue further at this time.

The Board changed the proposed method of allocating goodwill upon an acquisition to allow for allocation of goodwill in an acquisition to a reporting unit even if none of the assets or liabilities of the acquired company have been allocated to that reporting unit.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions on the latest developments.  Thanks.

Subject: FW: Services Company


As many of you are aware, we have been kicking around an idea relating to a services company that would perform middle/back office services to the energy industry.  This was being considered for the following reasons...
 
1. Reduce expenses to the estate and Newco
2. Revenue opportunities relating to licensing software
3. Career opportunities for estate staff (retention)
 
The memo to Jeff McMahon below outlines the opportunity.  This has been discussed for the past 3 months.  We are currently engaged in discussions with Accenture.  They are the only service provider who could perform the outsourcing and provide the channel for a service bureau type company.
 
It has come to my attention that there may be limitations in the UBS deal that preclude the estate from performing in the capacity of a service company in the areas of gas and power trading.   My questions are (1) what is the interpretation because there seems to be conflicting in the master and sub license agreements? (2) what was actually agreed upon? and (3) if the answer is not favorable, is there an opportunity to negotiate? disagree? argue?
 
Greg Piper and I have been working on this and he may have contacted you concerning these points.  I'm not sure how to proceed, but I do need  to know what I can and cannot do with Accenture.  Jeff Golden and I spoke yesterday and Jeff thought that if the processing areas that I am concerned about do not constitute a majority of the cost of the operation - that it may be OK.
 
Thank you for taking the time to assist.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Great work!!  Absolutely proceed to the next level.  Please check with Mark Muller re any potential non compete on this...I am certain, though, there will not be one.  In fact, Netco could be our biggest customer!  Proably need someone from corp devt involved once you bring in the the consulting firm.  I would suggest that the reorganized Enron could provide these services to Netco, the Estate, the consulting firm, etc.

Subject: Services Company 



Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one of our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured into Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that there could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during November and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people), but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enron that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to ""win again"" as Enron.  

Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could provide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  With the potential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron employees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this ""independent"" services company to provide services.  Servicing the Enron Estate could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon the structure of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced costs for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true career opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained.  

Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.  We asked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, and I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this.  Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our hope would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted.  

The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consideration.  Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  It would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal.  If we as Enron felt that there is merit to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Creditor's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting firm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process.  

Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --Sally

It looks like we are close to nailing down the license agreement for POPS with AEP.  There are no major issues with the license agreement.  They want us commit to assigning a resource for about two man months of work to help them bring up the application.  We would bill them $150/hour for this service in addition to the $1,750,000 for the license and source code.  If we can work out a schedule for half days at Enron and the other half at HPL then I think we have a deal.  -  Tommy

"Suggestions to help short term morale","Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting.  

Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but how about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there. 

Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting. Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it. 

Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed. We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more. 

I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal and regular. 

Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted.

This move just gives me a little concern.  I was able to ask for another person
to be looking at volume management that Matt currently has, and now he has
settlements also.  This appears to be a lot.  We have a long list of items both
bugs and enhancements coming once we are out of code freeze for all three parts.

Let's talk about this next week.

"Membership rewards announcement - Pls distribute 1/18/02","AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

"FW: Budget Update and  Research project","
FYI below from Webb on the project with Webb and Vince Kaminski (EOL trade data).

Also, on 2002 budget, we agreed with EA OTC (Louise) yesterday on their total ENW budget for 2002 broken out into EnronOnline, Operations, Systems Development and IT Infrastructure for both expense and capital with Systems Development broken in to two portions, one supported by operations and one supported by gas and power commercial.  We will work with EA, EGM, EIM, and EEL next week to see if we can get them to accept a pricing structure for EOL that is more service and transaction based.  Brad is working with Louise, Sheriff and Shankman on this and our goal is to get something structured in this manner.

We also plan to get the EIM and EGM OTCs to agree to their complete budgets early next week.  ENW also has a meeting with the EES OTC on their ENW budget next week.

Due to all these numbers moving around so much (mostly down) and in an effort to keep Kerry Roper, Sally Beck and Pickering  focused on making progress with the business units, I am going to wait until next Tuesday or Wednesday to have a new ENW 2002 packet sent to you if that is OK.  Since we met with you on the total ENW budget on October 15th, EA alone went down $6 million in expense and $31 million in capital. We are making good progress down on EIM and EGM as well.  EES might be a different story. 

When you get that packet, you will see 2001 forecast vs. 2002 plan on the date we met you (October 15th) vs. where we are on October 22nd for 2002 Plan.  You will also have the total IT depreciation across EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EEL, ENW, EBS.  This is slowly trickling in but we feel good that we can get it right.

Please e-mail me back if you need anything sooner or if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks.

Hi Greg,

We created the database for them and gave them access a couple of weeks ago.  Last week, we created a tool for them to make it easier to mine the data and get subsets of data into Excel.   This afternoon we're releasing software that will keep this database updated in real-time.  That is going to be great; we may even consider switching all reporting to this database.  Finally, I extended an offer to a guy yesterday to be our full-time representative on this project. 

Next steps:
   1. create a schema for capturing price tick data.
   2. begin capturing price tick data in real-time on some EOL products.
   3. begin capturing external feeds like Nymex, FX, treasuries, stock quotes.

Hi Rick,
I'm in the process of planning the U.T. 2001 Fourth Year PPA Fall Lyceum series scheduled for every Wednesday in the fall.  As you know, this series brings to campus distinguished practitioners who address our 4th Year PPAs (the equivalent of college seniors) on current issues in accounting and current trends in business.  Last year, you delivered a presentation in this Lyceum on ""Global Equity Markets.""
I'd like to invite you back this year to make a presentation on Wednesday, September 12, from 4:00 to 5:15 p.m. (new time) in UTC 2.102A.   This presentation would be in addition to the Enron company presentation scheduled for Monday, September 10 at the same time and place.  Please let me know (1) if the Wednesday date is convenient for you, and (2) the topic you would like to discuss.  Also let me know if I can facilitate your presentation in any way.
Best wishes,

Please find attached the main model assumptions as discussed yesterday. I have not included the IT Hardware and Software assumptions since we need to come up with a new set of numbers based on real expenditures. 

I am also attaching a table that Fred forwarded me with a more accurate counterparty count (including the breakdown by type). This includes the total companies for the North American Market and we need to determine the targeting criteria within each group. This number should allows us to obtain a better estimate of the total market size.

It'll be great if you can take a look and let me know what makes sense, what doesn't, what do you think is missing, etc. I can be reached at extension 54658.

Thanks!

Sergio

"Energy Power Risk Management Conference - 2001","Sally,

I was scanning the brochure for the referenced conference, and noticed that Operational Risk is being addressed by an Enron Corp. employee, Kevin Kindall.  I tried to locate him on our People finder, but could not locate him.  I was just curious if you know who he is?  The brochure lists him as a manager. 

Although I can not attend due to the Impact & Influence conference, it is the type of conference I would love to attend in the future.

"Today's meeting","Thanks for the meeting today.

A couple of takeaways would be the following:

1.  Stop for a moment and look at where you are today with mid/back office systems and people related to your transaction counts and physical vs. financial.  Remember, volume doesn't matter.  It is how many transactions, how many schedules, how many invoices, etc.  Even plain vanilla deals get a paper confirm and get entered into systems.  Second, where are you going to be in 3 to 5 years and what will it cost to hire and build that machine.  I know you will have more power plants and physical reserves than Enron, but we process massive amounts of transactions that are related to physical flows, assets and positions, including all of EES' resource to load and customers.  We also do significant volumes of options as well as plain vanilla.  Remember, even though EnronOnline shows alot of ""vanilla"" stuff, our voice transaction counts have gone way up as well and we haven't decreased the amount of highly structured derivatives we have in the system.

2.  What functions are proprietary vs. what is something that you would be willing to let go.  The questions we ask ourselves are if it is core or are we best in class.  If things are not proprietary and you are not the best at it, maybe you should consider outsourcing.

3.  We can get a team from our Calgary office to your E&P purchase any day you want to start reviewing that processing deal.  

4.  Maybe we can get 4 guys and hit a baseball game.  Rumor has it we have great seats.

5.  Don't get hung up on the separate entity thing yet.  If it makes sense, it will happen.  Even if there was a separate entity today with security and some of your ownership, if it was processing your transactions, you would have outsourced to it so you still have to go through the outsource or not discussion anyway so you might as well do it first.

I thought it went real well.  You guys asked all the right questions and are clearly thinking about where to go.

Tell the family hello and call me when you get back week after next.

Here is the spreadsheet as it stands now (draft version, infact I'm still working to ensure all the formulas are working correctly).  FYI - The final version will only show the total balances column & the P&L columns as some groups netted these items and others did not.  Please review your items making sure they:

- tie to the GL
- include all commodities within wholesale
- are consistent from commodity to commodity
- if you have any questions about something in your balance sheet that you believe should be on this schedule please call me to discuss.

Also, I'm still missing ENA, EGM weather & global risk markets, and ECTRIC stuff.  Lastly, there are several reconciling items for ENA net assets I need to talk to someone about to determine whether they should be included or excluded from this schedule (Elaine, would you have time tomorrow am?).

Thanks for all your hard work.

"ENW EBS IT - Weekly Status Report  (as of 10/26/01)","

ENW EBS IT -  Weekly Status Report  (as of 10/26/01)


Executive Summary :

EnFiber:   Real Estate Book requirements gathering and documentation is 100% complete; obtained all approvals; development is 25% complete.  User acceptance testing for Scheduling Phase 1 is 85% complete; the implementation date has been changed to 10/26 per user's request.  Waiting for final signoff from Jim Terrell. Successfully implemented FACT Release 1.2 on 10/15.  Completed development of IP and Local Loop options for Valuation and began QA testing.  

PPCS/TRPS: 
TRP demo by Dorado is well accepted by Enron audience. The prototype is able to fix the biggest problem in the current EBS bandwidth trading process -- not able to show the actual hardware inventory of network elements in order to make accurate port striping and cross connect. Through their auto hardware discovery device driver, switch inventory will be presented clearly to the users in a nice graphical layout, so provisioners don't have to spend huge amount of time to maintain various IT systems to gather the knowledge of bandwidth capacity allocation.  TRPS will gather information for both TDM and IP.
Settlements (Saber):  Users are approximately 50% complete with User Acceptance Testing.  Users were successful in posting first invoices to SAP with no errors.  A demo of the GUI for the Flash to Actuals reconciliation process is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 29.  Production Implementation will be mid-to-late November,  a couple weeks ahead of original schedule.    
Remedy:  Started discussions for release 2.0 of the EBS Change Management application.   Changes to include schedule maintenance notices and test & turnup.  These changes does not require mandatory approval. Added automatic reporting functionality to the EBS Trouble Ticketing system.  Continued web development on the MSN document routing and approval system.   Functionalities completed include submitting new request, approvals and comments.
Livelink thespotlight: is currently providing storage for 24606 documents. Currently work is in progress to incorporate Engineering and Operations documents into the system, as well as migrate the system into the Corp domain. Below is a more detailed description of this week's activities and next week's deliverables.
 EBS Application Infrastructure:  Provide oversight and project management activities of the EBS application infrastructure with ENW.

EBS Database Technologies:   Provide on-going production and development database support for both external and internal EBS database systems.

Utopia: The proof of concept was completed Sept. 21st. A demo has now been given to Rick Paiste, Inja Chun, Rick Fehl, Paul Racicot and Sue Klinke, all reactions were favorable. The next steps will be to refine the presentation and re-present to upper management for further approval. Al Nahas will be demoed the product next week. We have identified issues with several of the dBs and this would require additional work to correct these data problems between the systems, this will not be an insignificant task.

Voice Minutes Trading:  USTeleNet has agreed to accept Enron routing data via an automated exchange (XML format) as opposed to the current labor-intensive process..  This will require USTeleNet to develop an interface to their TMS system.  We are also working with Nortel to interface with their Nortel switch via software (i.e. API).  Nortel has a proprietary DMS 250/300 operating system which requires manual input every time a route is changed;  we will continue to investigate the feasibility of interfacing internally-developed software to improve efficiencies & accuracies.  Many suppliers' rates have been downloaded to our environment for purpose of finding least-cost supplier's rates for our traders and creation of rate sheets for confirmation.  New Product Management and Supplier Rate Management modules have been developed and are now being tested by users.  Trader Ratesheet development should be completed & available for testing within the week.     We have scheduled 11/8 & 11/9 for the 4tel / Telesciences software demo.      
Deal Prospects / Contact Tracking:  Reviewed options including existing solutions such as EnGAGE, Siebel (off-the-shelf) and an internally developed web-based tool.  Goal is to provide a simple, cost-effective tool that can be used by commercial teams (starting with Mid-Market, DRAM, Minutes ?) to track prospects & contacts.    
Enron  kicked off an enterprise-wide CRM initiative with the goal of recommending a CRM strategy (including Sales Force Automation) to senior Enron management by October 25.   EBS will only be participating in the assessment / evaluation stage. 
Media Services / Strata:  Developed a Tactical Deal Capture product ; in process of completing Sales Invoice functionality for Tactical Settlements, including the ability to generate Sales Invoices on the basis of Physical Spots, Survey-Based GRPs, Overnight-Based GRPs, or PreBill (prior to actual spot airing).  Tactical Deal + Settlements are integrated, using Strata core data coupled with Tactical Deal data.   Continued systematic daily processing of Nielsen Overnight TV & Cable Ratings data (nearly 100,000 lines/day), along with systematic aggregation of Quarter Hour data for each TV program.

Project Name: PPCS/TRPS

Accomplishment - this week 
?	Implement a new project plan to expedite the development effort of removing Xconnect from PPCS. 
?	Connectivity between Pleasanton switch lab and Enron Ardmore/Greenspoint is rebuilt. Lucent 2.5 G test switch now is reachable for acceptance test.
?	Identify a Lucent 10 G test switch in Portland for acceptance test.
?	Identify a Lucent 4608 switch can be used for acceptance test. Since the switch is also in production. Extreme caution will be measured for port assignment. Additional coordination with Global Network Management group is required..
?	Dorado provides TRP prototype demo for provisioning, capacity management, TOC, NOC, GNM and IT. The demo goes very well and receives high remarks from attendants.
?	Furnish additional requirement to Dorado for TRP development.
?	All switches are reachable from PPCS in the whole week.
?	Test contracts running on Portland lab do not collect PM successfully. Investigation is under way. (Eric Liu)
?	Implement a code check in/out process in a joint development environment without direct network connectivity

Deliverables Scheduled for next week  
Finish development to remove xconnect and disconnect from PPCS. 
Coordinate with network engineering, network security, provisioning groups and NOC to determine when PPCS network security setting will be upgraded again. 
Prepare db migration and production freeze.
 Enron continues to furnish up to date business requirement of PPCS replacement product to Dorado.
Coordinate with GNM to identify available port assignment in the San Jose production switch for acceptant test.
Dorado deliver Red Cell API documents to Enron.

Key Date 
Dorado delivers TRP prototype 1.0 date is 10-31-2001
Ardmore server goes into production date is 11-19-2001

Issue 
Need to work with GNM to reset network security for PPCS before 1.1.2 goes into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to make sure current PPCS 1.0 contract will not send out disconnect commands after the network security setting is upgraded and before 1.1.2 goes into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to implement and communicate the new operation procedure to filed engineer and provisioning. So physical cross connect from SNMS will occur before PPCS PM collection time and physical disconnect from SNMS will occur after PPCS stops collecting PM. (David Workman)
Follow up with Terry Hoop's to find out whether the Luent 2.5 G test switch will be available in Shepherd. (Eric Liu)
Dorado needs to provide a complete set of final source code of PPCS 1.1.2 to Enron. (Dorado)
PPCS access level has been downgraded to prevent cross and disconnect commands sent to the switches. Because of the change, PPCS stop collecting PM data for newly entered contracts 'cause PM initialization requires the same level of access right as cross & disconnect. So security level for PPCS needs to be upgraded before George Babaz's team can continue to enter missing contracts to the system. But the timing is very tricky otherwise there maybe a possibility some existing contracts on version 1.0 will be terminated by PPCS. (Eric Liu)
Dorado needs to start deliver TRP related documents to Enron. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to package PPCS 1.1.2 delivery CDs with all the fix. (Dorado)
Installation documents from Dorado needs to be further flushed out. (Dorado) 
Dorado needs to produce timeline and cost estimate for new requirement. (Dorado) 
Dorado needs to provide TRP architecture. (Dorado) 
Sylvix manager installation (Dorado and Rick Paiste) 
Hardware support for outages needs to defined (David Wicks) 
Final versions of 1.1.2 documents need to be updated in spotlight document management system (Eric Liu)

Project Name: Utopia 

Accomplishment - DB 
ECOMS has completed their view in Development and Production. Nothing more is needed of them at this time. 
ENFIBER has completed their view in Development and Production. Nothing more is needed of them at this time. 
IP ALLOC - A flat file is taken from Dennis Boylan (contains IP address ECOMS number) and put the data into an Oracle table in Utopia... The data will be static, but should be sufficient for the proof of concept. 
DEAL LAUNCH has now received their required for supplying the SLA information that is required for the central dB 
PPCS has to wait for the completion of their Oracle conversion top be able to supply their view in Development, this will be available sometime next week. 
IPN PROD some analysis still needs to be done to get the IPN PROD details into the UTOPIA schema 
FACILITIES has completed their view in Development (but it pulls in data from Production). Nothing more is needed of them at this time 
dB has now been created and tested on robin.enron.com 

Accomplishment - Application 
Firewall - The PO has been received by the vendor. The Greenspoint units should arrive at Enron by 09/20. 
Impact - The application has been configured on server jfkdev. 
Omnibus - The application has been configured on server jfkdev. 
Webtop - The application has been configured on server jfkdev. 
Clients - The client software has been loaded on all developer PCs. 

Deliverables Scheduled 
Continue to work with security and network engineering groups to finalize firewall diagram. 
Create examples to showcase what Utopia can accomplish. 

Key Dates 
Southern View consultants come to Enron to set up impact servers and train developers: 9-17-01 to 9-21-01 
Present POC to EBS management 9-24-01 to 9-30-01. 
Install Greenspoint firewall for IPsec tunnel 10-15-01 

Issue 
Network security - The possibility of an IPsec tunnel between the Greenspoint POP and the Ardmore DMZ has been revived. The tunnel is now dependant upon Mark Thibodeaux's approval of a revised EBS Change Management procedure. Ernest Hernandez is working to get the new CM process approved. 
SLA data will not be available in EnFiber. We will get any data that we can from Deal Launch (Nick Patel). Any remaining data will be added to the Oracle tables by hand. 
The Utopia developers have identified several bugs in the Impact v2.2 software. The bug list will be sent to Micromuse for immediate attention.

"Re: FW: SAP Cost Center Change/Request","All,

I have not yet gotten Don's employee information yet and am waiting until I can move everybody at one time so we have a clean cut-off for everyone.  If we have missed the May cut-off for an April 30 transition, we'll make it effective May 31.  Also, I am considering just making it effective June 30 so we have a clean quarter cut-off.  So, continue to use your current cost center until you hear back from me.

Also, Kerry, is the description of the cost centers standard (the ENW ENA)?  Will this be confusing to existing ENA descriptions?  Would it be better to call them ENA/EES or EWS/EES.

Thanks

Wade

"EGM Organization Update & Announcement","
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

A quick update on the status of the receivables monetization initiative. 

First, I have been told that we will go forward with the financing with or without any merger. That said, the banks are worried that we will change our minds and are asking for a formal engagement letter, which means we lost a few days negotiating the terms of the letter.  I don't expect any new requests for data until Tuesday at the earliest, and more likely Wednesday or Thursday of next week (as Monday is a bank holiday).

Thanks for you help, I'll let you know of any changes as they develop.  have a good weekend.

Subject: 2002 Budget for Enron Net Works



ENW submitted our preliminary revised budget two weeks ago.  In our meeting in the Board Room, we did acknowledge that the ENW budget is very dependent upon the business plans of the business units that we support.  Since our budget meeting was the first that you conducted, we agreed that the ENW revised 2002 budget would need to be reviewed again once the business plans and associated budgets for other Enron business units were completed.  Has that process been completed such that we can now re-evaluate the 2002 budget for ENW?  

I will follow up with you or someone on your staff on January 2 so that we can complete this budget process.  

I hope that you and your family enjoyed the holidays.  --Sally

"CHF Leadership Forum Actions Plans and Follow-up","
Hey Sally- 
This note got kicked back to me when I tried to send it to  you yesterday, so hopefully it will make it through this time.
Thank you for your wonderful letter explaining your  decision to stay and display ""visible leadership"" during this very difficult  period. I read an excerpt of it to the group, and everyone's hearts were with  you. You were greatly missed, but of course we all understood and supported your  decision.
It was wonderful meeting you and I thank you for your  wonderful contributions to the first session. I hope once things stabilize a bit  you'll have a chance to re-engage with the group. 
With all best wishes-
Margaret Vaughan
 
Hello everyone-
 
Congratulations on a great Forum. It was an immense  pleasure meeting and working with all of you over these last two months.  
 
Attached is a Word document containing the action plans  created in the second session in the 5 areas of Inclusion/Diversity, Quality of  Place, Education, Leadership and Business Retention. Betty Alexander will of  course be getting the complete report to you in a week and a half or so.  However, we wanted to give those of you who were not able to attend the second  session or had to leave early an opportunity right away to engage with the plans  that were generated -- someone from the group will be giving you a call in the  next week to go over these plans with you. 
 
In the meantime, please look over the attached  document and see where you might want to join in -- there is plenty of  room for volunteers in a number of areas. For instance, Gaurdie Banister and  Brian Landrum are looking for volunteers to help them move the  Inclusion/Diversity initiative forward, and opportunities abound in the area for  Education to aid with the Teacher Network (James Calaway: 713/627-1466) and the  Annenberg High School of the Future project (Jonathon Day:  713/225-7011). Also, Ron Lewis (713/229-1125) and Sally Jeffcoat  (713/756-5008) are looking for people passionate about enhancing  Houston's social services to join their working group at The  Center. 
 
To volunteer for any of the initiatives laid out in the action  plans, please contact Marilou and she will get you plugged in.
 
Again, it was a great pleasure and honor working with you, and  I look forward to following your efforts to bring forth a fantastic future  for Houston!
 
All the best-
 
Margaret Vaughan

"Payment Proposal Template structure","I have received several calls from you questioning the number of files that you are receiving from the payment proposal process that we are trying to put in place.  We did experience a technical problem on Tuesday and most of you received files from both the 17th & the 18th.  This problem has been addressed and we do not expect it to occur again.  However, I do want to provide you with some information to help each of you understand the number of files that you are getting as well as the data contained in each.   
 
Attached is a spreadsheet that has been put together to document the various payment proposals that are run for each business unit, what company codes are contained in each and who the proposals are being directed to.  
 
The first column on the worksheet titled ""Approval List"" documents the BU Proposal category.  For each BU the companies have been divided into Dip & Non-Dip as applicable.  This was necessary because the vendor selection criteria for each group is different and we did not want you to have to look at the Pre-petition Dip open items on a daily basis.  
 
The second column contains the SAP proposal names.  The importance of this column is that it documents the type of information contained in each run.  Company status (Dip/Non-dip), Business unit, & type of payment.  The following is a legend on how to read the proposal name. 
 
5-character group name (ABBBC)
A - Denotes Dip company
BBB - Business unit identifier
C - Type of payment job (E - Emergency check, C - Check/ACH, W - Wire transfer)
 
4-character group name (BBBC)
BBB - Business unit identifier
C - Type of Payment job  (E - Emergency check, C - Check/ACH, W - Wire transfer)
 
NOTE:  Not all companies have the ability to send payments via all methods.  Some companies may only be able to do 1 or 2.
 
The second worksheet in this file ""Template list"" contains a list of the company codes contained in each template.  This file does not list all company codes configured in SAP only those that have payment capabilities.  
 
The desired result of this process is to document the items contained in the file that you DO NOT want to be pay.  (The assumption on a going forward basis is that we would be paying most of the items contained in the files.)  Please denote these items by putting ""Do not pay"" in the first empty column to the right of the data provided.  Once you have reviewed each file, please save it and forward on to George Wasaff.  George will then take this information to the cash committee for approval.  When the Cash Committee completes their review, George will communicate back to the ISC the information, and we will execute the proposal for payment.  
 
I know that this is a very manual process and we are currently working with Andrew Parsons and others to automate, simplify and adjust the deadlines.  We will be communicating changes as they become available.

"RE: budget questions","Greg,
I have attached responses to these questions.  We can discuss them and decide how to best present them when we resend the entire package to Whalley.
 

-----Original Message-----

Subject: budget questions


Some things that jump out at me on the Whalley packet page labelled Global Support Dollars - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast Variance dated 10/23/01
 
Under EGM, increase of 5,573 in operations expense and increase of 16,159 in IT development expense.  Doesnt that sound like a big jump?
 
What made EIMs infrastructure go up 2,334?
 
How is energy operations for EES down 9,092?
 
What did EES spend capital on in 2001 to make the capital IT infrastructure variance be down 19,726?
 
What is going on at Corp. with a positive IT infrastructure variance of 13,924?
 
On the front page or Whalley summary page, why did depreciation go from 62,028 to 30,124 to 57,843.  I know some of what you said Kerry but we need to make sure that Enron knew the 2001 depreciation number in the 2001 plan and that 62,028 did get depreciated accurately and that it just so happened to turn out that only 30,124 got done on our books.
 
You get the point.  I think this is what Whalley will do too with the entire packet on all pages.  I know the numbers are right, they just beg alot of questions so make sure we have an updated, very accurate cheat sheet with all the explanations so when he gets the packet today, he can follow it!
 
I assume everything ties that should.
 
Thanks.

I know the message is 'business as usual' but with some changes inevitable down the line, I'm just checking for all the people 'in the pipeline' for moves from overseas.....is it still a 'go' ?  

Please keep me in the loop if you think there may be changes to current plans for Neil's move.

Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with Dean May and the three scholarship recipients.  One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to Dean May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from Dean May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.  

I have booked The Josephine House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!  You, Brent and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.  

Planned invitees from Enron are you, me, and Brent, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and Andrea Reed.  Roger Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.  

Others that we could include are Billy Lemmons, as AA program head, Ben Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and Christy Patrick from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though Karen Marshall on their staff last year planned the dinner).  

Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.  Lexi says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of ""more senior"" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like Beth Apollo, Randy Petersen, Hunter Shively, and Greg Piper.  Lexi has checked with Wes about interviewing - he can't do it.  She is waiting for calls back from Mike Deville and Mark Lindsey.  

Who would you like to include from Enron at the dinner from the names in bold above?  --Sally

I have put together a brief campus update, including all previous and future events for the fall recruiting season.  Changes to our original campus plan are noted on the attachment.  As you can see, I still need 3 interviewers for October 16th.

All of our events have been well-received on campus.  The presentations that we have given to various student organizations have been of great benefit to our recruiting effort.

Regarding our campus numbers, I intend for the following:
Full Time:
Round 1: interview 55 candidates
Round 2: interview 36 candidates
Super Saturday: invite 15 candidates
Target: hire 10 candidates

Interns:
Round 1: interview 14 candidates
Round 2: interview 8 candidates
Target: hire 5-6 interns

	Please let me know if you need anything else or if I can provide any additional information.

	Thank you!

"FW: ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC","
Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

Subject:	Havre Pipeline Outsourcing Update


Over the past several weeks we have had several meetings regarding Ocean's Havre Pipeline system.  We have met with Greg Nelson, the Ocean accountant who handles all the day to day and monthly settlement activities on the Havre Pipeline. In addition, we have had several internal meeting to discuss this potential opportunity.  Ocean was interested in possibly outsourcing the scheduling, balancing and other back office activities related to the Havre Pipeline.  Based upon these internal and external meetings the following concerns and/or issues were raised. 

According to ENN, with the sale of HPL, ENA no longer has the internal expertise to manage the daily logistics and monthly settlements associated with a small intrastate pipeline.   It is not a core part of ENA's back office functions.  Obviously, Enron's GPG has the expertise to operate large interstate pipelines.  I have contacted Brad Holmes to determine if GPG  has any interest in this type opportunity.
It was stated that ENA could perform the services, but since the required services are not core to our back office that it would not be efficient for  ENA to perform the services.  The tasks to manage, balance and account for the transactions on the Havre Pipeline currently consume only  25% to 50% of Greg Nelson's time.  It was thought that it cost more for ENA to provide the required services than for Ocean to continue to do it themselves.  
The proposed transaction made more sense when connected to an HMS wellhead automation project.  HMS bid on installing 300 EFMs which would have been a milestone project for HMS.  However, as a standalone outsourcing transaction it is not as attractive.
Outsourcing the back office functions on the Havre Pipeline is not high priority for Ocean.  It was more of a ""side bar"" to the wellhead automation project which has been postponed. 
           
 Given that the proposed transaction is not core to ENA's back office, is a very small transaction and does not integrate with another component of the Producer One program, I do not think ENA should pursue this transaction at this time.  GPG may desire to pursue the transaction.  However, based upon my preliminary discussions with Brad Holmes I do not think GPG is very interested.  If Ocean decides to go forward with their EFM project in the spring, I think ENA should review the potential transaction at that time.  

ENA future opportunities with Ocean should not be impacted by our decision not to pursue this transaction.  Ocean did not initially want to outsource the back office functions of the Havre Pipeline.  Ocean should respect ENA's honest evaluation of the situation.

If you have any questions please give me a call at ext 33541.

Thanks  ... Kevin

A man flying in a hot air balloon realised that he was lost. He reduced height and spotted a man below. He shouted down: 'Can you help me? I promised to meet my friend half an hour ago, but I don't know where I am.' The passer-by shouted 'You are in a hot air balloon hovering 30 feet above a field. The field is located at 40 to 41 degrees latitude and 59 to 60 degrees longitude'. The balloonist thought for a few moments and replied: 'You must work in risk management.' 'Remarkable,' said the passer-by. 'How did you work that out?' 'Well,' answered the balloonist, 'everything you've told me is undoubtedly correct. However, I haven't the slightest clue what to make of it and the fact is that I'm still lost.' The passer-by gave him a knowing look and replied: 'Why didn't you tell me you were a trader?' The balloonist looked amazed and said: ' How did you work that out?' 'Simple,' replied the passer-by. 'You don't know where you are or where you're going. You've made a promise that you've no idea how to keep and expected me to solve the problem. Having done as you asked, you're in exactly the same situation as you were before we met, but now, somehow, the whole thing's my fault.'

Sally - 

We would like to begin tracking & measuring volumes transacted and settled in the retail business - by commodity.

Can we discuss how to get our arms around this and when we can begin to see weekly, monthly, quarterly data?

"EDS Billing","We have surpassed the Enron 2001 minimum commitment spend of $8,000,000 with EDS.  We would not have met our commitment without being creative and asking EDS to purchase $5,000,000 worth of flat screens for use in Enron Center South.  In 2002 we once again have an $8,000,000 ""take or pay"" commitment.  Currently, we have approximately $3,000,000 worth of 2002 EDS utilization commitments from various Enron business units.  Which means we will need another $5,000,000 worth of creative EDS spend in 2002.  

After 2002 the Enron spend commitment to EDS is $5,000,000 per year with no set contract termination.  My understanding is that the way in which the original financing deal with EDS was booked deters us from ending our relationship with EDS.   

Please find the details attached.

Subject: Services Company 



Beth Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the Enron Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one of our business goals within Enron Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured into Enron's trading operations systems and processes, we believed that there could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during November and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people), but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed Enron that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to ""win again"" as Enron.  

Obviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could provide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  With the potential of spin-off companies from Enron and with former Enron employees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this ""independent"" services company to provide services.  Servicing the Enron Estate could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon the structure of the deal, benefits to the Enron Estate could be reduced costs for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true career opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained.  

Beth and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with Greg Piper today.  We asked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, and I believe that he has copied you on a note to Anne Koehler regarding this.  Our ability to process transactions is one of Enron's assets, and our hope would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted.  

The next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consideration.  Beth and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  It would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal.  If we as Enron felt that there is merit to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Creditor's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting firm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process.  

Your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --Sally

"RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep","Dear Sally,

After the meeting with Rick & Rick, Beth, David and I discussed how best to perform the 4Q 2001 London Doorsteps and have implemented the following:

- Before any doorstep takes place, the doorsteppers must work directly with EAS to determine what has been done in regards to control reviews.  To date, what we have obtained from London are the self assessments prepared by Operations and will receive copies of EAS/AA reports upon their completion (expected end-Nov).  

- Each doorstepping team has had a conference call with EAS to ensure the doorstep team fully understands what has been done to date around the trading controls and where possible issues lie. We are using the reports noted above as a background for these discussions.

- The doorstep teams are all planning to use AA/EAS's deal test results (the only exception to this is Essen, where we feel that additional sampling should be done).  

- With the exception of metals (recycling & London) & EOTT, RAC will take on a consulting only role.

- As far as the video conference idea was concerned we felt that if the doorstep team was willing to travel that would be the best way to perform the doorstep.  This is because we feel that there is really no substitute for being in the location to hear side comments, feel what morale is like etc.
 
Lastly, we have talked to EAS about adding some procedures on to the testing AA is performing, however, they feel they can not take on any additional work.  This is primarily because AA got a late start this year and is feeling challenged to complete their work.

 

Best regards

Shona

I know that in our meeting with Rick and Rick we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.  What happened to that effort?  Sounds as if from the London e-mails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world.

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

"FW: Revised Draft of the Assignment and License Agreement","Here is the document I mentioned that Lance Schuler is working on in NYC.  It may be presented already by the time you read this and I was only brought in to it late yesterday.  I think Louise might also be adding some changes as well.

Basically, it does have the estate assigning all Intellectual Property rights for software (EOL and other gas and power systems I assume) over to NetCo and has the estate take back an object code and source code license with full development rights in perpetuity that we can use for anything we want.  The one thing it restricts is our ability to sub license to a 3rd party in NA gas and power trading.

If NetCo fails or folds, we get all the assets back.

It also allows for a 60 day redirect so when NetCo gets their site up, (but not longer than 90 days after closing of agreement), if people type in EnronOnline.com, they will end up at NetCoOnline and that site will have a link back to EnronOnline.  After that time period, EnronOnline will only provide a link to NetCoOnline for another 120 days (Louise wants 250 days) and vica versa.  I asked that the location of the banner and link be mutually acceptable.

As long as we hold more than 20% of NetCo, they won't assign or license to a 3rd party or use it in certain commodities (non gas and power I assume).  NetCo can license it to affiliates so whatever bank buys them if they are an affiliate, they can all us it for trading things other than what we put on that restricted list, which is bracketed and empty in my version.

There is no reference as to whether the estate can trade gas and power in North America but it does not preclude us from using the software to do so.

Lot's of other stuff (we let them borrow the EnronOnline trademark for 6 months to market their site but they can use it only for the sole purpose of marketing wholesale gas and power trading in NA and they can't disparage our name).

As I said at the start, I am far from the person controlling this particular part of the entire deal but I did what I could to help the estate in this agreement.

Here's a pretty good article on Enron that was sent to all of EES.
It may not be a bad idea to send it to all of ENW.

A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.

Manager's Journal:
What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the
vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),
competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and
dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being
an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from
grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.

   Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron
became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor
of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles
drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements
were all a mirage.
   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under
investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts
of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the
law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve
themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an
enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.


   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and
electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open
market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to
enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.

   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,
and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have
been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough
deregulation.


   -- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the
old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were
offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system
was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you
can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that
could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.

   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its
constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,
and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's
investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by
inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph
Schumpeter called the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative
destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be
part of Enron's problem today.


   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended
the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper
company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper
plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run
all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.
Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with
inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of
""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisioned creating free markets for
components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market
terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The
development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions
of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the
economy.


   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated
environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a
single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could
be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to
the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of
alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling
switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules
or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,
and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This
policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value
for both customers and suppliers.


   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could
easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of
the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal
controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we
judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of
Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion
each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on
company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.

   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading
losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's
ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and
trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,
counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the
erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.


   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's
corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood
stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,
slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline
company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron
became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It
bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to
start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.

   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and
an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization
and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe
the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.
This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could
serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.

   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the
transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet
corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in
almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.

   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to
find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all
should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to
reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

It looks like we agree in principal but I'm not comfortable with some of the language proposed by AEP.  Since Barbara Gary is out until next Tuesday I don't anticipate us finishing up the agreement until the end of next week at the earliest.  Given the timing we need to be able to turn around and deliver the application & documentation by the end of November in order to receive all of the funds this year.   I will be setting up a meeting with the application, DBA, DA and technical writing teams to make sure we are all on the same page and ready to deliver the application by the end of November.   -  Tommy

Subject:	HPLC Imbalance File

Attached is the updated imbalance file showing net positions by counterparty.  You can expand the detail to see the contracts that make up each of those total counterparty numbers.  I have also color coded any companies that are doing business under several different companie/subsidiarys down at the bottom of the file to show their net position as well.  The numbers in this file represent what we currently have on our books as of 2/01 production, 3/01 accounting and we are still getting confirmations in from the customers on those imbalances where there is not anything in the  ""imbalance per customer column"".  Since the meeting, the Exxon King Ranch number has changed significantly and I will have someone look more closely into that and provide an update/explanation.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Causey concurs with postponing Doorstep reviews.  Haven't heard back from Buy, but I will find him in person this afternoon and will get back with you as soon as I do.  I agree - no need to prepare anything at this point while we are waiting for Buy's response.  --Sally

Sally,

As I sure you know Stacey and Kristin are due to be here next week and Stacey has asked me to pull together and send various pieces of information before they arrive.................... Is the review definitely happening next week (re your last paragraph) or do I not need to prepare the information etc because if it is then we need to get started ?

Subject:	RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep

In an October 3 update meeting with Rick Buy and Rick Causey on Doorstep reviews, both were very supportive of the efforts to date this year.  Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  

In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   

Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally

The EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.

I'm afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.

It's official, we are being door stepped. The Houston plan is to do all of Power and all of the Structures (although when I spoke to Stacey she seemed a little unsure of her plan for structures). Also from what Stacey said the Gas door step will be following shortly.

Stacey and Kristin Albrecht aim to be here for the whole week starting first thing on Monday the 5th. EAS here are already in the loop as they have been various conversations. Obviously with all the additional work we are being asked to do at the moment something will have to give. I aim to speak to Paul Bromley to agree whether the EAS or doorstep work takes priority and to get him to clearly explain which areas will be covered by the doorstep and which by the EAS process since I will be very unhappy if we fail to avoid duplication. In addition, we will also need to make commercial aware of a reduced capacity to perform analytical tasks as well as model review and gap analysis work etc.

We will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing?  If yes, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact Paul Darcy directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?

James,

Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.

Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.

Bob,

We all realize these are difficult times and we must all adjust and work together but I would like to make you aware of the recent support changes that pose some issues for Logistics.  We are told that the Solution Center is not available after 7:00 p.m.  Monday through Friday nor are they available on the weekend.  We are continuing to schedule gas in Logistics albeit on a limited basis during these after hours so is there anyway IT can manage to provide some level of support?

We appreciate your efforts to work with us to develop a solution.

"19 Month Cash Budget - Due December 18th","Following up on today's meetings, it is critical that we have your revised 19-month Cash Budget as early in the day on Tuesday, December 18th as possible.

(This format file has been revised to correct some formulas on the first page.)

 


Revised/Detailed 19 Month Cash Budget - Due December 18th ASAP
As with the version you submitted earlier this week, revenues, expenses and other items need to be presented on a ""cash basis"".
WE NEED A SUBMISSION FOR EACH BUSINESS UNIT EVEN IF THERE IS NO PLANNED CASH MOVEMENT WITH CORP.
With the exception of payroll, benefits and related items, there should be no allocations in your expense figures.  Networks is working on an overall budget for the organization, and Corporate will budget for rent and insurance expenses (allocations back to the business units will be done at a later date).
If you have not done so already, please confirm with Corporate HR your current payroll and headcount levels and make any adjustments from that level going forward. 
For those business units that have some entities in bankruptcy as of 12/12/01, we will need one file that consolidates all those entities in bankruptcy, and one file that consolidates those that are not.
If as part of the initial submission you had broken out your business units into different segments, please do so for this plan as well.
Where it is requested or noted (*) please provide detailed back-up information on the appropriate sheets.
Please do not add any rows or columns to the first sheet labeled ""format"" or ""O&M_Detail"".

We are hopeful that most of the additional information requested is readily available. If you have any questions please call myself (3-3887) or Mike Deville (5-7852)

"EGM Trading Counterparty Exposure and Contract Review","Tom:

Per my discussion with you this morning, please coordinate with each of the book administrators (and other appropriate personnel) and explain the process for compilation of the counterparty trading exposure data for the EGM commodity trading businesses. The attachments are the templates for listing the counterparties and corresponding trading exposure data. This approach will put the EGM information on the same playing field with power and gas. This will also help with the forthcoming Ernst & Young/Creditors' Committee discussions about valuations and potential settlements with counterparties.

Further to our meeting yesterday attached is an Excel spreadsheet and a form for document review for non-terminated contracts. In order that the review we do of the contracts and information we obtain can be put to best use for both legal and commercial purposes, you will need to input information into BOTH the spreadsheet and the document review form.
	
Don Miller will be advising shortly as to the contact person in his team to whom all the completed spreadsheets and document review forms, in electronic form, should be sent. In addition the document review form should, once completed, be printed out and attached to the front of the relevant contract. For the moment please keep all contracts assigned to you until we decide who should keep and manage these contracts going forward.
	
We are working towards a Monday close of business deadline for the East for completion of this legal review process. I understand that the contracts for the West have not arrived yet and therefore propose that we obtain an update from Christian and Steve on their progress on Tuesday, recognising that Monday is an unrealistic deadline for them.

Subject:	IT & Back Office Service Agreements

Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the estate's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment once a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Services agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enron for everything from email, internet, network services and office applications as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are concerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastructure in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA system and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal was to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and suggest that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information from one system to another until they have put in their own integration between the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put together a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.

Key Planning Assumptions
1) Jan 20 go live
2) New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan 15. This assumes all major production data setup - users, rights, books, global data - is completed and tested on a per application basis. Some code changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ensure the applications still talk to each other. 
3) Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactions from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that applications and interfaces still work. We will not be testing functional permutations, data conditions, validation or exceptions to any significant degree. 
4) Each application conversion team must test their changes before approving their changes for integration testing. We are operating from the premise that data, infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a application system level before the enterprise integration test starts. 
4) All systems will be physically split (even Unify at this point). 
5) Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Estate and New Co. 
6) We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and execution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production. 
7) We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conversion and test team purposes. There are two teams - Conversion and Integration Test. Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co. Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility. 
8) Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co conversion work can begin in earnest. Estate conversion is on the critical path for New Co. 


Key Issues
1) We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial trading first, then physical. If financial is the focus, delivery risk goes down dramatically. For now, we must plan on the worst case -- physical and financial on Jan 20. 
2) We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support AEP and Bridgeline in Estate. This means that we need a dev environment (and HW gap addressed) for Unify, Sitara, CPR, TAGG/ERMS. Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we're in synch. 
3) Unify servers probably can't be owned by New Co while running a single license of Unify. 
4) Some systems are using 'short name' instead of Duns ID as a key for counterparties from Global. The Global, TAGG / ERMS, Unify and SAP reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks. 
5) We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates. We must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading. 
6) We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP / Bridgeline considerations. The time window will be very small.

FYI.  Looks like we got the extension of the Suncor outsourcing agreement.  They had some key staff changes about a year ago and the team has worked very hard to build relationships with the new players.  Is it possible to get 8 more of the 100 point Enron bucks.  They would be a nice token to give the key players in the logistics group as a reward for contributing to this renewal.  Let me know what you think.

Peggy, Laura,
On Monday this week I completed negotiations with Suncor to extend the services arrangement for a 3 yr term out of Jan 1, 2002.  The scope of work will remain as is today, and we will cover IES and SEMI volumes as we do today.
Over the whole negotiation, one item that was never raised was the quality of our back-office services.  They never questioned the quality of the work of your two groups (or the commercial group for that matter).  The issues during the negotiation were related to cost, scope, strategy (do they want us at all) and term.
Thanks as always for the great work of your teams.  I'd be happy to review the deal with the key individuals as we did with PCOG, if you wish.  I'd just like to wait for the signed agreement to be in place - 'cause you never know.  Peter already has the first draft of an agreement ready so we should get that through soon.

"SAP System Response Update","As you may be aware, SAP system response time was slow during earlier this week. As a result, SAP Financials, iBuyit, and iPayit applications were experiencing longer than normal response times on most transactions. The Integrated Solutions Center (ISC) has been working diligently to address the root causes of this issue and has deployed a task force to address the following identified areas:

Technical Issues (Infrastructure and Application related)
Internal Process Improvements (Both within the ISC and in the User Community)
Education of Business Users

We have made significant improvements in the last few days and as a result currently running within normal response time.  We will continue to provide weekly status updates on our continued progress.

"Those 8.30 meetings....","I had an idea for a project which might eventually do away with the need to have 15 people in a room at 8.30 every day to talk about, amongst other things, data feed timings, content etc. and I would love your input.

Don't know if you have seen the application they use in the Gas Control Center for monitoring flows etc but it occurred to me that we might like to build something similar that showed all the upstream systems, processes etc, and data feeds to the risk aggregation tools, summary DPR, which would serve as a diagnostic tool for us to assess our risk process every day.

As you know we have been using 3 dimensional real estate to depict market and credit risk like this

 

and I am experimenting with this concept from a process flow angle, because when looking at this stuff it would be nice to get a feel for the ""freshness"" of the data and the status of the various tasks in the chain.

"Yesterday interview","
Dear Ms. Beck and Ms. Apollo, 
It was a sincere pleasure to meet with you yesterday. The information I  learned during the interview served to confirm the feelings I have always had  about Enron. Unfortunately I received the disappointing news that Enron was not  pursuing employment possibilities with me further. 
I feel strongly that Enron and its  products and services have an exciting growth ahead, and  I  definitely would like to be considered for opportunities available in the  future. 
Again, I appreciate your time and  consideration, and hope to hear from you in the near  future.
Sincerely,

Asunto: FW: Suggestions to help short term morale




In the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I can always count on Bob Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --Sally

Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting.  

Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc. I know security is tight but how about a mini open house. At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"". I know I get excited whenever I'm over there. 

Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc. I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company. Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with. I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity. Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level. Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive. Work out a decent discount to make it exciting. Give it a holiday twist. Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it. 

Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with). Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed. We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more. 

I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company. Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events. Let them feel like there is a real connection. Make it personal and regular. 

Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay. Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point. I'll keep you posted.

"RE: IT Plans for Estate","Anne, can we get an attorney to help us review our contracts with Bridgeline and AEP, determine in bankruptcy what we should do, etc?  

Also, Beth, can we take an interim step where we get approval to hire contractors to help run the estate and fill gaps before we go to a full blown outsource?

 CommodityLogic IP is staying with estate and we are licensing it to NETCO so that should make that asset more valuable since it will have a customer.

Subject:	IT Plans for Estate

Greg,

Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the estate's ability to service IT requests.  The number of people that remain in the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we're receiving resignations now).  With this in mind, I would like to have the ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and potentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accenture or CGEY).  We would need to move the estate employees into this company and incentivize them to stay.  The consulting company could then supplement the staff and the Enron estate employees could now have a career path at the consulting company. 

To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and processing services to other companies.  By the way, this could be done for other commodities outside gas and power.  The deal would have to include royalty payments to the estate for each additional services agreement.  The intent is to make the services company into a thriving business.  We would also want to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.  We could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.

All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estate while the businesses wind down or start up.  We must make sure that the NETCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in some capacity and continue to develop the applications.

As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.  There are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we cannot maintain a fully operational production quality system.  These deals must either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the above referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline).

I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.

I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.  I'll also have my Blackberry but reception is poor on the island!

Have a great holiday.

Beth

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"PLEASE READ -Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power","This mail is the third in the series regarding the acceptance of RiskTrac VaR for UK Power. Please see the previous 2 days which will provide the history.

Essentially we have now reached the stage where we can explain the jump in VaR from moving from the VaR spread sheet to RiskTrac based largely on the good work that Fergus Trenholme - London Risk Management and Stig Faltinsen - London Research have done  (it has been a team effort as many others have been called in as appropriate and I would like to thank them too).

A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are:

the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the 2 systems but not completely (including the change in factor loadings)
the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the 2 systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the (primary and secondary) component curves in RiskTrac. In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though 75% of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve

As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on. That said does the VaR number sound right ? The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market ?The RiskTrac calculated $25m VaR is a 1 day VaR and the  methodology would imply it should be broken 1 in 20 business days. Based on historical P&Ls this has not been the case and so it does not pass the ""sense check"". (note that the original $13m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year).

There are many potential explanations why, but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end (ie only the first 2 years) and the component VarR for this period is in the order of $8m. This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high. The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to ""jumps"" or ""shocks"".  The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not  captured in the current VaR calculation.

Outstanding issues / work

Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves. The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified. Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days / week(s) and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list.

Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR  number  / methodology being calculated / employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the 1 day earnings risk for 19 out of 20 days. It would also be appropriate, given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio, to assess the fat tail risk being run.

I am away for the next 2 weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates.

Subject:	Analysis of variance between spreadsheet VaR and RisktRAC VaR for UK Power

Due to recent variances in UK Power VaR between the VaR spreadsheet (SS) model and RisktRAC (RT), despite small differences in Net Open Positions,  London Research and Risk Management have investigated these discrepancies with the results as below. 

COB 14 May 2001data was chosen as a test example 

			DPR			RT
NOP (TWh) 		43.460		42.255   
VaR	(USD MM)	14.118		24.749    

Summary of analysis: (for UK Power only)

Following checks of  parameter and position inputs to the London VaR SS, and a VaR recalc (with appropriate  inputs from RT), the resultant VaR change does not seem to explain the discrepancies between RT and the SS VaR number.
Consideration of the term structure of the Net Open Positions in both RT and SS showed only minor differences.
Adhoc VaR calculation using SS positions run through RT . The VaR obtained was comparable to the SS VaR. 
Adhoc VaR run through RT with curve positions correctly mapped to the relevant price curves, rather than aggregated to PPP curve.

Analysis of inputs to the London Spreadsheet (SS) VaR model

PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ALL CHANGES WERE PERFORMED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS (i.e one change made and then returned to original state before changing another variable)

Correlations
Impact of RT correlations in SS : NEW VAR = USD 15.220 MM
(Energy Trend (ET) correlations mapped to PPPWD3, as RT does not contain ET correlation data. By keeping ET correlations the matrix became non positive definite, and hence unusable for VaR model). If the correlation matrix is larger (i.e. takes into account more markets) in RT as opposed to the SS this could also have a (marginal) effect (mainly because the Cholesky factorisation will be different). 


Factor loadings

FIVE VERSUS SEVEN FACTOR LOADINGS (SS uses 5 rather than 7 as per RT)

Houston Research (Jaesoo Lew) analysis has shown the effect of using five versus seven factor loadings. Considering one of the primary curves as an example  (PWD3). Five factor loadings describe 96.89 % of the movement of the curve whereas seven factors describe 98.53 %. Therefore the choice of whether to use 5 or 7 factors should not have a substantial impact on the VaR. 



Impact of RT factor loadings in SS : NEW VaR = USD 9.44 MM(ET (Energy Trends curve) with original factor loadings)
						   New VaR = USD  9.55 MM (ET factor loadings mapped to (PPP WD3))

Volatilities 
Impact of RT volatilities in SS : no change in VaR (vols are the same)

Prices 
Impact of RT prices in SS : no change in VaR (prices are the same with the impact of rounding errors providing very small immaterial differences)

Positions
Impact of RT positions in SS : no change in VaR

Forward forward volatilities 
Impact of utilising 'seasonality' flag (set to ON) in SS : NEW VaR = USD 14.650 MM
In RT these are assumed to be ON constantly, as are the fwd fwd volatilities (due to using implied rather than historic vol inputs)
Impact of utilising 'fwd fwd vol' flag (set to OFF) in SS : NEW VaR = USD 18.85 MM
The fwf fwd vol flag should be set to on in the SS model

Combining different parameters
The impact of RT correlations and RT factor loadings and several other combinations all gave changes to the VaR. However, the net result did not substantially differ from the results above (in blue).
 
Other issues:
Intramonth  positions -  not included in RT or  SS (for UKPower).  
Primary and secondary curve mappings. see below for Adhoc VaR results 
Currency conversion : Prices are in GBP. Does any term structure apply to GBP/USD FX (forward) curve used for transformation to USD VaR dollar Forward curve?

Therefore changing the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VaR between the two 'systems', but NOT completely. 

Checking differences in the term structure of positions

UK Power Portfolio is fed from three different sources; ET Elec positions are fed via a spreadsheet to the RT book ""UKPowerswap1"", The Eastern books are also fed via spreadsheet into RT books called ""E1SB1, E1SB3, E2XX1,E2XX3"". The UK Power book positions are uploaded directly from EnPower to the UK Power Portfolio in RT.
Differences:
ET ELEC : none
EnPower : total difference of (62.737) TWh (of which (63.700) is from June 01)
Eastern : total difference of (2,913,408) TWh (for the ' E1SB3' book only). Misfeed causing this error now corrected.

Ad-Hoc VaR Calculation Results

Run 1 :  Positions from the SS where ET Elec was mapped to WD3. VaR = USD 17.813 MM
Run 2 :  Positions from the SS where 1/12 of ET Elec positions were mapped to the 12 primary curves (PPP Wd and WE curves) 
VaR = USD 16.810 MM

The VaR results obtained from Runs 1 and 2 are comparable with the VaR number from the SS. The differences between these runs and the SS number can be attributed to parameter input variances (as described above)

Run 3 : Positions from SS split into component curves (i.e SG, N+P, NBP and PPP) rather than aggregated into PPP curves. ET Elec still split equally over the PPP positions. VaR USD = 25.432 MM.  This is almost exactly in line with the headline UKPower VaR calculated through RT.

UK Power exposure composition (TWh by curve price source)
PPP		(2.9)
NBP		9.5
N+P		(11.6)
SG		(32.6)
		_____
Total		(37.6)

Within the SS, all positions from above (i.e (37.6) TWh) were 'mapped' to the PPP curves, whereas in RT all curves were mapped individually as secondary curves (where PPP acts as primary curve) - even though PPP curve has smallest amount of price risk attached to it through having the smallest Net Open Position. The adhoc results support the assumption that  most of the RT VaR within the PPP_NEW book is due to SG and N+B rather than PPP.

The business may now want to consider the primary / secondary relationships used within RT for UKPower based upon the net exposures against each curve. Research suggests that SG should now become a primary curve based upon these results if price data is available for factor loading and correlation data analysis.. Further analysis on the impact of this change would be needed to quantify the effect of this.

As VaR (at the 95% confidence interval) should typically represent expected losses over 1 day for 1 day in a 20 day period, backtesting should demonstrate this by illustrating a realised PnL loss greater than the VaR number. However, for UK Power, the realised PnL losses have only exceeded the VaR approximately once over the last 300 days. By increasing the reported VaR number, this may not seem appropriate given the underlying reasoning behind VaR and empirical evidence from backtesting. It should be borne in mind that the current structure of the UK Power markets, since the introduction of NETA, has only been in operation for approximately 45 days. For this reason, all data considered for either correlation or factor loading analysis should be considered with care. 

The introduction of NETA into the UK Power market has necesserily created more risk to Enron, especially until the market settles down and gains maturity and stability. Therefore, the revised UK Power VaR of USD 25 MM is not entirely inappropriate, although still appears a high number in absolute terms. Research and Risk Management will investigate the underlying parameter levels during the next few days now that the core assumptions have been verified.

"CHF Learning Teams and Session II","Greetings everyone-
With a week and a half to go until our second session, I wanted to check in
and ask you to begin thinking in your learning teams about how you want to
share the information you have been gathering with the larger group.

On Friday, Nov 2, each team will be allocated 30 minutes to report on what
you have learned, followed by 15 minutes of plenary Q&A/discussion. I
encourage each team to be as creative as possible in your report-outs. Keep
in mind that most adults learn best experientially versus through straight
information download. Thus, if you can find a way to invite the larger group
to sample the learning experience that you had, these sessions will be all
the more effective AND enjoyable. As an example, you could select two or
three key moments -- from a meeting, interview or learning journey -- and
re-enact them for the group. Or bring in any physical ""artifacts"" you might
have gathered on your learning experiences. As I mentioned in our first
session, the diversity learning team last year presented the play ""Let's
Talk"" as their report-out. It was very effective as it allowed all members
of the group to experience for just a few minutes the impact of
discrimination and prejudice and moved us much very quickly to shared
understanding of why this issue is so important on both a community and
personal level, and why they wanted to do something about it.

In these report-outs you don't need to cover every piece of information your
team gathered. Focus on the things you believe will help the whole group in
its decision making around what ACTION(S) you want to take to move Houston
forward. In general, a good guide is to focus on the things you learned that
surprised you and perhaps challenged your pre-existing assumptions.

Remember that you have your chat rooms that Marilou organized as a great way
to communicate. I am available to help in any way I can, so please don't
hesitate to call if you have questions: 978/281-0744.

We'll be sending out shortly a follow-up email with directions to the
Tremont Hotel in Galveston and the agenda.

I look forward to being with you all again very soon!

Importance:	High

Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.   They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e. EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA). 
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice. 
Thanks for your help.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"","Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.

"Mid/Back office people in the London office","
Gary,

Attached is a spreadsheet which shows people that remain in London related to the middle and back office.  These individuals are not solely working on winding down EGM activity there, and we need to make sure that EGM does not pick up total cost when those people are not 100% focused on EGM.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Shanna/Tom,

Are we currently picking up this total cost and allocating as appropriate or are we only paying our percentage?

Subject:	Master Netting Agreement Assignments...Identification of legal entities comprising your assigned ""houses""

Based on the latest Master Netting Agreement Assignment List, you are assigned to one or more ""houses"" to prepare a Master Netting Agreement.  I am currently working on excising natural gas receivables from an existing gas receivable facility known as the Swee'P Receivables Facility.  This ""excisement"" is a prerequisite to our actual execution of the various Master Netting Agreements on which you are working.  In order for me to accomplish the excisement, I need to create a list of each of the non-Enron legal entities, which will be parties to the Master Netting Agreement you have been assigned.  The legal entities are needed so that we may assure that none of these legal entities will have its payables to ENA transferred to Swee'P.  The final submission of receivables is due on Monday, November 5th.  The list I am requesting from you will allow Leslie Reeves to excise your complete ""house"" from the submission of receivables.

I know that each of you are swamped, but this excisement is a prerequisite to the execution of the Master Netting Agreements.  Even if you have only a rough list of the entities in your house, please provide your best available information to me via email, copying the CCs listed on this email.  Thank you for your assistance.

Best Regards,
BNG

"Gossett Promotion Data","  

Sally - 

Thanks for your call.  Attached is the Gas Risk data Jeff provided me today.  I may not have mentioned it in our conversation, but Louise is also looking for a brief explanation as to why a person should be nominated for a promotion.  For any promotions you propose, please develop a few bullets to explain the reasons for this action.  Please call if you or Bob have any questions.  

Thanks - Tana

PS  - I am going to comp now to get the ranges and will forward those as well.

"RE: ENW Costs","I believe you will still have to allocate.  We probably will still have FS reporting requirements; therefore, you will have to ensure the various segments will have their ENW costs.

Wes,
Based on your comments last month, we are not planning on assessing any ENW allocations to other business units (except for regulated companies).  Please let me know if this assumption is not correct.

Subject:	RE: Data needed for Fallon and Delaney

Is everyone responding to you on this?  If not, who are you missing?  I talked to Hall, Perlman and Rub this morning and I assume Sweeney is easy since all his operations people are EIM and EGM.  Also, Apollo and Dayao are probably EES but confirm with them.  Get hem all to respond back to you directly.  

This is also going to be very fluid.  For example, Hall has 43 names or so and we all know that probably and additional 60 or so will get put back to the estate off the UBS list if they go with their plan to take less not more.  Although all of Hall's folks are ENA, the actual names may change.  Also, Jenny Rub has about 100 employees remaining in infrastructure.  This would be desktop support, phones, the network, data centers, etc. and although some techs are dedicated to certain business units, the majority of her group will just support EWS/estate as a whole as they always have.  Her infrastructure group will therefore be shown to you as an org chart with what certain functions groups of people support.  Perlman is attempting to break out but she normally divides by commodity or application, like Unify which cuts across commodities.

Do the best you can.

Thanks.

Dave Delaney and Jim Fallon need the following information for a meeting tomorrow at noon.   They need to know which BU all ENW and ISC employees support (i.e. EGM, EIM, EBS, EES, and ENA). 
I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice. 
Thanks for your help.

"National Web Hub info","
  
Here are the basic elements of the hub concept.  
 
NCL, Inc. at www.nationalcharityleague.org   will be the umbrella site.  Each  chapter that participates will have a web site under this umbrella.  The name will be www.nationalcharityleague/chaptername.org .  The chapters will be given a choice of 4  templates that will allow them to pick colors and graphics that they like.  Each chapter site will contain:
1.      A  front page:  a brief section about  their chapter that can be reached by anyone searching for National Charity  League.  This will be the only  public area.
2.      A  password entry area that will be based on the chapter database or list of  members that they want to have access to their site.  The password entry area will have an  area that members can update their information (change of address, e-mail,  etc.).
3.      The  password protected area will include:
a.        A member listing with address, phone numbers, etc.
b.       Philanthropies and schedules for activities
c.        Calendar
d.       Meeting Schedule (Patroness and Ticktocker)
e.        Newsletters
f.         Bylaws (searchable by keyword)
g.        Ticktocker Procedures (searchable by keyword)
h.        Standing Rules (searchable by keyword)
i.          Hours (this will be a database collection area that each chapter member  will be allowed to submit hours through.   The hours chair(s) will be able to ask for and get a report of all hours  submitted.  The individual members  will also be able to get a summary of their hours as well.  
j.         And finally, a chat area for chapter members.
 
The cost:  A  one-time site set-up fee of approximately $500 (this could be slightly more due  to the uncertainty of additional information that chapters may want on their  site) and a $69.95 per month web hosting fee.  
 
I will train the chapter designated person on how to load  their information onto the web area via a manual that I will prepare and at  convention and phone calls.  Our  service provider will handle technical support for non-NCL content related  problems.  Once the templates are  designed and tested, chapter sites could be ready for uploading within 2  weeks.  The template design and  testing will be done over the next several months if there is sufficient  commitment from chapters.  I'll pick  a date of January 1, 2002 for chapter sites to be ready.  It could be sooner but I have to make  sure that there are enough chapters interested before committing my time to this  project.   
 
I can't think of anything else on this subject.
 
NCL, Inc. Secure Area
Each President will be given a set of user names and  passwords for her Board of Directors.   If they are not available for your meeting, I will send them to each  Board President via mail as soon as they are available.  I am meeting with our hosting company  next week and we will generate the ids and passwords then.  The NCL, Inc. Secure area will have a  directory, the National Reference Manual, NELLIE, Standard Form Bylaws and  Ticktocker Procedures, a Calendar with meeting places and phone numbers,  information on the chapters (including some names and numbers) and a variety of  forms.  There may be other things as  the need arises.    Target  date:  November 1, 2001.

"Thanksgiving reporting (US Holiday)","The following are consolidated DPR reporting & officialization requirements for the US Thanksgiving holiday which is Thursday, November 22 and Friday, November 23.  All US markets are closed Thursday, and NYMEX is closed Fri, but rate and currency markets are open Friday.

Wednesday's trading -
Consolidated DPR - will be prepared on Monday, the 26th
Officializations - no change to normal procedure

Thursday & Friday's trading - 
Consolidated DPR - since most markets are closed, there will be no consolidated DPR for these days. However, if there is trading; positions, VAR and P&L have to be reviewed against limits, separately from the activity of Wednesday's and Monday's trading.  
Officializations - This holiday marks a change to prior procedures due to an increased need for more complete info in RMS.  Ramesh (RAC IT) is going to run a job to copy Wednesday's numbers for Thursday and Friday for all groups for which he has not received books.  I had spoken to a few of you about performing this copy/roll manually.  This is now not required.

This memo should not affect EEL or IR/FX trading.

Please call if you have questions.

Attached is a very simplistic run rate analysis for Beth Perlman's group.  I'm surprised at how close it is once one time reconciling items are included.  Headcount for 2002 is pretty flat to September's.  Please let me know if you would like to discuss this.

"CommodityLogic, Back-Office Commercialization and You","
Over the last several months, the CommodityLogic team has designed, built, and beta-tested a number of ""modules"" to create EnronOnline-type capabilities for the mid and back-office.  By combining these web-based solutions with the back-office commercialization effort, Enron can now offer its clients a complete suite of operational services unique in the industry.

Many of you have also created important pieces in this puzzle, and all of you have valuable client relationships.

We'd like to put all of these elements together.

Please join our team for a demonstration of the CommodityLogic modules and a discussion on strategy next Thursday, June 14, 2:30 to 3:30, 49C1. 

If I have excluded anyone from the invitation list that you feel should attend, please let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you next week.

All the best,

Tom

"Action plan on Seoul Issue from recent Doorstep","We had a conference call this afternoon to discuss the next steps
(Participants:  Beth, Shona, David Port, Jeff Sommers, John Bergren(EAS),  Heidi Mason (person who did Seoul Doorstep from Australia), Darrell Kinder (in charge of the Enron Seoul office and the SK relationship))

The net result of our discussion was that Heidi will be making another trip to Seoul (in 2 weeks) to scope out the deals since the inception of the JV (Jan 99) and to validate that the assumptions that she made in her analysis are correct.  One of Jeff Sommers' people from Houston will accompany her in order to meet some of the people there and take a hand off from Heidi(since she has a day job in Australia)in terms of following up to see that these issues are resolved.

Major Issues to be looked at on round 2:   -- see further detail from Heidi below
1.  Figure out if SK Gas really is intentionally running unprofitable transactions thru the JV with their 100% owned entity SK Global  and quantify(note the $.5mm below is on 		an accrual basis not MTM)
2. Emphasize the need to both the JV and to Enron SK that they need to formalize a trading policy(brought up by AA in the doorstep they did a year ago)
3.  Take a deeper look at their International sales(outside of Seoul) as there are much fewer controls in place; credit issues could be a problem
4.   Propose some regular reporting that should go to the Enron JV people to monitor transations and improve communication


I know Heidi is not thrilled about going back(she had to eat meals with locals who were eating eye balls!)and she is very busy running the Australian operations and back office, but knows that this is an important issue.  Darrell Kinder feels like she will get the best results.    Fernley, just an FYI to you, so that you know she will be heading back there for a few days.

Jeff and I will schedule a seperate download session with the 3 of you for the SK Gas JV once the next trip is complete.

Obtain details of the profitability of all affiliated company deals for the period since inception of the JV.  I have received from SK Gas a break-up of the total P+L for 2000 by transaction type. It is the Cargo trading as per below that we are interested in. Overall there appears to be little movement therefore in the net profit for the year to 31/12/2000 v the rolling 12 months we have. 

 

The data that we have for May 2000 to April 2001 indicates a total loss for trading with SK Global of approx 0.5mn and this is after the inclusion of the one large profit deal that made 0.5mn. Without that deal the loss would have been 1mn dollars versus a profit of 1.8mn on trades with independant counterparties, which is the main reason why we feel we need to further assess these deals further. Regardless of the outcome of the testing however, we need a better process to allow for a current review of these deals either before or when they are done, in line with the JV agreement. 

We need to determine from SK Gas, their trading policy, be this written or verbal. There may perhaps be a reason why the deals with SK Global show a more frequent loss if, for example, SK Global take shipments that SK Gas can not sell elsewhere ie a buyer of the last resort? Without knowing the policy it is very hard to come to any clear conclusions as to the trend seen to date. 											
We need to review the circumstances of some of the larger SK Global deals to try and assess why they were loss making trades. Again, without knowing the trading policy and doing the review so far in arrears, makes it difficult to effectively review all the circumstances of the trade. Therefore, going forward we need to ensure that we implement a policy that ensures SK Corp staff are able to review these trades as they occur when the market factors are more to hand. 

I have discussed with Darrell the option of using resources closer to hand to resolve this, but appreciate his comments that due to the sensitive nature of the arrangements, this will be less than ideal. At the same time, I am not available until the week of the 18th, so timing may also be an issue. Allan Ford is not available to come with me, but I do have an additional resource from Australia if required. Again, there may be an option to use someone else from the region, or AAs who we will need as translators anyway.

Happy to get all feedback and ideas on this plan for tomorrow as I want to have the most comprehensive work plan possible in place before we leave to ensure the visit is as efficient as possible. 

Thanks

Heidi

Jenny,

I spoke with Tammy this morning.  She explained that the Logistics group sometimes run into connectivity issues when login into the network after hours.  She understands our resource constraints, but wanted access to an on-call contact list. We have provided Tammy with the cell phones of all the trader support technicians including Paige Cox, the director.  She will distribute that information to her team. 

At this time, Tammy and I  both agreed that  Logistics did not need access to a 24 X 7 Help Desk. We will monitor the requests from her team to see if the need arises.

Subject:	Broker Client Procedure

Effective today Natsource will have an execute id for www.brokerclient.com which will allow them to execute transaction on EnronOnline for their customers.  Natsource does not intend to execute before Monday the 26th.  As a follow up to a meeting held on March 8th with representatives from your organizations, I wanted to outline the procedures which were discussed for Broker confirmations.  Strict adherence to these procedures will ensure that we mitigate Enron's exposure to broken broker executions.


Broker executes a transaction on www.brokerclient.com
Broker receives instataneous electronic confirmation on broker client
Broker obligation per contract:

On the day of each Execution, Broker will (i) verify each Execution with the relevant Counterparty in writing or by telephone, (ii) notify Enron of such verification by telephone and (iii) deliver to Enron a written summary of all Executions which occurred on such day and confirming the verifications thereof.  Broker agrees that it will record all telephone conversations with Counterparties regarding Transactions and will make copies of such recordings available to Enron on reasonable request.  

Enron will confirm all broker executed transactions by close of business each day  in writing, by telephone or electronically
Any issues raised during the broker confirmation will be immediately brought to the attention of Tom Moran (Houston credit; Debbie Brackett backup), Paul Maley (London Credit; Tim Davies backup).  If you cannot reach any of the credit contacts, call The EnronOnline Help desk at 713 853-HELP and report the broker confirmation issue.  Credit and or Product Control will zero out the broker credit until the issue has been resolved.  Credit and or Product Control will notify the Bob Shults (Dan Diamond backup) of any issues
After a broker has been fully checked out each day, the confirmations group will email the credit contacts listed above with positive confirmation notice indicating that there are no issues for that broker for that day.  This will allow credit to identify potential problems due to someone not calling on issues.
Transactions executed on EnronOnline by a broker will not have any reference to EnronOnline and will be documented as it they were voice brokered transactions.  The transactions will never be contracted under an EnronOnline General Terms & Conditions.
Confirmations with the counterparty will be handle the same as a voice brokered transaction.

"FW: template assignment and license agreement","FYI, update below.

We are trying to get our language in so we at least have a chance to do your idea.

Muller (head of Corp. development) responded saying he will try to get the ideas in to the final agreement with Lance Schuler.  Anne Koehler and I said McMahon supported these ideas.

Basically trying to get the proper language at this (past the 11th hour) so Delainey's NewCo and a service company have a better idea of what the systems can be used for after NetCo.  I don't think the existing agreements actually prohibit it but it is not as clear as it should be for a service company or NewCo wholesale.

Subject: FW: template assignment and license agreement


My suggestions and issues with the latest assignment and license agreement.

First, I have not seen the Contribution Agreement so I don't know the definition of affiliate.  Delainey's NewCo will be interested in that since the document licenses back all the applications to Enron and its affiliates.  Also, if an affiliate becomes a 3rd party due to sell down or sale, we need the ability to continue the sub license to the 3rd parties.

Second, section 2.2 says within 3 business days after Closing Date (as defined in Contribution Agreement) Assignor will deliver to Assignee one tangible copy of Source and Object Code and documentation.  I don't think that follows the plan to duplicate everything by the end of January or early February then get going our separate ways.  I am worried that Enron can't meet that 3 day demand since we are in a process together to copy everything.  Webb should comment on this.

Also, we need the ability to license the non-EOL applications to a third party so they can use them to offer and build a service company around them, including gas and power logistics and settlement.  This 3rd party would not trade against NetCo but would offer mid and back office services to trading companies.  This would actually benefit NetCo since this entity could improves scheduling and settlements in the industry.  Existing NetCo management would understand this.

Also, I think non-compete issues should be at the commercial level in the agreement, not the systems level so I would vote to remove in 3.1 (a) the language around sublicenses in the field of use with trading, etc. as we discussed today.  I am not sure what trading means for this or other documents.

Finally, in section 4.4, what are the prohibited commodities?

Thanks.

Here is a copy of the template assignment and license agreement.   There is
also a version for Wind that splits out the two into an upfront license to
an Enron affiliate followed by an assignment to Wind subject to the
license.

Let me know if you need anything else on this front.

Subject:	Where Are We?   EES Settlements 

When I sent this e:mail on Monday, I committed two things for this week:  a preliminary review of our more detailed plan with the traders (Belden, Black, Presto and Rogers) by mid week and a final proposal of roles and responsibilitiies by the end of this week to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  It is 4:30 pm Friday, and as far as I can tell we have not delivered on either commitment this week.  I didn't hear from the three of you that you couldn't make these time commitments, so I did not reset expectations.  

We must need to reset expectations now.  Can we plan to complete this by Monday afternoon (June 11th) so that I can get back with all interested parties that attended the June 4 lunch meeting?  Do the four of us need to meet briefly this afternoon ( I will stay as late as necessary) or on Monday morning to clarify what needs to be done?  How can I help move this forward?  This topic commanded an hour and a half of Delainey and Lavorato's time at lunch on the 4th, so it is important to them.  --Sally

As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --Sally   (x35926)

"Org Chart - Introduction","Sally - Lloyd Will and I would like to swing by and make a quick introduction.  Also....we would love to talk you out of a high level org chart of your organization.   

I work for Ozzie Pagan in EES and am tasked with getting the EES Retail Operation Center (ROC) off the ground.  My technology guys report in to Anthony Dayao (thru Mike Fink).  We have linked up with Lloyd Will in ENA so that we don't have to hire operators and re-create the functions he has already pioneered with the hourly and cash desks.  I'm also working with Evan Hughes and Murray O'Neal in Beth Apollo's group to define roles/interface points for DG and Load Curtailment products (on the billing/settlement side).  Finally, I'm working with the team that is attempting to define consolodated Risk Systems (Dayao/Accencur et all)

a)  could Lloyd and I get a high level org chart for your org so we recognize/understand/get to know your folks?

b)  Lloyd and I would like to come by for 10 minutes and introduce ourselves - we will attempt to schedule thru Christina

"RE: Data needed for Fallon and Delaney","
Jenny,

Whilst undestanding that you do provide shared services - could you maybe give me a little more detail on what areas you support, what offices/locations, relationship with NetCo, Wholesale, Pipelines etc...What was your allocation methodology for the 2001 budget?

My goal here - for Jim - is to understand how many bodies (& related cost) it is going to take to support the Wholesale Post Bankruptcy actvities - as we are doing for all support and commercial functions - so we can complie a fwd cash forecast.

Any education would be appreciated. An org chart would also help.

Thanks.

Barry.

I've provided all the employees that remain in the estate in the spreadsheet below for you.   There's a tab for each of you with all of your Estate employees listed.    Please designate which company each employee supports and return by 11 AM tomorrow.   
I apologize for the short notice. 
Thanks for your help.

TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE
News from The University of Texas at Austin
____________________________________________
Dear Texas Tribute reader:
This is the first issue of TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE, a monthly e-newsletter offering brief items of interest from the UT Austin campus. Some items will include a link you can click on for a complete story while others will stand alone.
You are receiving TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE because of your interest in and support of UT. Like the printed version of Texas Tribute, the online edition's primary goal is to highlight the enormous impact of philanthropy at the University, and other interesting items will occasionally be part of the mix.
We hope you enjoy TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE, but if you do not wish to receive future issues, simply reply to this message and type REMOVE in the subject field to be removed from our distribution list. Thank you.
And now, on to the news:
TEXAS ICON HERB KELLEHER, founder and chairman of the board of Southwest Airlines (but not a UT alumnus), has given UT's McCombs School of Business $4 million to fund the Herb Kelleher Center for Entrepreneurship. The center, charged with creating the country's leading academic program focused on entrepreneurship, is cleared for take-off and will begin offering classes this spring. There is no word yet on whether the McCombs School will increase its supply of cocktail napkins -- the medium Herb used to sketch out Southwest's first business plan.--> SEE http://www.bus.utexas.edu/news/pressreleases/kelleher.asp
THIRTEEN GIFTED AND AMBITIOUS SCHOLARS from as far away as Spain are calling UT home this year as the inaugural class of the prestigious new Harrington Fellows Program for distinguished faculty and graduate students. ""As we had hoped, the program has enabled us to attract some of the world's best minds,"" says UT President Larry R. Faulkner. ""They bring with them tremendous talent, knowledge, and experiences.""--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/harrington.html
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY to Robert Dedman and the Rev. Jim Fenner that they were UT Law School classmates and fellow members of the Tejas Club, but it was more than 50 years ago. In 1948, Jim loaned Robert $800 to buy a car so that he could get a better job. After a year of selling real estate and insurance, Robert paid Jim $880 - the loan in full plus 10 percent interest. Jim refused the extra $80, saying he wasn't trying to make money on the loan, just help a Tejas brother in need. Robert, who never forgot the gesture, has honored Jim and the bonds of Tejas brothers by endowing a $100,000 Tejas scholarship fund in Jim's name.

Subject:    All Employees Participating in the ENRON Domestic Benefit Plans


Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan, write or call:

Enron Corp Shareholder Relations
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying costs.

"Forecast for 2001","Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity?

"EA confirm problem  (FAX server issues prevented the faxed confirms from coming thru to be processed)","Sally -
Just so you know, this IT problem(see mesage below) has caused lots of late nights and work over the holiday weekend to catch up.  Not totally confident that the cause has been diagnosed, but we will keep pushing IT.   It went un-discovered for quite a while due to the ramp down in Enron Business that has occurred over the last few months(related to Enron's status.)  I mentioned to Beth P. who was aware of the problem.  I just hope that the procedures that they have outlined below are enough to ensure that this does not happen again.

Pat and crew jumped on it  - they worked this weekend to  get rid of the back log.  Everything is up to date in TAGG and showing confirmed-- They wanted to be ready for bid week -- assuming we have the normal high volume.

ALL OK now
Mainly just an FYI  -- in case you hear anything.

Importance:	High

Pat, Carolyn:

Status:
As it stands right now, infrastructure has recovered approximately 14,000 fax messages from the 2 fax servers. 5,213 of the total number were recovered from backups last night. EDMS has been continuing to support records management in getting these fax messages processed and has been printing the faxes since last weekend. We will print the remaining 5,213 tonight.

The question of total number of confirmations that were affected by this is still unknown until these documents are released to LiveLink. So far, 7,961 confirmations have been indexed. An additional 1,800 (approx.) will be indexed tonight. These documents will need go though the OCR process, routed to the LiveLink workflow process, and then filed in LiveLink. We currently do not have any indication on how many confirmations will be in the 5,213 fax messages still to be processed.


Investigation To Date:
The infrastructure team is continuing to investigate what went wrong with the facsys servers. Unfortunately, the servers did not give any indication that it was not properly routing fax messages until it completely stopped routing fax messages last Thursday, November 15, 2001. Apparently, some of the fax messages were being routed and the assumptions have been that the reduced volume over the past few weeks were attributed to Enron's current market position. The problem was compounded with the automated monitoring tool that supposed to alert administrators did not function as intended. 


Immediate/Future Actions:
To ensure this does not happen again, continuous monitoring will be done. Infrastructure will continue to be responsible for the facsys servers. They will manually monitor the facsys servers until we have the necessary utilities in place for the EDMS team to monitor them. They will send e-mail confirmations of checks daily (9 am and 3 pm on weekdays, once during weekends/holidays). Brian Larkin has indicated that this tool will be available next week. Additionally, the infrastructure team is accelerating plans to ensure proper support of the facsys servers are established.

Should any issues arise regarding the facsys servers, EDMS will utilize the following escalation process:
1. Contact the Emergency Hotline @ 713-345-4911
2. Joe Kachinski
3. Wilford Stevens
4. Brian Larkin

If we are unable to contact any of the people indicated above, the problem will be escalated to the proper management reporting structure until it is addressed.

Thank you very much.

"RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA","Pretty huge cuts,   I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from other areas).  This is probably all the detail I'll require.  Let me have your final numbers when you can.  Obviously if there are any senior position changes I think the gas and power guys would have a view as they do know who they like or not.

We do want to run the business as is, I think the big difference is new IT projects, we should still look at them but ones on a short time scale.  On Operations I think we just know that any growth planning we had envisaged is no longer required - we need to just get back to where we were.

Subject:	Preliminary Cost Savings for EA

From our work weekend before last, our third scenario (staying in the business, but making improvements more slowly and reducing some service levels), our estimated savings for Operations and IT Development were:

	Annualized Savings (in millions)  & Headcount Reductions (Enron Employees)

Direct Costs			Bonus		Subtotal 			Net 		Cap		Total 
Ops		IT		Accural		Savings		Severance	Savings		Ex		Savings

5.4		12.8		1.5		19.7		3.8		15.9		11.8		27.7	Dollar Savings


65		71		-		136									FTE Reduction



This work was not done at the level of identifying individuals, but rather positions.  identify indiOur work today will be to further refine this estimate and to individuals' names.  We have already identified our lower performers across Operations and IT as well.  We had to get through our work this weekend in identifying higher performers supporting EIM and EGM who could potentially support EA and EES in an effort to provide an even stronger team for those two business units.  

The above estimates of cost savings did not include savings from Jenny Rub, which she can calculate for us based on detail of headcount reductions and any systems work that is discontinued (i.e. server savings).  The estimate also did not include any potential reductions in the EOL charges for EA that may result from cost reductions that Greg Piper is having with Brad Richter.  

Your desire to cut costs for EA but not reduce work force seem to be incompatible.  We will do our work and then see how we can reconcile this with you.

"Canada","Sally -

I think we probably need to meet about this today.  (Peggy, Beth (Shona),  and myself).  Apparently,  the Canadian power trader has been building a very large gas position over the last two weeks.  There are two issues in my view:

1.) Canada set up post ID's to run through enpower and not pick up the positions on the gas side in US dollars.  We are therefore unable to capture the positions for a net Natural gas position.

2.)  These gas books were set up, and somewhere the communication broke down between Canada,  the controls group,  and my group.  Clearly,  we have to put new procedures in place if 150 bcf short can just ""slip through the cracks.""

Subject:	Canada

Canada has a very large natural gas position that appears to have not been captured in value at risk. (Approx short 150bcf price, a total short 250bcf if we include the basis leg.)  For example, the gas desk alone has a total position for today of short 283bcf, Zufferli nearly 50% of the total position
  
We simulated ad hoc VAR, and looking at the NYMEX position alone VAR is approx $7MM.
Added to Canadian power VAR,  risk is approx. $13MM, it adds about $3MM of risk to the entire power portfolio.

However, to the gas portfolio it adds approx. $6MM of risk, giving us a VAR of $87.5, a limit violation had it been captured and included in VAR.

I'm unclear as to how books can be created and yet not mapped into VAR.

"Savings","
OK Kerry  -- here is the high level summary

My net cuts for Global Services   -- across the DPR team, Global Counterparty, Contracts and OPM -- by Business unit

EGM  900,000
EIM   300,000
EA    100,000   -- less dpr service -- no global standards reporting etc
----------------------
$  1,300,000   total cut  -- pure salaries  -- not loaded with benefits or any overheads/bonus or anything

You will have to net off severance for about $400,000 worth of salary that is 8 employees  ($224k for 8 people at avg $28k per person)  the rest are contractors or positions that were budgeted for which we will not fill, or people who will be re-deployed into EES  I assume that HR gave you some average rate

Kerry will assume you will add the rest on to this


EES there is no net savings  -- for every single person that I am severing  -- we are re-deploying someone from EIM or EGM into the role.    But there will be severance costs for another 20 ($560k at avg $28k per person)     people who's salaries total about $ 900,000   --- this should be the same severance that was avoided in EIM or EGM -- as their people are moving over to fill these spots

Hi Leslie,
 
As per our conversation, I have attached the graphs and trend data for the ""top ten"" counterparties. These graphs and data represent the EOL deal counts for each counterparty, by business day, since 9/24 and are based on Activity Reports run from the EOL database.
 
The trends are great, as all of the major financial counterparties are either doing business as usual, or actually increasing their activity with us slightly.
 
I will be in the office by 7AM tomorrow, so please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Subject:	Operational Risk Management

I want to move forward with scheduling the initial meeting of the Operational Risk Management task force.  How does Tuesday, October 16th and the afternoon of Thursday, October 18th look for everyone?  Please let me know your schedule for both of these dates.  Most of the task force members have been identified, with the exception of those from GRMO and IT.  Sally Beck will identify representatives from these two areas.  I would also expect that other individuals may be consulted from time to time as additional expertise or resources or required.  

I intend to schedule a two-hour block of time for this meeting.  The agenda will include, at a minimum,  the following topics:

	Definition of Operational Risk for  Enron - What's in and What's Out
	Preliminary Goals for Operational Risk Management (to be refined by the group)
	     Develop Common Language
                 Identify Framework for Monitoring Risk
	     Role of this task force  - Strategy
	     Set common objectives for implementation this year and a look forward to 2002
	Current Initiatives
	Communications Plan 
	Open Discussion - Other Ideas from the group 
			  - Suggestions re other groups/individuals to include on the task force
	

I am excited about leading this initiative for Enron.  We have a unique opportunity to define operational risk measurement for Enron, develop reporting guidelines, and provide qualitative assessments of operational risk, all of which will be considered during the risk capital allocation process.   But most importantly, we can identify ways to mitigate Enron's exposure to operational risk.  Please call if you would like to discuss any of the above prior to the meeting.  

Thanks, 
Wanda Curry

I have been offered the opportunity by Giga (our IT research company) to have their head researcher come in to give an informal talk to our ENW leaders on what Giga see as major trends in IT in 2002. I've accepted this offer and will have him present at our ENW staff meeting on 8th November. I think it might be quite interesting, hope you do too.

"Good news about the Financial Times and Dow Jones Interactive","Dear Subscriber:


In our continuous commitment to enhance the services we offer
you, Factiva is proud to announce the expanded availability of
the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

  <B>Enron</B>, the country's largest marketer of natural gas and a
business
partner of independent producers since 1985, is expanding its
services to a complete menu that will help producers more
efficiently manage their entire business.

  Thanks in part to technical advances such as wellhead measurements
that are more accurate than ever and strategic partnerships with
application service providers (ASPs), <B>Enron</B> Producer Services can
now deliver any technical or back-office service necessary for
natural gas production and accounting.

  From its traditional menu of transportation, gas treating and
processing, risk management and financing options to asset, risk and
capital management, and now a full complement of
information-technology and backoffice services, <B>Enron</B> Producer
Services can deliver any service a producer needs to focus on
managing the growth of a competitive and profitable business.
  For the first time, <B>Enron</B> enables producers to choose any
service,
from pipeline connection to royalty payments-to begin and end at the
wellhead in one seamless transaction.
  APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
  <B>Enron</B> Producer Services helps producers reduce overhead costs by
eliminating the need to maintain administration, accounting and
information-technology staffs.
  <B>Enron</B> can supply the trained personnel, equipment and facilities
to
perform administration, accounting and financing duties such as E&P
accounting, joint venture accounting, revenue accounting, financial
transaction processing, expenditure authorizations, tax payments,
regulatory filing, royalty payments and full production accounting.
  Outsourcing such back-office responsibilities to <B>Enron</B> and its
strategic partners will result in higher productivity, lower costs
and improved customer relationship management. All financial
information resides securely in one integrated system, yet the
producer has no need to make a long-term investment in costly
technology infrastructure or personnel-intensive backoffice
services. Growing companies can thus focus on their core business
while <B>Enron</B> ensures the producer has secure, real-time access to
its
financial data anytime and anywhere.
  Through its business partners, <B>Enron</B> Producer Services can supply
all forms of state-of-the-art industry hardware, software, services
and highly trained technical professionals.
  Bob Tretiak, chief executive officer and president of Applied
Terravision Systems, one of the business partners, says, ""The
business relationship between <B>Enron</B> and ATS will facilitate a
dramatic change in the production operations of an upstream
petroleum company by providing new operating efficiencies,
flexibility and other significant benefits-thus allowing a company
to focus on its core competencies.""
  <B>Enron</B> has the ability to provide producers with crucially
accurate,
real-time information about the quality, quantity, composition,
destination and ownership of the natural gas they recover. <B>Enron</B>
guarantees realtime and accurate data delivery, thus enabling
producers to make the decisions that will directly lead their
business to achieve its full potential.
  For example, a business partner with <B>Enron</B> Producer Services,
Hanover Measurement Services, uses leading-edge technology to
electronically meter and monitor natural gas production of large and
small wellheads at thousands of facilities on a 24-hour basis. With
such accurate and real-time information, producers can manage their
day-to-day operations more efficiently than ever before. For one
Houston-based organization that owns more than 5,000 miles of
pipeline and transports approximately 2.5 billion cubic feet of gas
per day, Hanover reduced lost and unaccounted-for gas to 0%-a
significant eight-- figure savings for calendar year 2000.
  Hanover is also developing an Internet-based system to provide
secure, real-time management and transmission of gas measurement
information-offering accurate energy measurement and the reliable
transmission of that information tailored to meet each customer's
specific needs.
  The system allows <B>Enron</B> Producer Services to capitalize on
economies of scale and offer the most cost-effective measurement
services to the industry.
  BUILDING THE FUTURE
  <B>Enron</B> Producer Services also has the experience and expertise to
provide all the commodity risk management services that producers
need to stabilize their cash flow and earnings. Using a custom,
strategic combination of caps, floors, swaps, collars and other
risk-management tools from <B>Enron</B>, producers can reduce their
company's exposure to volatile prices, enhance shareholder value and
thereby attract more investors and lenders.
  <B>Enron</B> has the capital resources, the infrastructure and the
desire
to help producers maximize business potential and exceed their
goals. It can customize a menu of its value-- added services and
pricing plans to suit any producer's needs, thereby reducing
overhead and streamlining back-office tasks so producers can
concentrate on building their core business.
  <B>Enron</B> Producer Services will partner with producers to help
efficiently manage their day-today operations and back-office
infrastructure, thus allowing them to attain their long-- term goals
for business growth, profitability and competitive success.
  Working with <B>Enron</B> Producer Services has several immediate
benefits: it eliminates overhead, it provides accurate, real-time
information and measurements on a daily, not a monthly, basis,
positioning their production to be responsive to the hourly
transactions demanded by the power market. It further capitalizes a
producer's operations-both technologically and financially-to afford
the company better business decisions. In this way, <B>Enron</B> is
helping
producers to reap greater benefits from their commodity, effectively
leverage their core capabilities, gain efficiencies, find
opportunities, and therefore profitably respond to an increasingly
complex and competitive natural gas market.
  The <B>Enron</B> Producer Services team represents an experience level
in
wellhead transactions of more than 35 years for <B>Enron</B>. No other
company has combined the physical commodity with the technology,
resulting in a wellhead-to-burnertip transaction with no further
distributions necessary when producers receive their production
payment. This powerful combination of the physical and the technical
creates an immediate impact on the producer's bottom line, today and
for the future.
  <B>Enron</B> has created the Wellhead Desk to help customers manage
their
physical commodity. The service is a comprehensive suite of products
inclusive of nominations, scheduling and balancing. The Wellhead
Desk is capable of managing all of a producer's commodity needs,
ranging from logistics to physical risk mitigation strategies.
Customers will interact directly with the Wellhead Desk and it will
act as an account manager for customers. <B>Enron</B> will interface with
various internal business units to maximize value for producers.
  ""In this time of capital constraint, <B>Enron</B> offers a convenient
one-stop shop for the producer community allowing them to focus on
their core competency-developing reserves. The value extracted from
developed reserves can be maximized when associated company
infrastructure costs (i.e., accounting, scheduling, marketing, etc.)
can be minimized,"" says jean Mrha Beach, vice president, <B>Enron</B>
Upstream Products.
  Whether the producer is large or small, <B>Enron</B> can provide a
fee-based service on request, which will be both affordable on a
cost basis and profitable on an earnings basis. In the mind of
<B>Enron</B>
Producer Services, the producer truly is No. 1.

"status of London Doorsteps","Dear Beth & Sally,

I just spoke with Mike J - due to competing priorities and the current environment, Michael Brown feels that there should not be any London Doorsteps in Q4 and is discussing this with Buy and Causey.  I don't have any information on either of their responses to Michael, I'll let you know if I hear anything.  

I haven't told any of the doorsteppers that their visits may be postponed.  Currently, most of the doorsteps are scheduled for the week of Nov. 5. 

In regards to the doorstep I am going on (Warsaw, Recycling, Frankfurt Cont Power & Gas) Mike agrees that one should still continue.

Regards

Dear Andrew-

London Metals has been selected to be reviewed under the ""Doorstep"" process the week of Nov. 5.  The process involves a review of the current market issues as well as an operational review of the front/mid and back operations.  The doorstep team will consist of Brenda Herod, a member from RAC and an Andersen staff member.  I am helping facilitate the process.

In order to start this process, I need to get a few items from you:

A list of traders and Orginators who can help our team gain an understanding of the current Metals business
A list of mid/back office personnel whom that we could talk to help us understand the existing control structure and management reporting as well as anyone else who we might need to meet with that you feel would or could add value to the process
A population of deals and transactions over the last 10 -12 months that will allow us to start pulling our sample for deal testing
Any other material that you may have that would allow us to do some pre-reading prior to our visit in order to help our understanding of the Metals business.

We will be working closely with EAS/Andersen to ensure that we are not duplicating efforts.  

Please advise as to how would be the best way to schedule interviews - would you prefer that we contact the individuals that you identify for interview or should we coordinate that process through someone in London.

Thank you for your help.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at (713)853-1781. 

Regards,
Christy Lobusch

Sam & Anna,
I agree that GCP should be the source for counterparty data and, as you have indicated, this is currently the case.  I disagree that the functionality in TWS represents a fraud or control risk.  There is segregation of responsibilities within TWS which requires 2 different individuals to either initiate or change payment instruction.  This control has been audited repeatedly and has been determined to be sound and adequate control.  As with any bank operation, it is necessary for Treasury to be able to correct fatal errors. 

 We have implemented procedural controls so that GCP is notified of any issues with counterparty data.  I understand that GCP is responding promptly.  If you find a deficiency in this area, please let me know and we will do whatever is necessay to ensure that adequate communication is undertaken.

I understand there may be some issues related to payments executed from NY bank accounts.  I'd be pleased to discuss this issue.

I look forward to meeting with you this week.
Mary

Subject:	Message from Anna McAndrew & Sam Kemp - Operational Risk in TWS

Mary

We are in the porcess of reviewing the Control environment within Settlements in London.  This review has included the interaction between Settlements and Cash Management / TWS system. 

One issue which we have identified is that the Cash Management Team have the ability in TWS to change the counterparty bank account details which have been fed into TWS via GCP and SAP.  Whilst procedurally, the cash management team do not edit these details, the fact remains that they could if they wanted to.  At best this presents operational risks (someone might edit the details in error) and at worst, presents opportunity for fraud. 

In order to ensure effective segregation of duties and minimise the operational risk we would like to remove the ability for the Cash Management Team to make these changes and restrict the entry point for this data just to the GCP Team.  We understand from Anne Hicks that you would need to sign off on such a functional / coding change in TWS. 

Sam Kemp, Head of GCP, and I are in Houston next week and I believe we have some time in your diary so we can discuss.  In the interim, we would welcome any initial thoughts you might have.

Kind regards

Sam & Anna

Subject:	Murray O'Neil's expenses



George -

This note is to confirm that Murray O'Neil's latest expense report (roughly $2,000) was for valid,  POST-petition business.  He travels from Portland where he is based, to Houston, as needed, to work on Power settlements and volume management for EES, and these expenses are for airfare, hotel and meals for the week prior to the Christmas holiday.  Per our discussion, I assume that these were held up by the system due to the $5,000 limitation, for further review.

Please have a member of your team expedite the review of this expense report, so that it can be released today, if possible.  I assume that they will confirm to us that the report has been released so that Murray will no longer be behind in his expense reimbursements, since he will be traveling to Houston again (and therefore incurring expenses) on Monday.

I understand that Enron is not issuing cash advances, but that once the initial backlog of expense processing is done, that reimbursement will occur much more quickly, now that we are in the post-petition environment.

Thanks so much,

Beth

"People Transfer","I am due to get the revised Risk Management reorganization groupings this afternoon.  At that point, additional cost centers may need to be set up so it will probably be the first of next week before any transfers could begin to happen.

Given that it will be the third week of May at that point, the effective date will probably have to be June 1, 2001 for SAP cost center reporting (correct)?  In any event, to enable us to have as clean a cut-off as possible for financial reporting purposes, I would like to wait and make these moves effective July 1, 2001.  That way their existing cost centers are pure for a full quarter and the new cost centers start off clean in a new quarter.  This will also help us from a planning perspective in developing a clean go-forward budget for these groups.

This will have no impact on our financial reporting, we will simply allocate costs to EWS from EES, rather than EES receive a charge from EWS for the entire second quarter.

Unless I hear strong objection to this, we will work toward a July 1, 2001 cutover.

Subject:	Reply Requested: Justification to Call Back Part Time Contractor

Sally, Greg and Rick: Last week two employees in the ISC resigned. Please see summary and attached detail justification to bring back one part time contractor to cover for the resignations and support critical activities. 

Please confirm by email to approve this request. The projected total ISC labor cost will be below the approved budget with the resource changes described below. 

Summary

Two ISC Employees working in the technical services group resigned last week. Greg Bert an application developer, and Fazil Osman our most senior employee working on the SAP system infrastructure and Basis area.  

We will not replace Greg Bert at this time. We have other contractors working part time in the ISC who can increase their hours if needed to cover for Greg leaving.

We will need a replacement for Fazil Osman in order to maintain SAP system availability and service levels. 

Fazil was our most senior employee working in the SAP System Infrastructure and Basis area. The SAP System Infrastructure group is responsible for maintaining system availability, performance and backup and recovery services. 

A replacement for Fazil is needed to enable Enron to maintain expected levels of SAP system availability six days a week 24 hours a day. A reduction in SAP system availability could cause potential business disruption and affect Enron's ability to pay vendors, pay employees and manage cash. Paul Calvino a consultant with Entersys Group was previously with the ISC for two years, and was let go December 2, 2001. Paul can replace Fazil working part time 20 hours a week. Entersys is a preferred supplier and is on Enron's critical vendor list post petition. 

This is the lowest cost short-term replacement for Fazil given the difficulty, time and cost associated with recruiting an employee. Also, Paul is available to work part time for services as needed. 

Proposed Replacement: Paul Calvino - Basis Consultant 
Vendor: Entersys Group
Duration:  3/31/02 or until business needs change
Contract Rate Per Hour: $185/hr at 20 hours per week

Subject: priorities for 1/16 and accomplishments for 1/15

1/15 - 

curve val: we have scoped the curve val project and have discussed it with PwC. I've talked to E&Y in general terms and have a meeting with them on this at 10 today. We have also had initial discussions with the different risk groups about the holes in the curve construction & upload process and our deliverable for the end of today is a list of where the holes are and a plan to fill those holes.

We spent significant time with E&Y to go over the make up of the DPR. 

We are working with the different groups on the 12/31 DPR information. So far, we have only had one request for it. My gut feeling is that EIM & ENA are complete, but ECTRIC & EGM need a bit more time. Chris should have a complete status ready for today.

Our systems are fixed (hooray!). Yesterday we caught up on the Enovate and Bridgeline DPRs as well as spent significant time with IT to get the systems fixed.

Susie is still working on the SEC VAR for 10/31, 11/30, and will start 12/31 as soon as all of the information is available. She has also started the net assets work.

Lastly, the whole group had CAS training so once we get access to the system we can start pulling info by counterparty.

 

Today our goals are:

Curve val - finalize memo (getting agreement from PwC, E&Y, and Enron estate), put listing of curve construction plan fwd, start determining what the different buckets of curves are and what tools are available to perform analysis

Field more E&Y DPR qus

Have a complete status report on the 12/31 DPR.

Prepare ongoing reporting (Enovate, Bridgeline etc).

I also hope to get some time to familarize myself with the CAS environment.

Subject:	Formation of The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services Group

We are pleased to announce that EES, FieldCentrix and a group of outside investors have formed a new company to be referred to as The Facility Services Group.  This group is charged with creating a national service network to provide predictable and scalable repair, maintenance and other facilities services for retail customers, including many of EES's existing and future customers.  The Facility Services Group is expanding its vendor management platform to allow service technicians to focus on efficient, predictable service while capturing data on a real time basis and will provide scalable execution capability for the vendor management and O&M products.  We expect these products and services to create significant value.

The Facility Services Group includes Enron Building Services, Inc. (EBSI), The Linc Company, the HVAC Services business (all three, formerly part of Enron Facility Services), Interactive Process Technologies (IPT) and FieldCentrix, Inc., a mobile workforce management software company.  The Management Team of the Facility Services Group will include existing management from these companies.

FieldCentrix is a leading provider of wireless, Internet-based field force automation software.  Founded in 1994, the 125-employee company was recently named one of Frontline Solutions Top 100 companies and also received the Cingular Best Solution award for 2001.  The Facility Services Group will use the FieldCentrix and IPT platforms to provide a superior predictive and preventative maintenance program through vendor management to customers.  Tracy Price, President and CEO of FieldCentrix, will lead The Facility Services Group.  

The remaining components of Enron Facility Services (EFS) will be re-organized into The Construction Services Group.  This group will be led by Steve Wurzel and will include: Limbach Facility Services, the Architecture & Engineering group and the Construction Management Services group.  The Construction Services Group will continue to provide Engineering and Construction Services to Third Parties and EES.  We expect this group to continue to be an important and valuable part of EES's financial performance.

Dave Whaley will continue to manage the shared services groups, including legal, finance, HR, and IT, across The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services Group.  The centralization and sharing of these support services is cost effective, scalable and responsive.  In addition, Dave will assist in the transition of the EFS companies to The Facility Services Group.

Joe Earle has decided to leave Enron at the end of this year.  Until then, Joe will continue to work with the line businesses and assist with the transition of the EFS companies to The Facility Services Group and The Construction Services group.  Under his leadership, EFS and all of its companies have continued to be leaders in their fields.  Please join us in thanking Joe for his 10 years of leadership with the EFS companies.  
The re-alignment of our activities and the creation of a new entity to focus solely on serving the $136 billion facility services market will assist our entire organization in achieving our 2002 and beyond goals and objectives.

RAC control the corporate risk policy (please correct me if I am wrong here) so by definition RAC need to be concerned by the operational issues around new products as they relate to ensuring that the end goal of aggregation in the overall Corporate VAR. That is the issue which will continue to face us as the markets expand and deregulate and more and more basis locations get added (the problem we have right now). 

All the investment banks have a new product / new business policy to stop just those issues we are facing and I strongly feel that we should more to adopt the same here. This would help to reduce the noise we are having around the process and close one more door.

Subject:	New product approvals

James,

Further to your comments yesterday on the absence of a policy for New Product approvals, as far as I am aware there is no explicit policy by RAC for approval of new products, other than the extent to which a new product is covered under this paragraph in the Risk Policy manual:-

VI / A.	Subject to the authorization of the Board of Directors, the Enron Corp. Chairman, the President of Enron Corp. and the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer, additional Portfolios may be created and additional Commodity Groups may be added within existing Portfolios, and the related limits will be created or revised accordingly. The President of Enron Corp. and the Enron Corp. Chief Risk Officer can authorize additional Positions within the existing Commodity Groups, provided that such Positions can be aggregated within the limits of a currently authorized Commodity Group. 

RAC's concern is not with the operational issues around new products, but about whether or not those products are aggregated in the overall Corporate Risk reporting.  I suggest we approach this from our respective ends:  I will raise this with Ted Murphy and Cassandra Schulz to see what level of policy they deem appropriate from a corporate perspective.   From your side, are you able to put together some operational guidelines, if none already exist?

regards

Lloyd

So I left there on Monday, Elaine (my old boss at ms)called me on Tues and wanted to know if I was interested in going back to Enron at the same pay I left at with full benefits (except the matching stock of course (not funny!) back to work for her husband Bob Williams and his assistant Jan.  He is putting together a task force to help with the SEC stuff.
 
I can say is,  God has taken such good care of me, its been one miracle after another.  GOD rocks!

"FW: ECS Consolidation","Sally,

Fallon's goal is to try to get all ENA Estate and EGM Estate employees on the 4th floor.  They are asking us to squeeze into 45 desks (doesn't include offices and admin stations).  

Operations employees supporting EIM and EGM were already counted in EGM's and EIM's counts.

I'm trying to find out if the Estate employees under Bob Hall employees were counted in Don Miller's count.

Bottom line is, if Fallon really wants to get everyone on the 4th floor, he's going to have to wait until EOL moves to 6, or pay to shift EOL somewhere else in the meantime.

Al,

ENW would most likely fit in the spaces we discussed (141-198) barring any major shift in the number of employees classified as NetCo or Estate.  It will probably be at least 3-4 days before the number can be determined.  However, I've learned that EOL will not be moving to the 6th floor for at least 2 weeks due to a lack of space on the churn schedule.  

There are 32 EOL employees in the 301-346 range that would have to move temporarily to accomplish your goal. You should speak with Tammy Shepperd about this as she is coordinating the EOL move to the 6th floor.

"Post Mortem on ERMS books not getting into RisktRAC","Problem:  
14 ERMS EGM books were not picked up in RisktRAC due to a mismatch of attributes between ERMS and RisktRAC.  

Root Cause: The over riding issue is that the current processes to keep RisktRAC up to date are so manual that the probability of errors such as this occuring are very high (point in fact - I had 1.5 people doing this last year and now have 4 + 2 managers to support + 1 director to support them).  Specifically, what occured in this case is:

Attribute mismatches happen frequently when there is more than one commodity per in the source system book.  When setting up new books, the book admin must indicate that there is more than one commodity in the book (or that the commodity identifier ie BRN has changed to BRNT) so Risk Analytics can set up the appropriate number of books (there is not a one to one ratio between ERMS books and RistRAC books).  In this case, these books were already being used for BRNT trades.  At the end of Aug/ early Sept these books also started being used for BRN and BRCM positions as well.  The additional usage for these books was not communicated to Risk Analytics therefore no additional books were set up in RisktRAC.  Additionally, there was no effective compensating control for Risk Analytics to catch this problem.

Procedures to ensure this doesn't happen again:
Short term
1) Training - training sessions for book admins to remind them of RisktRAC requirements- pilot class has been taught and first ""real"" class is Wednesday of this week.
2) Compensating control to be put in place - Risk Analytics is creating a role to review all exception reporting available on a daily basis (whether a book came from the source system but was not picked up by RisktRAC, whether a book was picked up but not included for VAR purposes etc).

Medium term
Greenlight - revamping benchmarks to pull from RMS (table where data is kept for RisktRAC) so the positions per ERMS can be easily reconciled to RisktRAC, other projects within RisktRAC being identified.

Long term
Strategic vision of RisktRAC (front end & all exception reporting needed) - user requirements being developed.

Wanda's QU's not answered above:
1) How long have these books not been in RisktRAC - Our best guess is end-August, early Sept when the books started to be used for several commodity types.
2) What is the impact on VAR?  -  The preliminary VAR for Thursday's trading was $12.928 million.  This export did not have the 14 books in it.  The final VAR for Thursday morning was $12.892 million. The final had about 10 of the 14 books - the other four hadn't yet been set up.  .2% - clearly immaterial
3) What was the volume missing?  300K barrels (per EGM).  - total positions were 5.3 mil BBL for Thursday's trading - approximatly 6% - a bit more material.

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

"Contractors","Sally,
 
here is the list..... sorry it's a little later than the 4pm deadline.... I had to go bully some people to convince them to yield their contractors.
 
The top section is for those few we should retain, with short explanations in the comment field. The 2nd section is the main set with end date. At the bottom is the anticipated monthly burn rate saving.
 
This list does not contain the EGM/EIM contractors as Jeff Johnson was to send you his seperately.
 
Please let me know, when you want us to pull the trigger on the contractors....!

Subject: Independent Kiodex analysis of EnronOnline risk?


Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.  Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty

"ENW Estate Cash Forecast","Greg (Adams),
Attached is our cash forecast.  There are several important points to keep in mind with this forecast:
1. This is our best guess at this point.  As other business units clarify their business plans, it will affect our activity. Once their plans are set and communicated to us, we can better forecast our numbers.
2. This forecast represents the estate only.  (Since that is what we discussed in the meeting on Monday)  We have made no attempt to forecast NETCo since that has already been done and is seperate.
3.Infrastructures numbers are somewhat soft due to the Outlook problems experienced yesterday.  As they firm up or we get additional information, we can update numbers.
4. We have not included any future severance or retainage payments as we discussed.
5. I have included a tab which attempts to segregate costs by business unit.  Again, this is soft and will be better defined as the business units define their plans.
6. I will be out of the office after today for a while.  If you have questions after today, contact Mike Galvan (x3-5439) or Kevin May (x5-2508)
7. I have not put this file on the O: drive since it is being emailed.  Let me know if I need to.

"EBS's ENW 2002 Requirements - Private & Confidential","As you both are aware (not publicly) we are 'right-sizing' again. 

This will impact EBS's requirement for services from ENW.

We are finalizing the revised 2002 'look' and it's not pretty. Confidentially, we will be significantly lower than the 440 we have at present.

As far as I predict right now we'll need the following:

IT Development/Systems

I've met with Inja and asked her to plan for 'minimal maintenance mode' - no development - by 1/1/02. I've asked her to shoot for no higher than $2m - from $11.2m. I realize this will involve potential periods of down-time and very thin coverage - unfortunately it's all we can afford. Inga came back at $1.95m - wihout herself - however, we will need a strong leader - and I've asked her to look at anyway she can stay involved/manage what is going to be a lot of 'no, sorry can't do that' conversations.

This covers upkeep of EnFiber, NETS, EComms, Remedy, PPCS, Fact and all our DB requirements.

IT Infrastructure

I've gave Jenny/Kerry a heads-up of around 300 folks for 2002 a couple of weeks ago - we will be lower. Our space and IT requirements will be lower accordingly. We will based out of Houston with a Shepherd warehouse. No Europe/Asia support can be assumed. We will also not require EOL. Let me know what I get for 'not much to spend'.

Energy Ops

Currently at $5m supporting 36 folks. This will be trimmed to 17 folks. We will also need a small Contract Admin support level from Pat W's team.

That's a heads-up. Sorry it's such unpleasent news. Let me know if I've missed anything.

Barry.

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Let me know how you want me to handle, but I knew I would get screwed on this.

Do you think I should play hard ball with them.  Mike has already emailed me and said that he will try to work on them from his end.

I need him to start getting involved with EES to offload Scott and really progress the strategic system side,  and with more Risk people on the table now in Houston, I would think that if London can't give him up, then maybe we should consider another option with someone from EIM or EGM.

Let me know what you think

Beth

I have been speaking with Matthew regarding the ""work-out"" plan for EBS in Euorope and it looks as though he'll require my services here in London up until beginning of Jan-02.

There are a number of options we are currently looking at, but all of them still require a large amount of work.

As I was originally due to fly to the US in the first week of December and fly back for Chistmas, I'm only really missing out on about 10 working days in EES.

Given the status of the ""work-out"" plan I do not want to leave EBS in it's current unfinished state. Potentially there is a $17m write/off and due to the lack of historic knowledge regarding EBS, I consider myself a key individual in minimising this exposure - I have spoken to Mike Jordan and he fully supports a Jan-02 being most beneficial to Enron as a whole.

Does this work for you ?

Thanks

Neil

"Merger Transition Teams","Mark,

While Enron's management teams are reviewing actions plans for the upcoming six to nine months, I understand that functional transition teams will be assembled to address the planned merger.  I would like to register my strong interest in assisting any transition team where my skills could add value. Prior to developing and supporting corporate as well as enterprise systems at Enron my career has spanned across General Electric Capital Services and ABB on a global basis. Much of this experience has included system integration and change management.  

Let me know if you have any questions to the above.  Otherwise, I wanted to let you know of my interest and desire in working towards a successful transition for Enron.

Dave, Dan and Jeremy:

As you can see from the below ""stacked"" e-mails we continue to have significant issues in our attempt to bill the Rexam account.  Service Management has had weekly meetings with  Billing on this account and yet this problem still persists.  While I am confident that Ben and Evan are aware of this issue we do not seem to have either the ability or the proper resources to bring it to a sucessful resolution.  

In addition to these issues on Rexam we have had a failure to follow through on a bill payment issue on a Tyco account that has caused us to not pay the utility bill for two months at the headquarters site.  This has been raised to our counterpart's attention at Tyco and though we have taken steps to resolve this event it has provided another data point in Tyco's mind as to our competency.  This is obviously happening at a important time in our negotiations.

Evan has acknowledged his accountability for building the procedures and processes that will allow us to successfully live up to our obligations in our contracts.

Craig,

This absolutely shocks me.  We really focused upon making the process
simple during the renegotiations and at last month's meeting we were
lead to believe that you had your hands around this.  For Jack to take this
much time and have so many errors is a totally non-value activity.

It certainly looks like the team from Enron needs more resources.  I'd
expect you to be prepared to explain at the monthly meeting in
Winston-Salem on the 8th what issues remain and specific action items
to resolve this problem in 2001.  We can not accept this as a go forward
process in 2002.  Is this too much to ask?




**********Below is the first e-mail.*************


Becky,

In retrospect, I wanted to comment on a few items from our meeting this
past Monday at your offices. I feel it is necessary to document what I still
perceive to be very poor performance on the invoice and account
management received from Enron. 

While I had low expectations for this particular invoice - especially due to
many of the new rules coming into play for the Second Amendment - we
still spent almost 5 hours reviewing, changing and correcting this
document. When you take into account that 2 of the 3 California plants
did not have electric invoices for us to review - and this is not Enron's
fault but PG&E's - the fact that this review took so long is not a good
sign. Ten of the twenty-one individual plant statements had some type of
error - and half of those were serious errors.

I am looking to see vast improvements in the future. I do not see us
stopping this monthly review process in the near future, and days like
Monday reinforce that thinking.

On another note, we spent close to an hour on the Natural Gas slip-up
with our Olive Branch Plant - which was inexcusable. I credit Enron for
doing the firefighting drill to reestablish nominations in time for the
November cutoff; however, the situation should have never been
allowed to spin out of control in the first place. I had to intercede with the
Energy Management representative to keep the nomination open beyond
noon to accommodate this oversight. I am looking to have Barry or Evan
provide me with an action plant to prevent his in the future.

Unfortunately, this allowed us little time to review open issues. I will
recap those we did review on future e-mails. Sometime today or
tomorrow, I will coordinate a time that we can then ""resume our meeting""
via phone.

Regards,
Jack Bender

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"Re: December Newsletter","Sally - Your work schedule - and environment - must be truly terrible right now.  Never having been through a merger/buyout, it's hard for me to comprehend the stress everyone must be feeling . . .
I did not get the article from Lori, just the Curfew Exempt form.  I'm sure a pull-out would be fine, if you could coordinate that with Sally Walker for printing and collating.  It doesn't look like Nancy got the download, and Janet couldn't read portions of it (funny how some fonts are not supported by the software), so I'm dropping a hard copy off at Nancy's in the morning when I take the car in to the dealership.  Fortunately, it's on the way!  My computer will be out of commission from Tuesday afternoon until sometime Thursday, so if there are changes it won't arrive in-home until a little later this time . . .
Good luck, and have good week!  Robin

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"RE: McKinsey, Staff Meeting and Budget Updates","You can help with McKinsey.  The only thing I can think of is them analyzing the size of the market for mid and back office services and how much capital is dumped in to this, etc.

On Whalley, we should be down 15% on 2002 plan vs. 2001 forecast across EA, EGM, EIM, EEL, EES, and Corp. (as a whole) on total expense (so EBIT is helped) and probably that much on capital as well so cash flow in 2002 is better and we don't keep making the depreciation snowball bigger.  The key will be having accurate 2001 forecast numbers!

Can I go with you when you see Causey just to sit in?  You can do it all, I just want to see how he feels about the whole thing.  Besides, I don't really know him well.

See you at 1:30 PM today until 4 PM, if necessary.

Subject:	McKinsey, Staff Meeting and Budget Updates

McKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  Todd Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.  


Staff Meeting Attendees:  Will Alan Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including Mark's directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, Alan mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or Alan announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start.  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with Mark in agreeing to the transition.)  

Budgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that Greg is trying to make.  Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some ideas on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.  --Sally

"RE: FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., EVP, FINANCE & TREASURER","Raymond

I am now in charge of what remains of the Operations function in London and we are co-ordinating payment of any employee expenses for Enron Europe employees, both current and those whose employment was terminated on 30 November (please refer to Philip Schumacher's email sent to you dated 14 December on this subject).

Because EEL and EPOL are not in Chapter 11 but are in Administration it would be helpful to review notes like yours below before they go out to ensure that, where they are addressed to ""All Enron Employees"", they do apply consistently across all Enron entities.

Please could you call me (+44 20 7783 5261) or email me to let me know whether your note below relates to Enron Europe employees.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

"RE: EES Weekly Status","Bill

This problem is stemming from the volume in Mass Market as you know.  As a result, significantly more new transactions are being booked to ""New Counterpart""  than can be cleaned up from historical deals.  As Credit has been emphasizing for some months now, this is not acceptable for this business, is not maintainable (proof in the attached report) and IT resources are required to automate current manual processes.

Global Counterparty is testing their new process to automate the set up of new counterparts in GCP such that the GCP ID may also be returned to EES in conjunction with our credit response prior to booking (expected delivery next Monday0.   However, the risk system batch process specifically for RPS must be enhanced to automatically create the counterpart and accept the GCP ID.  Efforts are finally underway to this end and are expected to be tested within the week.  Then, downstream processing through to billing may benefit.

Many lack the clear understanding that it has taken not only GCP to set up the counterpart in Global Counterpart but also Deal Capture to establish and map the counterpart in RPS and RGS (both have been manual procesess, the latter severly under resourced).  

Once this is implemented, EES has over 20,000 Mass Market transactions executed now, so efforts need to continue to clean up this backlog.  More importantly, three companies have already filed bankruptcy.  We must complete these efforts to manage the portfolio and respond to these events.

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

"RE: quarterly doorstep update - action requested","RAC is responsible for updating the database, but they must get info communicated from the action item owners to know what to update.  Shona and I oversee that process.

The purpose of circulating to the reviewers is so that we have the most updated info, and we encourage more updates before the presentation to Causey and Buy next week.

I am not sure I see what is wrong with pushing these guys to get more updates in.

Certainly, we would communicate with any process owner BEFORE presenting to Sr management, if we feel that a major finding has been overlooked, in order to get a better understanding of the status, and why there has not been progress, as a final back stop to ensure that the wrong info is not communicated.

I think we are getting together late tomorrow.  Happy to discuss then.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

"status of accrual books & risk","Dear Sally,

As we discussed on Thursday, I am putting together some discussion points for the individual risk groups regarding the receipt by credit of complete credit information.  Essentially, I am trying to determine how pervasive the problem is of credit not receiving accrual books with credit risk.  The probable reason for this is that certain books require accrual treatment for accounting purposes.  Once I hear from Debbie/Mark on the message below, I will start working with the individual risk groups.  

Regards

Subject:	accrual books

I've been thinking through credit's need for the forward values on 3rd party trades that are treated as accrual for accounting purposes.

I'm planning a meeting with the different risk heads to discuss the volume of transactions that fall into this category, but before I do that I need confirmation from you that I fully understand what you need the information for.  If you could, please confirm (or explain what I'm missing in my reasoning) the following in regards to forward values for third party trades treated as accrual for accounting purposes:

Margins - you do need these forward values for margining purposes.

Credit limit - you do need these forward values when determining total exposure per counterparty against their limits.

Analysis - Potential Exposure, margin liquidity, counterparty by curve - I think you would need these positions for your analyses.

Credit reserve - the value would not be needed for the credit reserve, as the purpose for the reserve is accounting related.  As these books are treated as accrual for accounting purposes, they should not be considered in the reserve.

Once I hear from you I'll work with the different BU's risk groups to see if there any problems with these types of books (problems such as them not being calced daily).  I'd like to meet with them early next week, so if you could get back to me as soon as you can, I'd really appreciate it.

Best regards

Shona

The following are consolidated DPR reporting & officialization requirements for the US Thanksgiving holiday which is Thursday, November 22 and Friday, November 23.  All US markets are closed Thursday, and NYMEX is closed Fri, but rate and currency markets are open Friday.

Wednesday's trading -
Consolidated DPR - will be prepared on Monday, the 26th
Officializations - no change to normal procedure

Thursday & Friday's trading - 
Consolidated DPR - since most markets are closed, there will be no consolidated DPR for these days. However, if there is trading; positions, VAR and P&L have to be reviewed against limits, separately from the activity of Wednesday's and Monday's trading.  
Officializations - This holiday marks a change to prior procedures due to an increased need for more complete info in RMS.  Ramesh (RAC IT) is going to run a job to copy Wednesday's numbers for Thursday and Friday for all groups for which he has not received books.  I had spoken to a few of you about performing this copy/roll manually.  This is now not required.

This memo should not affect EEL or IR/FX trading.

Please call if you have questions.

TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE
News from The University of Texas at Austin
NOVEMBER 2001
____________________________________________
Dear UT Friend:
We received many positive responses to last month's premier issue of TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE. Some readers' email software had problems with the logo header. We apologize if you were among that group and hope you enjoy this logo-free second issue. Look for the fall/winter printed edition of Texas Tribute in December, and another TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE in January.
Now, on to the news:
WHEN PROFESSOR EMERITUS JOHN J. MCKETTA was teaching, he would say to his students that he could visualize where they would be 15 years into the future. ""I'd tell them they were going to be presidents and vice presidents in industry,"" recalls the eminent chemical engineer and energy adviser to five U.S. presidents. His approach has encouraged and motivated countless incipient engineers in his 55 years at UT. One of those is Peter Buenz, a 1960 chemical engineering graduate who, with his wife Claire, has given $30,000 to endow a scholarship in honor of his mentor.--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/index.html
BEATING THE AGGIES is a reward unto itself, but one group of students is channeling its collective team spirit into a good cause. The UT Austin Army ROTC cadets will run the game football from the UT Tower to Kyle Field to raise money for the Pentagon Victims Fund, established in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack. Runners will leave the UT Tower the morning of Nov. 21, arriving at Texas A&M's Kyle Field in time for the Nov. 23 UT vs. A&M game. The Longhorn Victory Stampede will take the cadets along Highways 79 and 6 en route to College Station. Participants and donations are welcome.--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/depts/arotc/index.html
UNIVERSITY STAFF MEMBER ARTHUR RAUCH decided it was time to put his money where his mouth is. Rauch, a longtime counselor at the Learning Center, has made a bequest to UT that will create a $700,000 scholarship endowment for members of Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity he has served as campus adviser for more than 20 years. Rauch says he hopes his donation will provide an academic incentive for students, and that it also will serve as a catalyst for other alumni to make Greek-related scholarship gifts.--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/index.html
GO BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR to the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art to catch two dynamic exhibits. ""Past Present Future: Notions of Time in 20th-Century Art"" draws on the Blanton's renowned collections of American and Latin American art, focusing primarily on works created between 1915 and the early 1980s . Reaching further into the past, ""500 Years of Prints and Drawings"" features works on paper representing the 15th through 20th centuries. Both exhibits end December 30.--> SEE http://www.blantonmuseum.org/
SPEAKING OF THE END OF THE YEAR, it's almost here! If you're considering a year-end donation to the University, please remember that your gift must be received by Dec. 31 for a 2001 receipt to be generated. Also, you may have the opportunity to double or even triple your gift if your employer has a matching gift program. To ensure that UT receives the maximum benefit from your investment, ask your human resources office if a match is available.
For further news and information about UT Austin, visit our home page:--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/
As always, your feedback is both welcome and appreciated. Hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving holiday.

Hello Jeff,

My name is Rich Shane.  Steve suggested I contact you to see if you might be
able to direct me further within Enron.  My company, Digital Integrity, has
a solution for digital data discovery that enables an extremely fast method
to find a large variety of different digital files across an enterprise's
network and email system.

We provide a software solution that is ideally suited to performing
electronic discovery across vast collections of digital documents. The DI
solution allows users to perform discovery wherever their company's
documents might be located.  In addition to finding exact copies, our
solution can discover documents whether or not they have been modified.  In
other words, whether or not the documents have been excerpted or derived
from the original.

For example, we are able to find megabytes of email communication in
terabytes of email messages across a company's entire corporate network.
This can be used as an off-line audit / data mining application using
archived-messages or as an on-line filtering application using ""live"" (i.e.
outgoing and incoming) messages.  In addition to email, we work with word
processing, spreadsheet, presentation and many other types of documents. We
can show the percentage overlap between source documents and found
documents.  We can show the parts of a document that are similar and
dissimilar down to the word via a side-by-side comparison.  As previously
stated, we can find documents across a corporate network or even on the
Internet.

Attached is a product overview that will give you more information on how we
can help with Enron's data discovery, information security and intellectual
asset management needs.

If you would be willing to forward this message along to the relevant
people, I would be grateful.

All,

I have not yet gotten Don's employee information yet and am waiting until I can move everybody at one time so we have a clean cut-off for everyone.  If we have missed the May cut-off for an April 30 transition, we'll make it effective May 31.  Also, I am considering just making it effective June 30 so we have a clean quarter cut-off.  So, continue to use your current cost center until you hear back from me.

Also, Kerry, is the description of the cost centers standard (the ENW ENA)?  Will this be confusing to existing ENA descriptions?  Would it be better to call them ENA/EES or EWS/EES.

Thanks

Wade

"FW: Price Curves","Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

One of our potential buyers will be here at 9am on Thursday.  The scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule.  This is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive.	 I tried to put Ops first but it really doesn't make sense.	

This really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but I wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover.

Wes - they want to cover bank accounts and cash in detail.

Some time during the morning they want a tour of the facilities - I am arranging with Bill Donovan.

The legacy systems will require a little work, but they should allow queries based on transaction dates (volumes transacted during a given time period - RGS for gas and RPS for power).

Subject: Draft of Transition Services Agreement



At the request of Lance Schuler, I am attaching the most recent version of the draft Transition Services Agreement for the Template and Wind transactions.  This draft does not yet include a description of the IT consulting services that the estate will need from Netco, but I am expecting to get some input on this from Greg Piper today.  Please call if you have any questions.

"Settlements Management Reports","Sally

Thanks for all your time in Houston and I'd be delighted to continue discussions around commercialisation whenever you want.

As promised, please find attached examples of our monthly management reporting.  They are still evolving - at the moment they are missing aged debtors / creditors reporting (we should get in for June reporting once the function moves back into my area) and anything on Enron Credit.  However, comments and thoughts welcome!

Kind regards

Anna
