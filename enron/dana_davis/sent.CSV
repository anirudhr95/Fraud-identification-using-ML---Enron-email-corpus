Either today or Monday, I expect the NYISO to announce that it will be offering its 3-day Market Orientation Course in Houston December 11-13 at the Hyatt Regency. Enrollment will be limited to 150 people on an as-registered basis, so early registration is encouraged. The on-line registration process will be included in their announcement, which will be broadcast to the ISO's TIE list as well as put on their web site www.NYISO.com. Because Enron has previously sent people through this training course, the costs for Enron employees attending this training session will be $800.00 per person, rather than the normal $1,200.00 charge. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Your words have brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my heart.  I love you and miss you too but what encourages me is that I know God has us all in the palm of His hand. Your words have blessed and encouraged me to continue to seek Gods face in everything that I do. You know that it has been said then and I know that you have been hearing it now, time is too short, if not at hand for the coming of the Lord.  I'm just trying to get my house in order.  I love you like my sister and don't forget that.

You haven't called me about helping you with the house.  I told you that I would help you when you got ready.  Call me.

Love your sister,

Just wanted to say that I really miss you.  It saddens me that you are not

I'm not sure what to say, except:

"Hey Monte","I tried to add you to my MSN Instant Messenger service but Enron's email firewall has heightened it's security disabling me to log into outside email accounts.  Later after everything cools off and they ease up on the security we can use the instant messenger service. 

That church was a little slow compared to what I'm used too.  It might be due to the fact that they are an interracial congregation.  What is your friends name again that goes there?

Subject:	Global Accounting Compensation Survey

Several months ago a compensation survey was commissioned by Rick Causey to see how Enron's accounting compensation compared to our peers, with our main objective being to retain and attract the best possible talent.   The survey was comprehensive, including Fortune 100 companies and two big-5 accounting firms.  The results of the survey have highlighted that some of our salaries are below today's market. So ... we set out to fix that. 
We spent a significant amount of time looking at individual salaries benchmarked against the survey results of positions with similar responsibilities and experience levels.  Existing internal equity issues were also considered.
Early next week, we will contact everyone to discuss where your current salary falls in our new ranges. If your salary is going to be adjusted, we will communicate your new salary at that meeting. We will also give you your new Enron Wholesale Services - Financial Operations shirt ( yes.. we have changed our name back to Financial Operations). All salary adjustments will be effective September 1st. 
I know that this has been a busy and challenging year for everyone and is likely to remain that way for awhile. We have made tremendous progress toward our major goals this year of cleaning up our accounts, understanding our balance sheet, getting our arms around our cash flow, dealing with tremendous volume growth in trading and building timely and value-added management reporting products. I recognize and appreciate all of your efforts.

Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?  Give me a call please to let me know if there is anything else that I need to be doing at this time.

My Instant Messenger isn't working for some reason but all I wanted was to ask you do you listen to gospel music and what kind if you do?  Traditional or contemporary?

Don't think of it as ""dropped.""  This is a new six weeks.  Remember, I don't have a lot of grades at this point, so any zeros really bring down their grades.  Once she turns in her work, it will com up.  You will be getting a detailed report on Friday.

>>> ""Davis, Dana"" <Dana.Davis@ENRON.com> 10/09/01 04:07PM >>>
So you are telling me that her grade has dropped from 91 to 65?  Is this
due that paper not being turned in?

She currently has a 65.  I need her timeline paper and her ""7th grade""
questions.  Thanks!

Good Morning Mrs. Kobernick -

Just checking with you to see how Candis' day was today.  What is her
grade in your class as of today and did she ever turn that paper in that
she missed that day?  Thanks for keeping me informed.
