"RE: The Periwinkle Foundation Annual Fund Drive","Kelly,

I have not provided you with an updated list, so I hope you used my one from last year--it should suffice.

Also, please be advised, according to my duties as the Junior League's Outside Board Rep, I am not permitted to assist with any fund raising activities.  Therefore, I will attend the Board meeting, but will not stay to write notes.

Sorry,

Susan Bailey

Susan,

BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. was marked as a ""Y"" for termination on the latest Letter Log and Master Termination Log we received from Stephanie Panus....so do we include them in the list or not?  I was in the process of sending their list of deals over to Risk to be swung into the Bankruptcy books.  

Melissa - can you run this query for Power and send me a spreadsheet?  I'll merge it into whatever we find for Gas, Crude, Paper, Weather, etc...  for each counterparty?

Bob - can you do physical gas?  

Thanks,
Diane

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Credit Union Changes","What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

"Flexible Spending Accounts","Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

Craig,
Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two
companies.

Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo

HOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subject of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trader.

The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms.

""We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,"" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews&Kurth, one of the city's largest with about 240 lawyers in Houston.

Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle.

Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face possible bankruptcy.

Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent.

""My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,"" said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker&Botts, a law firm with about 265 lawyers in Houston.

In addition to Enron's in-house legal staff, the company also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

As discussed, set forth below is the list of the Non-Terminated Top Ten Counterparties, where Enron is In-The-Money.  First determine where if applicable in your respective confirm world whether the appropriate Enron affiliate has a (i) physical power, or (ii) financial power relationship with each of the counterparties listed.  If so, please furnish a listing that evidences the following requests:

	1.	Live Deals as of November 30, 2001

Also, please furnish a hard copy of all live confirmations under request #1 above.  

I beleive that Melissa has already furnished the physical power confirms for those mentioned above.  However, ask her if she has searched for financial power deals.

If not we will need these for any of the above-mentioned.

Louis,

Cynthia says Select Energy sent the funds in question to the wrong bank account (Corp acct).  Cynthia will create a journal entry to clear these items.
Please disregard Select Energy invoices on the AR Redlist Co 364.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Clement,

Brent Hendry has been working on an Enron Corp Guaranty, which would guarantee the physical and financial trading obligations of various Enron affiliates with that of various Duke affiliates.

Attached for your review are Duke's comments to the proposed Guaranty.  For your viewing convenience, the attached document has been prepared in a ""redlined"" format, which tracks Duke's changes in a red font.    Please note, ENA has upgraded its form of Guaranty and those changes appear in a red boldfaced font.

Please let me know which changes you will or will not approve.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Yes, all the documents were provided to E&Y in hard copy form in the binders delivered to Raj last week.  The only document not included was the Florida Power & Light Company (""FPL"") agreement.   However, under the EWS-CCT address you now possess all the Master Netting Agreements (including the FPL agreement) in the electronic/pdf format.

As in our past exercises for the ""Non-Terminated/In-the-Money"" Counterparties, the Thiele-Kaolin Company continues to appear as a ""financial"" trading relationship.

However, according to the Confirmation Desk there are only physical arrangements with this counterparty (as evidenced by our GTC docs).  I hope that Credit can resolve the mystery???

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

"RE: Cash Flow -- Sciullo Entities","Dan,

I agree as to your decision to complete the reimbursment for cell phones for year 2001.

However, I will NOT use the Four Star card for gasoline purchases any longer, since Mr. D was opposed to this practice.

Hey -- have a HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

Love you.

Subject: Re: Cash Flow -- Sciullo Entities


I hear you Susan, but that is nickels and dimes.  In the scheme of things it is small. I think we should at least reiburse ourselves for phones etc through 12/31/01.  Otherwise, we lose two ways: (1) we don't get the money back and (2) the amounts are not deductible by anyone. We need to keep our eyes on taxes deuctions too. So that is my view.

>>> ""Bailey, Susan"" <Susan.Bailey@ENRON.com> 11/16/01 09:23 AM >>>

Dan,

I have reviewed your (as always through) summary of events, as well as
having reviewed the cash flow ledgers.  With respect to the saving of
funds -- I would suggest that you & I no longer charge our gasoline
usage to Four Star, nor reimburse ourselves for our cell phone usage.

As you know, Mr. Donato did not approve of the gasoline charges w/ the
Four Star credit card, especially in light of the fact that Four Star
does not own either of our cars/vehicles.

Let me know about the gasoline and cell phone thoughts.

Love you.

"Weekend","
Dona,

It has just dawned on me that I never got back to confirm which day this weekend we should rendevous.   I know that David will be out of town hunting and that you had proposed Friday -- drinks or Sat./Sun.

If you have not made plans for Friday, I thought that would be fun to have a little happy hour--that would give me reason to leave early on Friday.

If thats not good, then Sat. or Sun . will work.

Look forward to your response.

I just talked to Allison and Strawnie is out of ICU and in his own room. 
 He is still heavily sedated, but doing much better.  They are doing 
surgery on his arm and hand (left) tomorrow to close it up.  He will have 
to have more surgery when he gets home.  They are hoping to come home 
Monday evening if all continues to go well.  I asked her about phone calls 
to Strawnie and she said as soon as he is able to talk on the phone, he 
will call me.  So I will let you all know as soon as I hear from him.

will keep them at the nurses' station until he goes into his own room.   He 
can receive balloons though.

He is in ICU, Pod D

"Update on Retention & Severance Plan","
We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Clement,

Brent Hendry has been working on an Enron Corp Guaranty, which would guarantee the physical and financial trading obligations of various Enron affiliates with that of various Duke affiliates.

Attached for your review are Duke's comments to the proposed Guaranty.  For your viewing convenience, the attached document has been prepared in a ""redlined"" format, which tracks Duke's changes in a red font.    Please note, ENA has upgraded its form of Guaranty and those changes appear in a red boldfaced font.

Please let me know which changes you will or will not approve.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Darren,

ENA and Forest Oil have entered into 5 trades, which have all been confirmed under an Omnibus Confirmation format.  All 5 trades did not include any credit provisions; however, Forest Oil has sent back comments -- some of which are of a credit nature.

Therefore, please advise as to your call on the following Credit requests:

	1.	Enron Corp. Guaranty to be provided to guarantee ENA's obligations under the trades.
	2.	Events of Default re: Bankruptcy -- change Section 3(d)'s reference of 30 days to 60 days.

Let me know your thoughts.

Subject:	Mirant Canada's purchase of TransCanada Pipelines trading business

On October 11, Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. purchased a substantial portion of TransCanada Pipeline's trading and marketing business. As a result, Mirant will be purchasing the entire business of TransCanada Energy Financial Products Limited, and will be taking assignment of the physical gas transactions/contracts of TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd.

As a result of this transaction, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. will be terminating whatever credit support they provided for these entities and that credit support will be picked up by Mirant Corp, depending on the arrangements that we have negotiated. With respect to TransCanada Energy Financial Products Limited, it was agreed that the ISDA that is currently between Enron Canada Corp. and TransCanada Energy Financial Products Limited will be assigned to Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd under the same credit terms as currently exist.  Mirant Corp will issue a $30 million USD guaranty to provide the credit support for this document, the same dollar amount that TransCanada Pipelines Ltd was providing.  They have also agreed to provide whatever necessary collateral to cover their exposure, over the threshold, as a result of their purchasing this entity.

With respect to TransCanada Gas Services Inc., the only outstanding gas transactions are with Enron North America and these all relate to physical product. There is no contract between TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and Enron North America, but TCPL is currently providing a guaranty for this business. This guaranty will be terminated, and these transactions will be covered under a current Mirant Corp guaranty covering Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. for physical gas transactions with Enron North America. This current guaranty is for USD $10 million and is of a sufficient amount to cover the current exposure as well as the exposure being brought over from TransCanada Gas Services Inc..

Finally, with respect to TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd, there is currently a physical gas master with Enron Canada Corp. However, this was executed in 1993 and is outdated with respect to credit provisions. I have been working with the credit contact at Mirant Canada to get a new physical master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. This new master would govern all existing trades between ECC and Mirant Canada, as well as those coming over from TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd. However, in the interim, the TransCanada trades would still be covered by the existing master. TransCanada Pipelines will terminate their guaranty of this entity with respect to these transactions.  Alternatively, Mirant Corp has agreed to amend their existing guaranty covering physical gas transactions between Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. and Enron Canada Corp by increasing the coverage from USD $30 million to USD $50 million. This entity also has some exposure with Enron North America, which will also be covered under the existing Mirant Corp. guaranty for USD $10 million.

A contract between ENA and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. would also be an ideal outcome out of this; however, the first priority is getting a new physical gas master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd.

If there is any other information that I can provide on this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks

"Demand Letters","Recall that you provided invoices for the purpose of attachments to demand letters for live non-pay CPs.  The letters have begun to go out.  I suspect some CPs will notify us of their intention to either 1) pay or 2) not-pay based upon some specific grounds.  For those CPs that don't respond at all as well as those who indicate that they will pay, I need to know who we should contact to determine weather payment was received.  

Please provide a contact person for this task.

All, 

I have confirmed that the following invoices for Williams Production RMT Company (""Williams""), were sent under ENA's Demand Letter dated March 1, 2002:

			Invoice Nos. 	020168809
					0202142
					020169166
					01121094
					01121761

Please note, the only Invoice not included with ENA's Demand Letter to Williams was:   0203094.  Therefore, advise as to whether this invoice also relates to Williams and why it was not included with ENA's letter of March 1st.

Further, please advise if the $7,686.87 interest check relates to all the invoices, including Invoice #0203094.

Thanks.

Subject:	Bin Laden



The following was received from a friend:

Most of us remember the Oliver North hearings, but do not recall the name
of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist that North was threatened by. It's
pretty evident in hindsight that we should have listened to Ollie!
In a recent university lecture the other day they played a video of
Oliver North during the Iran-Contra deals during the Reagan
administration.

There was Ollie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But
what he said was stunning. He was being grilled by some senator who asked
him; 'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security
system?'

Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'

The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't
this just a little excessive?'

'No sir,' continued Oliver.

'No. And why not?'

'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'

'Threatened? By who.'

'By a terrorist, sir.'

'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'

'His name is Osama bin Laden.'

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt and then the senator continued.
'Why are you so afraid of this man?'

'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'

'And what do you recommend we do about him?'

'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate
him and his men from the face of the earth.' The senator disagreed with
this approach and that was the end of the video clip.

It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama
bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess
like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like
the virus they truly are.""

"Power Outage at Enron Building","
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Edward, 

Attached is 4th part.  This is the final part.

By receipt of this transmission, you are now in possession of all the electonic/pdf formatted Master Netting Agreements, which were included in the binder delivered to Raj last week.  

One note of clarification -- I have provided the electronic/pdf version of the Florida Power & Light Company agreement.  However, at the time the binder was delivered this agreement had not come my way; therefore, it is not included in the current binder is scheduled to be included a supplemental binder.

Please advise if I may be of further assistance.

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

Have you got any master agreements or other netting agreements in the US between Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc and ECTRIC (Enron Capital & Trade Resources Inc)?  

If so please fax me a copy and email me to say it's on its way.

For the one deal you mentioned, YA8712.1, it was ""released"" by Darren in Credit without 
any credit terms on 10/18.    Regarding the other handwritten deal numbers on that cover page, I 
believe are older (Aug or earlier) - and I only keep our credit emails a couple of months, so 
I don't know who released those - but none of them went out with credit provisions.   

I guess you should start with Darren.

Edward,

I thought I noticed a Senior designation and thought it kind of strange.  

Yes, all the documents were provided to E&Y in hard copy form in the binders delivered to Raj last week.  The only document not included was the Florida Power & Light Company (""FPL"") agreement.   However, under the EWS-CCT address you now possess all the Master Netting Agreements (including the FPL agreement) in the electronic/pdf format.    

If you want to present E&Y with the electronic/pdf versions, you will need to do that.

How are we handling this type of issue? Are we sending them a letter indicating that they still have to pay for gas we have already delivered? Are we reading the contracts on a one-off basis to determine our rights? This is probably our largest gas deal with the biggest receivable $$ in the door - and also big in the money MTM from our perspective.

Bryce,

I spoke with Scott Borgmeyer of Florida Power and Light and FPL Energy Power Mktg.
concerning their payments that are due on December 17th and December 26th.
 According to Scott, they will not be making payments to us on these days due to the termination 
of their contract effective December 12th.  They will not be paying at this time due to unwinding 
arrangements of terminated contracts.  Payment amounts due are as follows:

December 17th	$21,064,010.57  FP&L

December 26th  $ 6,965,765.30   FP&L

December 26th  $     22,077.24   FPL Energy Power Marketing

Thanks,

Max

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Attached for your review are Duke's comments to the proposed Guaranty.  For your viewing convenience, the attached document has been prepared in a ""redlined"" format, which tracks Duke's changes in a red font.    Please note, ENA has upgraded its form of Guaranty and those changes appear in a red boldfaced font.

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  

To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated.

"Master Logs (Part 1 - Message) (Part II -- Master Logs)","
Mary Nell & Ted,

As discussed, attached is an individual ""Master Log"" for: (a) ECTRIC, (b) EFET/EEFTL, and (c) Enron Credit Limited/Enron Credit Inc.  Each Master Log was based on Houston's Termination Log as of 2-11-02. 

In reviewing the respective Master Logs you will notice that:

(a)	the attached Master Logs include some of the same entries -- because the termination letter may have related to various Enron affiliates; 

(b)	each of the attached Master Logs includes some counterparties also represented on the London Log entitled ""Schedule of Claims"" - because in many cases the Enron entity was not identified in the London Log; and  

(c)	 the following Tab Numbers (being the number that appears in the London Log) represent those counterparties which appear as a counterparty entry in one or more of the attached Master Logs and those counterparty entries on the London Log need to be identified with one or more of the attached Master Logs: 

					Tab No.
					1-3
					5-8
					14-16B
					19
					21& 22
					27 &28
					31-40
					41 (Nordea Bank Finland Plc)
					42
					44
					47-50
					52-54
					72
					79-84
					88-90
					99
					106
					109
					116

You are receiving all notices relating to the U.K. Enron entities and can update/maintain the attached Master Logs accordingly.

Please let me or Sara know if you have any questions  or need additional assistance.

Paul,

Both ENA and ECTRIC have a master agreement in place with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc., as follows:

	1.	ENA's is Master Agreement dated effective as of June 16, 1992, and which has been amended over time.

	2.	ECTRIC's is an ISDA Master Agreement dated effective as of August 29, 1997.

As for your inquiry concerning nettting agreements -- Morgan Stanley has no master netting arrangements with either ENA or ECTRIC.

Hard copies of the aformentioned agreements will be faxed to you today.

Have you got any master agreements or other netting agreements in the US between Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc and ECTRIC (Enron Capital & Trade Resources Inc)?

I have yet to compile these agreements into a binder, as they were not organized upon my receipt.

I will provide copies of the agreements to you shortly.

I have left Tom Moran a voice-mail and hope to hear from him today -- so we can confirm that we have all pre-petition mutual terminations.

"RE: assignment","Craig,

Brent has reviewed the Assignment and suggests that we use the ENA form of Assignment.  Reason being -- the last B of A deal (when using their document), which involved a similar scenario was abit confusing.

Brent said our form will be with PCS as assignor rather than ENA.  
However, before we can finalize -- Credit must approve.

Jay,

Please advise if assignment of PCS deals are OK with Credit.

PCS Nitrogen would like to assign their positions with Enron over to Bank of America.  The structure of the deal would be for B of A to step in between Enron and PCS.  Currently, PCS is out of the money to Enron.  This trade would lower B of A's exposure to Enron.    I would like to give an answer to PCS today.  Could you please review and let me know how we proceed o n this assignment.

Craig,
Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two
companies.

"Intercompany Transactions","Bart,

I have saved the document in the O:Drive, in the ""_Dropbox"" folder.  It's not in any sub-folder, so look for it at the end with other documents.  It's called 1TAGG & DCAF All Internal 120101-123142.  It is password protected so nobody can change data.  Call me for the password, or you can view it as read only.  It will automatically be deleted from the Dropbox in seven days.  If you are concerned that anyone else should find and read it, save it and then delete it from the O:Drive.

The first sheet [Intercompany Transactions] was compiled using reports from DCAF (shown in red; contains physical gas transactions only) and TAGG (shown in black; contains all commodities), along with a report from Global Contracts (shown in blue; I have gas and financial access only).  Data shown in green was obtained from specific deals in Sitara.

The second sheet shows intercompany contracts which still need to be matched up with deals on the first sheet.  TAGG does not show me which contract covered which transaction, so I will make certain assumptions.  I will let you know as I make updates, and please let me know if this is still not what you need.  As I told you before, there are entries which look like one month deals that are long overwith, but are actually parts (legs) of deals that included 12/01/01, and were picked up based on some link I can't identify.  I'm still trying to figure that part out, too.  Any suggestions are appreciated.

If you have questions please give me a call at 5-9989.

"RE: Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc. (""Tri-State"")","Maria Garza and I checked.  We only see the two trades (TAGG numbers) you reference, none other.  It is our opinion that these trades represent all of the financial GAS positions.  Note that these two trades ended w/ the Feb02 settlement period.

I cannot speak to power or any other commodity.  However, I can provide that Credit Agg didn't show any position exposure for Tri State, which we think is consistent considering there is no existing forward [gas] market price exposure to Tri State.

In summary, my opinion is that there are no other positions.  However, only Beth Apollo's group can provide a conclusive answer.  Hope this helps.

Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo

HOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subject of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trader.

The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms.

""We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,"" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews&Kurth, one of the city's largest with about 240 lawyers in Houston.

Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle.

Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face possible bankruptcy.

Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent.

""My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,"" said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker&Botts, a law firm with about 265 lawyers in Houston.

In addition to Enron's in-house legal staff, the company also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years.

Reliant has agreed to sell us gas on Florida.  My trading contact is Jim Taylor (713-207-1482).  The contact on the wire should be Pete Torres (713-207-1471), he is in Reliant's credit department.  Pete said there should be an active GISB contract with Reliant already in place.  I would like to prepay for 5 days and I have my calculation on the prepay request form. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Baltimore Gas & Electric Company","I spoke w/ Brian Russo today to determine whether he sent payment as he indicated on 3/13/02.  He admitted that BG&E dropped the ball and would get the payment via wire to ENA tomorrow.  He also said there are a few invoices wherein ENA owes BG&E.  If they are all post-petition he is planning to net the amounts.

I provided Brian w/ wire instructions.  

Brian again stated he is willing to pay default interest when the rate is provided.  That issue is in my court.

I have entered the requested information relating to termination letters -- however, Whirlpool Corporation was not in default @ the time that the first batch of Demand Letters were sent out.  Therefore, we would not yet be sending them a Termination Letter.

In light of the foregoing, I guess if they are in default???? Should they now receive a Demand Letter????

Subject:	Termination Letters Sent 3/8/02 -DRAFT-

We are in the process of determining which demand letter recipients will receive termination letters today.  Several CPs have outstanding issues which we are investigating (largely claims that the amounts due have already been paid).  Based on current information, we will send termination notice to the following CPs.  Their MTM value is included, as this amount will shift from ""live"" to ""terminated.""

Counterparty			$MTM (millions)
-----------------------------		-------
Johns Manville Int'l.		$8.6
Kerr-McGee En. Servs. Corp.	$3.6
Virginia Power			$9.3
Whirlpool Corp.			$0.2
	Total			$21.7

Please note that this list may change over the course of the day as we continue our research and issue resolution on each CP.  Additionally, the MTM values may be different once the positions are valued at the appropriate termination date.

Don, the above is slightly different from the CPs I provided verbally earlier today.

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Louis,

I have entered into the Demand Log the cash payment information for the counterparties listed below.

I have one question:

	According to the Cash Flow report -- the payment is noted from ""Williams Energy Services Company"", do we know for a fact that the monies relate to ENA's relationship with Williams Production RMT????

San Diego Gas & Electric on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount
Stone Energy Corporation on 3/6/02 for the full demand letter amount

Please update the Demand Letter Log to reflect that their payment was received.  No termination letter will go to these CPs at this time.

All, 

I have confirmed that the following invoices for Williams Production RMT Company (""Williams""), were sent under ENA's Demand Letter dated March 1, 2002:

			Invoice Nos. 	020168809
					0202142
					020169166
					01121094
					01121761

Please note, the only Invoice not included with ENA's Demand Letter to Williams was:   0203094.  Therefore, advise as to whether this invoice also relates to Williams and why it was not included with ENA's letter of March 1st.

Further, please advise if the $7,686.87 interest check relates to all the invoices, including Invoice #0203094.

Edward, 

Attached is 4th part.  This is the final part.

By receipt of this transmission, you are now in possession of all the electonic/pdf formatted Master Netting Agreements, which were included in the binder delivered to Raj last week.  

One note of clarification -- I have provided the electronic/pdf version of the Florida Power & Light Company agreement.  However, at the time the binder was delivered this agreement had not come my way; therefore, it is not included in the current binder is scheduled to be included a supplemental binder.

Please advise if I may be of further assistance.

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Diane,

I too noted that BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. had terminated by mutual termination; however, include them on your list for the time being.

Thanks.

FYI:  thanks for including Melissa -- I had sent her a separate email as we had spoken over the phone concerning the project request.

Susan,

BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. was marked as a ""Y"" for termination on the latest Letter Log and Master Termination Log we received from Stephanie Panus....so do we include them in the list or not?  I was in the process of sending their list of deals over to Risk to be swung into the Bankruptcy books.  

Melissa - can you run this query for Power and send me a spreadsheet?  I'll merge it into whatever we find for Gas, Crude, Paper, Weather, etc...  for each counterparty?

Bob - can you do physical gas?  

Thanks,
Diane

Bob and Sarah,

Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.

Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Attached below is an Omnibus Confirm worksheet for BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.   Please prepare the appropriate annexes and forward to the financial confirmations group as soon as possible.

 << File: BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1 Omnibus Confirmation.xls >> 



Financial Confirms -

Upon receipt of the credit annexes from Legal, please send out confirms for the following trades:

YJ4705.1		YJ7870.1
YJ4707.1		YJ7870.2

Please note that these trades are currently booked to BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P.  This is, obviously, not the correct counterparty name.  Please correct and send confirmations at your earliest convenience.




Derek and George -
 
I have Global Counterparty setting up this new entity in our systems.  Please ensure that these trades get moved from BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P. to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  Margin calculations are dependent on these trades being booked correctly.  While Mike Larsen has been very accomodating, our margin team can not afford to spend time reconciling trades at the present.



Thanks to all for your help.

As discussed, attached is an individual ""Master Log"" for: (a) ECTRIC, (b) EFET/EEFTL, and (c) Enron Credit Limited/Enron Credit Inc.  Each Master Log was based on Houston's Termination Log as of 2-11-02. 

                  

In reviewing the respective Master Logs you will notice that:

(a)	the attached Master Logs include some of the same entries -- because the termination letter may have related to various Enron affiliates; 

(b)	each of the attached Master Logs includes some counterparties also represented on the London Log entitled ""Schedule of Claims"" - because in many cases the Enron entity was not identified in the London Log; and  

(c)	 the following Tab Numbers (being the number that appears in the London Log) represent those counterparties which appear as a counterparty entry in one or more of the attached Master Logs and those counterparty entries on the London Log need to be identified with one or more of the attached Master Logs: 

					Tab No.

Re: Stephen & Susan Bailey 2001 Tax Return

Dear Clint,
I am sending over to you today our tax organizer and supporting 
documentation. I am including a copy of this email in the front of the 
packet. Sorry for the delay but I had some difficulty rounding up 
documentation on a real estate transaction that needs to be addressed. In 
any event, we are still going to need an extension to file because Susan is 
awaiting tax information from Lincoln National Life Insurance as indicated 
on the enclosed schedule. I also need to discuss with you some issues 
regarding the sale of some family trust real estate (Washington County 
property) which probably needs to be characterized as capital gain to me. 
In particular, I had to purchase an adjoining tract a couple of years ago 
(The Emmerich Tract) to facilitate the sale of my interest in the entire 
acreage. The closing papers and related correspondence concerning both the 
Emmerich Tract purchase and sale of the Washington County property are 
enclosed. I have assumed that the acquisition costs of the Emmerich tract 
in 1998 (which was subsequently included in the sale of my interest in the 
Washington County property in 2001) is subtracted from my portion of the 
net proceeds from the 2001 sale for capital gains purposes. In any event, 
assuming the sale is capital gain, we took stock losses that should offset 
a substantial part of it. By my rough calculation, the net gain on the sale 
of the real estate (after deducting the acquisition cost of the Emmerich 
tract) is approximately $26,000 and we had stock sale losses of 
approximately $19,000. My salary increased somewhat and Susan's stayed 
about he same during 2001; but we also had a substantially larger share of 
interest/ taxes on our home which was purchased in mid-2000. So, I'm not 
sure where we'll come out as compared to last year's taxes but I'd feel 
comfortable paying what we did last year as an estimate unless you think 
otherwise. Please let me know and, once again, sorry for the delay in 
forwarding this to you. Thanks,

Steve Bailey

P.S. On personal note, I hope you are doing well after such an 
extraordinary past year. Susan is still at Enron and its been interesting. 
I've been glad to see 2001 go by the wayside. Talk soon. SRB

Susan: My bad!  Maybe the payment combines two Williams entities and that would explain why they amount exceeds our invoice amount.

Shielah: Angelo gave me your name as a contact that could help with regard to cash inflows.  Please provide detail about the cash inflow from Williams on 3/5/02.  Specifically, which Williams company(s) provided the payment?  Thanks

Louis,

I have entered into the Demand Log the cash payment information for the counterparties listed below.

I have one question:

	According to the Cash Flow report -- the payment is noted from ""Williams Energy Services Company"", do we know for a fact that the monies relate to ENA's relationship with Williams Production RMT????

"Sciullo Properties -- Appraisal","
Leonard,

WELCOME BACK !!!!!   Hope you and Dorothy had a pleasant trip to Germany???   Hope all is well with Kasie??? I would love to hear all about it.

While you were gone, Maria Pirro contacted me -- she is with West Penn Appraisers, Inc. (""WPA"").  She faxed their fee schedule relating to the various Sciullo Properties and signed off on my approval as to costs, so WPA is beginning their work.

FYI:	I have sent to WPA the monies for the Burger King appraisal as well as the Willow Farms lots.  However, there are some properties for which Four Star or Dan & I are not a party to.   Therefore, the payment of those appraisals must be handled probably by you or my Dad.

I will fax the WPA fee Schedule, so you know what properties constitute WPA's idea of the ""Sciullo Properties"".

Once again, welcome back.

5.	Reliant

 

By receipt of this transmission, you are now in possession of all the electonic/pdf formatted Master Netting Agreements, which were included in the binder delivered to Raj last week.  

One note of clarification -- I have provided the electronic/pdf version of the Florida Power & Light Company agreement.  However, at the time the binder was delivered this agreement had not come my way; therefore, it is not included in the current binder is scheduled to be included a supplemental binder.

"Bin Laden","

The following was received from a friend:

Most of us remember the Oliver North hearings, but do not recall the name
of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist that North was threatened by. It's
pretty evident in hindsight that we should have listened to Ollie!
In a recent university lecture the other day they played a video of
Oliver North during the Iran-Contra deals during the Reagan
administration.

There was Ollie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But
what he said was stunning. He was being grilled by some senator who asked
him; 'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security
system?'

Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'

The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't
this just a little excessive?'

'No sir,' continued Oliver.

'No. And why not?'

'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'

'Threatened? By who.'

'By a terrorist, sir.'

'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'

'His name is Osama bin Laden.'

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt and then the senator continued.
'Why are you so afraid of this man?'

'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'

'And what do you recommend we do about him?'

'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate
him and his men from the face of the earth.' The senator disagreed with
this approach and that was the end of the video clip.

It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama
bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess
like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like
the virus they truly are.""

Zakiyyah -

I think I know the answer to this question, but here goes anyway:  I have started my review of the deal.  In the termination letter, Otter Trail references a letter from OT to EPMI dated 11/30/01 and discusses a possible reservation of rights based on that letter.  Do you have a copy of that letter?  If so, please forward.

Thanks.

Mark

Reliant has agreed to sell us gas on Florida.  My trading contact is Jim Taylor (713-207-1482).  The contact on the wire should be Pete Torres (713-207-1471), he is in Reliant's credit department.  Pete said there should be an active GISB contract with Reliant already in place.  I would like to prepay for 5 days and I have my calculation on the prepay request form. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cutiest,

Sorry for my absence -- but we have both been extremely busy lately with all the meetings going on.  However, I just wanted you to know that you are always in my thoughts, even though we may not see each other.

I have wanted to contact you for days, but there was never a free or good moment.  Most of my group is gone this afternoon, so I had a chance to drop a line and check on  how you are fairing.

I have received the news on the Boss and hope you are being taken care of -- since you have been a team for almost 25 years.    Please lets not lose touch -- you & I have shared many good & bad times together and I do not want to lose my only ""sister"".

Love you,

As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks

"Select Energy and Stone Energy Corporation","(1)  Received a voice mail from Bill O'Brien (credit manager) of Select Energy at 860-665-2376.

He says that payments were previously made on the referenced invoices and he is pulling the data together.  He wants to talk on Thursday.  Louis, can you call him please?

(2)  Received a demand letter from Stone Energy Corporation which cites ENA's (i) failure to pay Stone $46,564 under the swap EV3943.1 which will be a default in 2 business days, and (ii) bankruptcy.  Stone may later designate an Early Termination Date.

Stone will also offset amounts owed by ENA Upstream Company to Stone.

Louis:  we need to verify the swap payment issue and I'll have a copy of the letter sent to you.

"Discussion with John Miller re Willow Farms","Background

As you may remember, in September John Miller called to find out if we want to sell Willow Farms.  At that time, I told him I would find out from the group.

In December, he called again, and we missed one another, but I finally told, via voicemail, that we would entertain and consider and offer to buy Willow Farms but that we would not consider any kind of partnership or joint venture and we wanted a straight sale.  I then told him that if he was still interested that he should give it his best shot, and we would consider whatever he sent us.

My Discussion of 1/30/02

John called me back on 1/17/02, and I returned his call today.  I told John the following:

1.  The group is still interested in whatever he would propose, but I wanted to make some things clear so he didn't think we were wasting his time.

2.  I told him that in reality, all don't want to sell, but 2 out of 3 do, and I won't stand in the way of a satisfactory sale.

3.  We still do not want to participate in any development or sale, the price cannot be dependent on success of sales and a sale must be all or nothing.  I told him that I could not agree to any sale that allowed a ""cherry picking"" of good lots and left other lots behind, because once sales started it puts pressure to complete the development or else all prices suffer under perception of ""undesirable"" development.

4.  I told him that the only reason we are having this discussion now is that due to the property tax revaluations the carrying costs of the lots has increased.  Therefore, any sale must be structured to take that carrying cost pressure off, hence, a sale of all or nothing.

After stating these ground rules, I told him that I would understand if he wasn't interested, but that if he was, he should just give us his ""best"" proposal.

He then asked how many lots, and I told him 8 with a 9th possible, but owned only by my mom.  He said let's keep that out for now.  I also told him that within the next 2 years, the lot with the house might also be sold, but that that was up to my parents.

He then said the following:

1.  He is interested too in reducing his risk, so he might be interested in deal where he would guarantee the purchase of 2 lots every year for 4 years.  It would be a guarantee.

2.  He asked me if we had any idea of the value we wanted for the lots.  I said there are different ideas and no consensus, so I said I had no number to give him.  I reiterated to him that he knows more than me (since I'm just a lawyer in Denver) and he should give it his best shot.

I then commented to him on his suggestion:

1.  I told him that any deal that did not ensure sale of all lots was just not acceptable, so the extent of his guarantee of 2 lots per year had to be firm as to 8 lots over 4 years to even be considered.  I told him then it would appear just to be a means of financing the sale (not reducing his risk) and allowing us to keep title to the unsold lots rather than tie them up with a mortgage.

2.  I told him that his proposal may not be worth considering if it allowed the kind of cherry picking I referred to above and the kind of pressure to pick up the remaining lots at lower prices that I referred to above. I told him to consider these concerns in his proposal.

3.  I told him that because what brought us to the table now is the increased carrying costs of the lots, any proposal by him that still puts pressure on us to carry these lots and expend finds, will not be well received.  For example, I told him that I have some concern that any 2 lot per year deal will result in immediately increased carrying costs resulting from revaluation of the remaining lots for property tax purposes based upon the first purchases.  I told him that that would not be well received by us.

How We Ended It

I told him that I wanted to make clear my concerns so that he doesn't waste his time and feel resentful if we reject his offer. I told him that I wanted to be above board and that my reputation was important to me. He said he understood and appreciated the details.

He said he will put a proposal together, and I told him to send it to Leonard at the office, since I am not good at being the middleman.

Let me know if I goofed up or did ok.

"Noble Gas Marketing Inc","I talked w/ Ed McMichael about Noble WRT rescinding our termination if Noble were willing to pay in full all amounts due.  Ed said he would rather cause the position to be terminated (moving the approximately $40M MTM value out of the ""live"" status) than he would collect the $39M of outstanding invoices.  Ed's rationale is that any amounts settled (invoiced) will ultimately be collected in full w/ interest so there's no need to continue to wear the $40M MTM risk.

Therefore, I will let our termination letter stand as issued and do not plan to contact Noble.

Susan: please be sure to note that the termination letter was sent 3/11/02.

I have entered the requested information relating to termination letters -- however, Whirlpool Corporation was not in default @ the time that the first batch of Demand Letters were sent out.  Therefore, we would not yet be sending them a Termination Letter.

Subject:	Termination Letters Sent 3/8/02 -DRAFT-

We are in the process of determining which demand letter recipients will receive termination letters today.  Several CPs have outstanding issues which we are investigating (largely claims that the amounts due have already been paid).  Based on current information, we will send termination notice to the following CPs.  Their MTM value is included, as this amount will shift from ""live"" to ""terminated.""

Counterparty			$MTM (millions)
-----------------------------		-------
Johns Manville Int'l.		$8.6
Kerr-McGee En. Servs. Corp.	$3.6
Virginia Power			$9.3
Whirlpool Corp.			$0.2
	Total			$21.7

Please note that this list may change over the course of the day as we continue our research and issue resolution on each CP.  Additionally, the MTM values may be different once the positions are valued at the appropriate termination date.

Don, the above is slightly different from the CPs I provided verbally earlier today.

Talked to Bill O'Brien today.  He contends that Select made required payments, with the exception of some holdbacks which were clearly documented and provided to Enron.  Select wants to perform under the contract until that time we can mutually negotiate an early termination.  He is faxing 26 pages of information which supports Select's previous payments.

Bill requests that Enron:
q	Provide current written payment instructions
q	If we cannot resolve the payment dispute tomorrow (demand letter deadline), rescind the demand letter w/ rights to reopen after analysis is complete
q	Have Enron's attorney contact Select's attorney (see fax cover sheet for contact information)

Bill expressed concern that Enron would send a termination notice tomorrow (3/8/02) prior to resolution of the payment dispute.  I assured him that our intention was to resolve the payment issue if possible, reserving that we might agree to differ if resolution isn't possible.

"Termination Letters Sent 3/8/02 -DRAFT-","We are in the process of determining which demand letter recipients will receive termination letters today.  Several CPs have outstanding issues which we are investigating (largely claims that the amounts due have already been paid).  Based on current information, we will send termination notice to the following CPs.  Their MTM value is included, as this amount will shift from ""live"" to ""terminated.""

Counterparty			$MTM (millions)
-----------------------------		-------
Johns Manville Int'l.		$8.6
Kerr-McGee En. Servs. Corp.	$3.6
Virginia Power			$9.3
Whirlpool Corp.			$0.2
	Total			$21.7

Please note that this list may change over the course of the day as we continue our research and issue resolution on each CP.  Additionally, the MTM values may be different once the positions are valued at the appropriate termination date.

Don, the above is slightly different from the CPs I provided verbally earlier today.
