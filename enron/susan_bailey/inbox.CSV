"FW: assignment","
PCS Nitrogen would like to assign their positions with Enron over to Bank of America.  The structure of the deal would be for B of A to step in between Enron and PCS.  Currently, PCS is out of the money to Enron.  This trade would lower B of A's exposure to Enron.    I would like to give an answer to PCS today.  Could you please review and let me know how we proceed o n this assignment.


Thanks,
Craig

Craig,
Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two
companies.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.
