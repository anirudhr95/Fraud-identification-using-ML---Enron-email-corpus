"Re: POCCC Final Cash Call - MUY IMPORTANTE","Marc,
We have not met but I purchased John Clinch's unit about two months ago.  I
wanted to contact you to get your input as to my situation.  Currently, I
have three issues with my unit.

1. The granite has not been installed.  The back splash in the kitchen and
bathroom is not in.
2. The mini blinds are not in.
3. Most of my punch list has been completed but a few items are
outstanding.  These are of less importance that the first two items and I
realize that I got into the unit late so the crew could be behind.

I have already paid for the granite and its installation.  Can you give me
an update as to where we stand on getting this completed as it is the
largest outstanding item.

John asked for payment on the last cash call but I have a problem in that if
these items are not going to be completed, it will cost me approximately
$2500 - $3000 to replace the items, which I have already paid for.  I would
like to get everything settled and move forward.  Can you give me some
information about the above and your recommendation.

Thanks
Tim

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

The major U.S. stock index futures defied many so-called ""market
experts"" this fall and exhibited solid rebounds from the
September lows. Meantime, traders looking for action have
certainly found it in the U.S. Treasury bond futures the past
several weeks. Indeed, in November, nearby T-bond futures prices
hit a new all-time high, only to come crashing back down. What's
next for these major markets in the coming days and weeks? Let's
get the opinions of these two seasoned and respected market
analysts:

FUTURESOURCE.COM: David, let's start out with the U.S. stock
index futures. Give us the lowdown.

HIGHTOWER: One has to be impressed with the stock market action,
as prices gained while a number of commodity markets simply
discounted the chain of better than expected U.S. economic
reports. Even with the Congress doing everything they can to
create ongoing recession conditions and the leadership of Al-
Qaeda apparently escaping, the stock market maintained a
positive tilt. However, we are concerned that the gains were
simply holiday-related and that the reality of slowing will
manifest itself in a consolidation of the S&P 500. We think the
S&P will be restrained in a range bound by 1115 and 1176 until
the corporate news or the layoff news begins to show consistent

signs of improvement. The fact that the initial claims figures
have declined moderately could be a sign that the concern over
the recovery timing is overdone. However, it would seem to be a
tall order to get the US economy in position to recover prior to
the second quarter, which we think is needed in order to
surprise the market into a rally beyond 1176. If for some reason
the recovery is thrown back beyond the second quarter, that
could mean a temporary failure below the bottom of the expected
trading range. The fact that Congress failed to rise to the
occasion is a major failure, and with recent forecasts by the
IMF warning of global recession or worse in 2002, one must
continue to be skeptical toward the existing bull case. The
projected consolidation range in the Dow comes in at 9691 and
1016. Will Japan avoid financial collapse, thereby spoiling the
US recovery leadership?

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Jim, give us your views on the U.S. stock
indexes.

WYCKOFF: Price action in the U.S. stock indexes the past couple
weeks suggests they are ""rolling over"" from recent gentle
uptrends into more sideways and choppy trading ranges. I do not
look for dramatic rallies or dramatic sell-offs in the U.S.
stock indexes in the near- to intermediate term. I heard on a TV
business channel this week that traders can expect a ""Santa
Claus rally,"" or the ""January effect"" to support the U.S. stock
market in the coming weeks. One analyst said this is one of the
easiest plays in stock trading. While there is irrefutable
evidence that there is in fact a Santa Claus rally or January
effect in stocks nearly every year, I do not believe that
catching and participating in these rallies is easy. Again, it
boils down to that all-important timing factor in trading
markets.  I've been in this business long enough to have seen
Santa Claus rallies that began in October and were finished
before Christmas even arrived. In fact, that may be the case
this year. I am not ruling out a January rally in the stock
market, but technical analysis does suggest Santa Claus made an
early visit to stock traders again this year with a moderate
rally that began in late September and just recently stalled
out. Stock index bulls will regain the initiative if they can
push their respective prices above the December highs. If that
does occur, then the fabled ""January effect"" could unfold right
on time this year.

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Okay, fellas, what about the T-bond futures
market?

HIGHTOWER: The rally in the U.S. T-bond market over the last
week might be explained as a rally in a bear market. It is also
possible that yields were high enough for some long-term players
to decide to pull down some supply and lock the high rates of
return. With the continued anxiety over the Japanese economy, it
is also possible that some of the recent buying was flight-to-
quality buying by investors concerned about a debacle there. The
U.S. economic numbers released last week continued to foster the
recovery mentality and that should eventually turn the bonds
back down. In the past two corrections against the downtrend,
bonds managed 3 to 4 points on the upside while the current
correction just barely managed 3 points on the bounce.
Therefore, one should not assume that the downtrend has been
altered unless of course upcoming economic numbers repeatedly
dash the theme of recovery. The bonds might end up being
buffeted by the events in Japan, as a wholesale failure in the
Japanese economy that resulted in repatriation could cause heavy
selling of US Treasuries. Keep in mind that Japanese entities
are massive holders of long term US Treasury debt. It is
possible that the December unemployment report released in early
January will not show as dismal of a condition as was seen in
the November figures. However, we would not be surprised if the
bonds launch another recovery bounce into that time frame, as
that has been the pattern over the last three months. The ""V""
bottom recovery is not as likely, but recovery in the 2nd
quarter of 2002 is an accepted reality in bond prices.
Therefore, any serious charge against recovery could spark a
larger than expected bond bounce.

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Jim, give us your outlook for the bond market.

WYCKOFF: A couple weeks ago the T-bond market shed more than
five full points in three days! This week, the market tacked on
about three points in three days. Now that's some market
volatility! Indeed, this week, we did see a good short-covering
bounce in bonds. However, this week's rebound is still just a
good-sized technical correction in a strong bear market. A bear
flag recently developed and played out on the daily bar chart,

basis March T-Bonds. The daily chart for the March contract
shows a steep seven-week downtrend line still in place. Also, on
a longer-term chart basis, a major double-top reversal pattern
on the monthly continuation chart for nearby T-Bond futures has
formed. March T-bond futures need to push above 104 even to give
the bulls a solid boost. The good news for the bulls is that the
monthly chart does reveal a strong support layer that did check
the recent price declines. Should prices jab down below that
support zone, however, the odds greatly increase that the bears
will do some feasting in the year 2002, and the bulls will be on
the run. My bias is that decent rallies in the bond market, like
we saw this week, will be good selling opportunities and that
the bear market will roll on--until technical considerations
signal the bulls have picked themselves up off the canvas.

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Thanks for your detailed analysis, Dave and
Jim. Next week, we'll be taking your pulse on two more important
futures markets. Stay tuned!

Subject:	Reliant Entex-Tennessee Pipeline

Received a phone call on Thursday, December 13th approx. 9:15am from Royal Edmondson, Gas Control Manager for Reliant Entex.  He was trying to locate Victoria Versen and was eventually  transferred to me.  He wanted to make sure Enron was delivering gas to the Entex's city gates.  He asked if  Enron was currently nominating gas to Entex city gates? What about storage?   I told him currently we were not nominating all the gas however; the city gates were kept whole with the no notice storage K#2210.  He was told by Tennessee the storage was not being nominated & there was a good possibility that the city gates were not receiving their gas.  I reassured him the city gates were receiving their gas.  ENA does not nominate storage, it  was automatically done at the pipeline level due to the 2 day allocation lag.    As per his previous conversation with Vicki Versen, he has an estimate what the storage levels were &  wanted to make sure there was enough gas in the storage to cover December.  I told him he would need to speak with Vicki on that matter.  I asked him if there was a problem  that needed to be resolved & his response: Reliant is going to wait it through to see the outcome with Enron, but wanted to make sure the gas was being delivered.  

After the conversation, I run the storage report for December & the gas is automatically being withdrawn.  I called Royal back  and confirmed gas was being withdrawn from storage. He asked for a copy of the storage report.  I did not discuss volume or what Enron's intention were at this time. I have not  fax him a copy of the storage report as per his request.   

I did not want to alienate Royal, but at same time I did not want to provide too much information without knowing his full intentions.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above ""junk"".

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1,"" and said it may cut Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper,"" Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
""I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow,"" said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" he said. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
""We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader),"" said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
""Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem,"" said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow ""purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market,"" according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
""I think if is too early to tell,"" Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. ""As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron."" 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. ""At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions."" 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
""Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine,"" he said. ""This is a big case, by any means.""

STILL LOWER . . .

 Natural gas futures ground lower in uninspired trading Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices opened sharply lower as traders digested the latest NWS weather report showing moderate temperatures over most of the US. A lack of trade participation gave locals and short term traders some flexibility to push prices off session lows. A lower open is expected tomorrow. . .

 At the end of the day the December futures dropped $.117 to $2.696 per MMBtu, and the January lost $.056 to $2.935 per MMBtu. . .

 ""We came in lower on the weak NWS 6 to 10 day forecast which shows everywhere but the Great Plains above normal,"" noted Jim Duffy, trader with GasLink, New York. . . .

 ""The locals realized that volume was thin so they pushed prices higher
and managed to trigger a small number of stop loss orders. They weren't
fund stops or anything like that."" . .

 ""What was surprising was that there were not trade and commercial offers
up top willing to offer the market lower,"" he said. . .

 ""It's my read that the funds and managed accounts are still short as well
as the trade. It's hard to figure out who is long this market."" . .

 ""We got more phone calls today asking who was buying than anything else,""
he said. . .

 Other traders see prices working lower as well. . .

 ""I don't believe we've seen the bottom to this market,"" says Harvey Budkofsky, broker analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. . .

 ""There may be some more short covering, for marketers are trying to hold
the market up the best they can. Technical resistance is the $2.87 area for
the December and $3.02 to $3.03 for the January,"" he said. . .

 ""I believe for a physical market long who hasn't hedged that those would be
good levels to sell up against,"" he suggested.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

________________________________________________________________

The past couple weeks have witnessed higher volatility in the
currency markets, in the wake of a political and economic
meltdown in Argentina, and as two nuclear-armed nations (India
and Pakistan) step up their war rhetoric. Let's get the opinions
of two seasoned and respected market analysts: David Hightower,
editor of the Hightower Report (http://www.futures-research.com)
and Jim Wyckoff, proprietor of ""Jim Wyckoff on the Markets.""

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Dave, give us a basic fundamental
perspective on the U.S. dollar and its major counterparts.

HIGHTOWER: The U.S. dollar appears to have an entrenched bullish
sentiment over the Euro and we would expect interest in the
dollar to increase into the kick-off of the physical Euro
currency implementation.

However, it would seem that the dollar was quickly shut off from
further buying this past week when it reached above 118. This is

****************************************************************

the second time that the dollar has been quickly repelled from
that level.

We have been suggesting for weeks that the US dollar is holding
an extreme premium versus most of the world's currencies.
Therefore, a leveling out of economic conditions would seem to
pressure the dollar.

We also think that the U.S. dollar has seen an unsustainable
windfall off of Japanese yen weakness. Therefore, it is possible
that the dollar will see a blow-off top in the coming week and
that a major top could be formed.

Historically, it would seem that several major turns in the
currency markets have come in close proximity to the beginning
of a new year. In the event that the dollar does turn down, we
have to think that the Canadian and the Swiss will see the most
significant recovery capacity.

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Jim, give us more of a technical view on the
U.S. dollar index and the major IMM currency futures.

WYCKOFF: The past two weeks have seen the March U.S. dollar
index spring sharply higher, after prices had been trending
lower during late November and the first have of December. Last
week, the March dollar index hit a high of 118.85, and has since
seen some healthy consolidation of the recent strong gains.

The dollar index bulls indeed have the near term edge, and the
longer-term charts are also friendlier to the bulls. If the
bulls can push the March dollar index above the 119.00 level,

****************************************************************

that will give them the momentum to challenge the July high of
121.29. A drop below 114.75 means the market will likely
languish in more of a choppy and sideways trading range in the
near term.

Bulls should be warned that if prices do sell off from here, a
big head-and-shoulders top reversal pattern could develop on the
weekly continuation chart for nearby dollar index futures. But
right now, the bulls are enjoying the technical advantage.

As for the Euro currency, the weekly continuation chart for
nearby Euro futures should give the bulls some encouragement, as
well as throw a scare into U.S. dollar index bulls. A longer-
term downtrend line drawn off the 1998 high was penetrated on
the upside and negated just about a year ago. Since that time,
prices have been trading sideways in a choppy pattern. This
choppy trading has also formed a coiling pattern--whereby the
sideways trading range has become more compacted the past
several weeks. This is suggestive of a bigger ""breakout-type""
price move in the not-too-distant future.

Given the recent lowly price levels in the Euro, odds do favor
that potential breakout being to the upside. There is also
potential for a big double-bottom reversal pattern on the weekly
chart. Indeed, there are clues on this chart that suggest the
Euro currency bulls will enjoy more success in the coming year
than they did in the past year.

From a shorter-term perspective, if March Euro currency futures
prices drop down below the November low of .8708, then the door
is opened to much more downside. If that low can hold and prices
work higher, then a big double-bottom reversal could be in the
works.

Finally, the Japanese yen has been in a nosedive for nearly two
months. This steep decline appears to be a ""washout"" or
exhaustion-type selling phase that many times precedes a major
change in trend. But bottom-pickers should beware. Right now,
would-be long-side traders do not want to stand in front of a
steaming locomotive. They should first let the market show them
some solid signals of strength before attempting to board the
bullish train.

FUTURESOURCE.COM: Thanks for the comments, Dave and Jim. We'll
look forward to more of your insight in the coming weeks.

IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYN
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
""Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,"" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14
By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of Dow Jones Newswires 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to ""BBB-"" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. 
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. 
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. 
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. 
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. 
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. 
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. 
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. 
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. 
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. 
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;

Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus ""give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest,"" Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron ""locked down"" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal

11/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant's acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal's breaking clause, dealers said. 
At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. 
Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. 
""People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage,"" said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. 
The deal with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. 
Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. 
""At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued,"" said Jefferies' Hogan.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.
By Janet McGurty

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. 
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.
""The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms,"" said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. 
""Escape clauses"" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. 
""Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness,"" he said. 
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
""Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place,"" Heim said. ""Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?"" 
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. 
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. 
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. 
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. 
""Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. 
""How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?"" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. 
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. 
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. 
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. 
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. 
""Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans,"" he said. 
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was ""completely indefensible,"" he said. 
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. 
Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..

USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.

11/26/2001

By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed
Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks 
following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad 
revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. 
In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between 
the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 
0.01 percentage point. 
""I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially 
with Treasury interest rates going up,"" said one trader. ""Absolute 
corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive."" 
Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed 
Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for 
risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds 
are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where 
investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic 
downturn won't be deep or long. 
""The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated 
economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for 
risk,"" wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a 
report dated Monday. ""While the severity and swiftness of the bond 
market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic 
view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend 
overweight positions."" 
This week's forward calendar remains quiet. 
In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their 
yields fell to 4.971 percent. 
ENRON 
Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron 
Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge 
with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its 
investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 
billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured 
and coming due within 13 months. 
Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by 
mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk 
status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers 
believe, is Enron's banks. 
""The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain 
as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out 
fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve 
their risk-profile under multiple scenarios,"" said CreditSights. 
""The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new 
secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity 
investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 
billion in bank loans,"" wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for 
GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. ""If Dynegy 
backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank 
renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as 
the patsies."" 
Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 
percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on 
the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first 
reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. 
Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest 
level since early 1989. 
DATA 
Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 
percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 
percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond 
spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. 
For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while 
investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and 
Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the 
respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting ""the perfect storm"" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. 
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron."" 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he said. ""I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility."" 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,"" he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,"" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
""One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,"" O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's AV Birla group denies bid for Enron unit.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6) 
BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company.
""There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested,"" a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. 
Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. 
The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company. 
An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. 
""We have not received any official communication from them,"" the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. 
The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. 
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL 
Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. 
Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. 
Tata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake. 
The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. 
Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd 
Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems 
But the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. 
Two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)
2001-11-26 16:45 (New York)

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price
declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on
concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital,
threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.

     ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The
question is the survivability of Enron.''

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met
today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds
convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate
until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled
its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1
p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's
6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the
dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26
percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.

     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for
Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.
Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after
the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost it $1.01 billion.

     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a
bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the
$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in
Washington.

     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited
partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an
investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this
month restated its earnings for the past four years.

                        Talks on $1 Billion

     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy
share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21
percent more than Enron's share price that day.

     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more
than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the
difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price
indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.

     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to
close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading
Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to
$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies
are based in Houston.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,
or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a
week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for
comment.

     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though
it maintained an investment grade.

                          `More Problems'

     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head
of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is
increased concern in the market that there may be more problems
that are yet to be disclosed.''

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.

     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first
time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has
less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the
company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be
cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in
debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be
hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila
Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron
because of credit concerns.

     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it
likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone
company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the
credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up
further.''

     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a
quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.

     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake
as part of a transaction to be completed today.



Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have
fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the
energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.
will erode its credit rating.

     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at
$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according
to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9
percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to
compensate for the increased risks of the securities.

     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors
Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at
Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it
may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with
about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial
partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.

     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a
detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,
senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at
$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,
according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from
5.4 percent.

     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at
S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies
are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's
buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.

     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron
is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5
billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.

     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years
so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''
Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't
understand they'll walk away.''

     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which
come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks
ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase
would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30
to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92
percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to
$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.



ENRON SHARES SLIDES TO ALL-TIME LOW

By CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,
crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast
additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival
Dynegy.

Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before
closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an
agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value
in the past month.

Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand
at $39.25.

The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy
and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in
which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding
Enron share.

However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of
its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500
million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.

""We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading
business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with
counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals,"" A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a
research note Friday.

Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under
the current terms, the analysts said.



Chance of Dynegy backing out

_______________________________________________________________________

On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's
latest stock drop to ""growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)
deal is not so likely.""

He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is ""not very favorable"" but
in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay ""afloat"" while
working on closing the deal.


Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to
mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was
bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>

The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion
in cash on its hands, Heim said, but ""the event moves Enron's merger one
step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the
merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or
restructure, the merger deal.""

Heim has a ""sell"" rating on the stock.

FUTURES SURGE HIGHER . . .

 Natural gas futures scored triple digit gains in typically active expiration day trading Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices opened higher and continued to advance closing near the highs of the session. Longer term traders see prices reaching a threshold of resistance approximately 16 cents higher. . .

 At the end of the day, the November contract rose $.161 to $3.202 per MMBtu, and the December tacked on $.156 to $3.339 per MMBtu. . .

 ""The marginal cost for natural gas currently in storage for this season
is about $3.50 per MMBtu,"" says Tom Saal, Vice President Pioneer Futures,
Miami. . .
 ""That should act as a ceiling for any further advances in natural gas
prices,"" he said. . .
 In the short term prices are rising to marginal cost because the threat of
increasing demand in part due to winter weather forecasts is rising daily. . .
 As prices approach that level, $3.50 should act as resistance, for should prices rise above marginal cost, buyers would have an incentive to utilize the lower priced gas at the expense of higher priced market gas.

"Don't Mess with Texas.","One Texas Soldier
A large group of Taliban soldiers  are moving down a road when they hear a
voice call from behind a sand  dune.
""One Texas  soldier is better than ten Taliban"".
The Taliban commander quickly orders  10 of his best men over the dune
whereupon a gun-battle breaks out and continues  for a few minutes, then
silence.
The voice once again calls out ""One  Texan is better than one hundred
Taliban"".  Furious, the Taliban  commander sends his next best 100 troops
over the dune and instantly a huge gun  fight commences. After 10 minutes of
battle, again silence.
The Texan voice calls out again ""One  Texan is better than one thousand
Taliban"".
The enraged Taliban commander  musters 1000 fighters and sends them to the
other side of the dune. Rifle fire,  machine guns, grenades, rockets and
cannon fire ring out as a terrible battle is  fought....  Then silence.
Eventually one badly wounded Taliban  fighter crawls back over the dune and
with his dying words tells his  commander,  ""Don't send any more men......
its a trap.  There's two of  them"".

Subject: RE: practice tonight


I am writing this email to express some concern that I have that has
been gnawing at me over the past week.

It is a concern over a feeling that each of us is having.  It's a
feeling of having too much to do.  Too much practice, too much homework,
too much football, too much baseball, too much of everything!

I caught myself recently telling someone about our kids schedules in an
exacerbated way and after completing my sentence it hit me.  What I
realized was that I was complaining about something that was probably
one of the most wonderful ""problems"" that a parent or child could have.


To have children that have the ability to play sports, the opportunity
to excel in school and have parents that care enough about them to
support all that they do is a true blessing, not a problem.  I am sure
that there are hundreds of thousands of kids in this city alone that
would pay money to trade places with each of us.

I have found a poem that I wanted to share with each of you that I think
says a lot.  To me it says that we should be setting an example for our
kids.  Encouraging their hard work at school and in sports, not
discouraging it through negative comments about having too much to do.
If we all as parents start to ""talk-up"" school, practice, football,
baseball, etc. about how fun it is and how great it is to be with such a
great group of kids, the results will be amazing!

Little Eyes Upon You

There are little eyes upon you
and they're watching night and day.
There are little ears that quickly
take in every word you say.
There are little hands all eager
to do anything you do;
And a little boy who's dreaming
of the day he'll be like you.

You're the little fellow's idol,
you're the wisest of the wise.
In his little mind about you
no suspicions ever rise.
He believes in you devoutly,
holds all that you say and do;
He will say and do, in your way,
when he's grown up just like you.

There's a wide eyed little fellow
who believes you're always right;
And his eyes are always opened,
an he watches day and night.
Your setting an example
every day in all you do,
For the little boy who's waiting
to grow up to be like you.

Until further notice, please set (and/or have your traders set) all of the curves to market representative numbers each day.  I hope that you have been doing so all along, but I heard today that this may not be happening on all desks.  Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please ask.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear brad,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   Just a reminder - On Friday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante is live in Cairo, Egypt covering the OPEC meeting.  Join us tomorrow as Kim brings us the latest on possible oil production cuts beginning in January.      We'll also have more reaction from here in Washington to the OPEC meeting.  American Petroleum Institute Chief Economist John Felmy, Ph.D., will share his thoughts on the cartel's moves and what they might mean for the U.S.  Also during the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast, The Petroleum Finance Company Senior Market Analyst George Beranek will give us his assessment of the market if OPEC follows through with a production cut.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has had a very busy year - from the California crisis to the crisis at Enron, the Commission has had a full docket.  On Friday during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast, we'll hear what former FERC Chairman James Hoecker thinks about the past year at the FERC and what issues may surface during the New Year.   As the year draws to a close, the Houston bureau will take a look back at one of the biggest energy stories - the collapse of the energy giant, Enron.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says on Friday, the Houston bureau will review the timetable of Enron's demise, the effects of its bankruptcy filing, layoffs and the company's downgraded credit rating.    As Texas deregulation nears, competition in the market is heating up among retail energy providers.  The Houston bureau says the Texas Public Utility Commission set the price to beat for areas in the state, and competing retail energy providers are beating those prices.  We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says on Friday, California Senator Debra Bowen talks about what to expect from the legislature in the first few weeks of 2002.  Kym says possible topics of discussion include the issuance of the state's $12.5 billion in energy bonds, the California Power Authority and plans to get Southern California Edison and PG?out of debt.   Also on Friday from the West Coast bureau, California Energy Commissioner Michael Moore talks about the gas supplies in California.  Join us for these reports and more from Sacramento tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Thursday, Dec. 27, 2001    Crude: $20.90/bbl -$0.37   Unleaded: $0.5927/gallon -$0.0086   Heating Oil: $0.5815/gallon -$0.0131   Gas: $2.555/mmBtu -$0.356   Broadcasting Note: On New Year's Eve, we're broadcasting through 1:00 p.m. ET.  We're dark on New Year's Day.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Subject:	Gas Merchantability Reminder

December 19, 2001

Notice to: All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, 
Interconnecting Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental 
Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) System

 Subject: Gas Merchantability Reminder

Transco has been receiving gas with a slightly higher heating 
content (btu/cf) in its mainline over the past week and feels 
this is the result of processing plants scaling back their 
operations due to poor economics. Transco reminds Producers and 
Shippers on its system to ensure that processing arrangements 
are in place and that the gas received by Transco meets its 
merchantability requirements. 

These gas merchantability specifications are outlined in 
Transco's gas merchantability notice, most recently re-posted 
July 27, 2001. 

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact 
the following at Transco: Ron Doyle, 713-215-2921 or Terry 
Fitch, 713-215- 3361.

I had no idea that you were having any problems! Ever since you initially had seizures I have prayed for your health and, having heard nothing different, thought that you were doing fine.
 
I pray that they will be albe to find out what is causing your problem, that it might be corrected.
 
Suffering is never fun (and you could tell me far about it than I can tell you). However, Psalm 3:3 couldn't be clearer -""You, O Lord, are a shield for me, my glory, and the One who lifts up my head.""
 
While I pray that your problem is both diagnosable and correctable, we must remember that our strength (and our hope) lies not in proper diagnosis but in Him who transcends both the miseries and the pleasures of this world. Thus wrote Paul, ""He gave Himself for us, that whether we wake or sleep we might live unto Him."" (2 Thess. 5:10)
 
I am praying for you too Brad; praying for your strength.
 
We look forward to seeing you both.

I got a better picture of the delay issue when I talked to Keith this morning.  Apparently, his group has lost their server liscence.  As a  consequence they cannot access their materials.  Keith is doing everything he can that does not require the server, and when they regain access, we will get the map out asap.  In the mean time, I am looking into major interconnects as well as storage facilities.  As of now, I don't have a precise timeline on when the server issue will be resolved.  When it occurs, I'll let you know.

(Wraps FINANCIAL-CREDITQUALITY-MOODYS and FINANCIAL-DEFAULTS-S&P) 
By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better, and about $100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the United States heads into recession, according to reports issued on Monday by two top credit rating agencies. 
Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 U.S. companies with $543 billion of debt in the third quarter, dwarfing the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit. 
""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. 
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on about $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a record $42.3 billion in 2000. 
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated ""BB-plus"" or lower by S&P and ""Ba1"" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will reach 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate. 
""The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession,"" said S&P Chief Economist David Wyss in a statement. ""Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high."" 
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in September alone on the attacks. 
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. 
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance and travel. 
""Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink,"" said David Keisman, managing director at S&P Risk Solutions. 
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines. 
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock, at a time S&P said the company's ""growth prospects for the future are less optimistic."" 
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it again. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business. 
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. 
Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.

USA: U.S. firms say deals with Enron at normal levels.
By Andrew Kelly

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Major U.S. wholesale natural gas and electricity traders said on Monday their deals with troubled Enron Corp. are still running at normal levels. 
But some are keeping a wary eye on the company's finances and credit status after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies.
""We certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watching that on a daily basis,"" Chief Executive Marce Fuller of Atlanta energy marketer Mirant Corp. told Reuters. 
""At this point, I would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual with Enron, but we'll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward,"" said Fuller. 
Officials at companies such as Houston natural gas firm El Paso Corp. and Columbus, Ohio, utility holding company American Electric Power Co. Inc. expressed similar sentiments, saying nothing had changed in their dealings with the Houston-based energy company, at least for the time being. 
""We continue to trade with them,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Pierce of Charlotte-based utility Duke Energy Corp.. ""They've always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them,"" she added. 
Enron's shares fell to yet another new low on Monday as the company said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency Moody's Investor Service downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk-bond status. 
Since Oct. 12 Enron's stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss in over four years, wrote down shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors' jitters about a series of complex off-balance-sheet financial deals. 
CONFIDENCE CRUMBLES 
Analysts say that if confidence in Enron continued to crumble, it could restrict the company's access to credit and thus create problems for its core energy trading operations. 
European energy industry sources told Reuters earlier on Monday that there was already evidence of European companies shying away from trading with Enron because of credit worries. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron in Europe as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" said the head of risk management at one U.K. utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
Traders in the U.S. wholesale energy markets said on Monday that they were continuing to deal with Enron and still regard the company as a reliable trading partner. 
""I don't have any problems dealing with Enron, especially since I'm doing day-ahead trades. But I have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal with them,"" one natural gas trader in the U.S. Southeast told Reuters. 
A trader who specializes in longer-term deals in the forwards market for electricity said publicity about Enron's woes had not yet led to any loss of market liquidity. 
""Obviously there's a concern, but the financial situation is not a factor now,"" the trader said. 
Despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speaking, Enron's major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the situation closely. 
""Any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deteriorating, then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried,"" said Mirant's Fuller.

Enron Bonds Stabilize But Market Players Are Concerned
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/29/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Uncertainty about Enron Corp. (ENE) continues to dog investors concerned about the future of the Houston-based energy services company. 
""It's such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarification of the company's circumstances,"" said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. Until this occurs, the outlook for the company's bonds is choppy, he added.
Enron drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery markets, buying back its outstanding commercial paper. And, it's currently negotiating with its bank group for an additional $1 billion to $2 billion in new credit, according to a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal. 
Enron's troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $618 million third-quarter loss and the disclosure of a $1.2 billion erosion of investor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""The company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead of the game on disclosure,"" said Mitch Stapley, portfolio manager and chief fixed income officer, Fifth Third Investment Advisors, Grand Rapids, Mich. It becomes harder to regain investors' trust, he said. 
Moody's Investors Service lowered the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating Monday to Baa2 from Baa1. The debt is rated triple-B-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp., with a negative outlook. Fitch also maintains a triple-B-plus rating and it placed the debt on Rating Watch Negative late last week. 
Both Fitch and Moody's cited negative investor reaction to recent company developments. And Moody's added that its ""analysis of the developing situation will focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties."" 
One money manager said he was concerned ""about the fallout and its impact on the company's ability to trade"" energy. 
The company's bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty. The bonds with a 6.40% coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar price of 80 on Friday. Many investors believe that the 80 dollar price point is a demarcation separating high-yield debt from distressed debt levels. 
The company's bonds improved a little on Monday, to about an 83 dollar price. 
""I'm seeing offerings but no bids,"" said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivkin & Co., Princeton, N.J. There is a reluctance on the part of potential buyers because of the threat of future downgrades, he said. 
The cool reception that Enron's bonds are receiving is ""another example of an investment grade company not having sponsorship when it has problems,"" said Northern Trust's Bergson. 
The company did not respond to a telephone request for comment.

Enron's stock continues slide on credit woes

10/29/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s stock slid to new lows on Monday, pushed down in part by Moody's Investors Service announcing a possible downgrade of the company's credit rating pending a review. 
The downgrade came as Enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit lines as the largest U.S. natural gas and power marketing company struggles to bounce back from disappointing third quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company's former chief financial officer.
In trading Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down nearly 9 percent, or dlrs 1.38 a share, at dlrs 14.02 - their lowest level in nearly seven years. A year ago, Enron stock sold at nearly dlrs 85 a share. 
Enron's efforts to acquire more credit came after the Houston-based company last week decided to cash in about dlrs 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence. 
""We are in discussions about new credit lines,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Monday. ""We're taking action to restore investor and market confidence."" 
Denne would not disclose how much credit the company was seeking. But The Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified sources who said the amount is between dlrs 1 billion and dlrs 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed. 
Denne said of the dlrs 3 billion in credit Enron cashed in last week, dlrs 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt. Currently, there are no plans for the other dlrs 1 billion, she said. 
Moody's on Monday placed all of Enron's long term debt obligations on review for downgrade, citing ""substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses."" 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of dlrs 1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. 
Enron's stock was hammered over the next week as it became apparent some of those losses were tied to partnerships managed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Concerns about a potential conflict of interest touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Enron ousted Fastow last week. 
Moody's said in a press release the ""magnitude of the announced charges will reduce Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 percent while slashing earnings.""

UK: UK power mkt focuses on prompt after low peak deal.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Interest in Britain's electricity markets focused on the prompt after the sale of peak power at an unexpected low price tugged other prompt contracts lower. 
Traders said the market was surprised by the sale of day ahead peak power for EFA blocks three and four, from 0700 to 1500, at 13.50 pounds per megawatt hour which they said was below coal-or gas-fired power stations' operating cost.
""It was an interesting day. It was hard to believe someone could sell at those prices - it's below marginal costs,"" said one trader. 
Day ahead baseload opened relatively firm at 19.50/20.50 pounds but slipped during the day to around 18 pounds and was traded at about 17.56 pounds after the low peak trades. 
Traders said the forward curve was quite with contracts ending slightly lower. 
Attention focused on troubled U.S. energy trader Enron with European companies shying away from dealing with the utility because of credit concerns. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements. 
Enron is one of the largest traders in the UK market but traders said it was too early see any impact on liquidity. 
""Friday and Monday tend to be quieter anyway - it's hard to tell if there's any effect from Enron,"" said one trader. 
Enron in London declined to comment on the situation.

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron says in talks with banks for new credit line.

(Changes paragraph 1, adds background details and byline, updates stock price) 
By David Howard Sinkman
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its shares in a new free-fall to near seven-year lows, said on Monday it is seeking additional credit to bolster investor confidence after tapping about $3 billion in credit last week. 
Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with or when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston, referring to company efforts to secure new credit. 
Company shares again tumbled on Monday, shedding $1.57, or 10.13 percent, to $13.93 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Once a Wall Street darling, the stock has tumbled more than half in price since Enron released earnings two weeks ago, losing about $15.1 billion in market capitalization as investors fretted about the transparency of off-balance sheet transactions. 
Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut it again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. Rating agency Standard & Poor's on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable."" 
Enron's credit-worthiness has a direct affect on the price it pays to take out loans, and the perception among its trading partners on the company's ability to make good on trades. 
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments. It said this triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper."" 
Industry sources on Monday said several large energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status. 
SIGN OF WEAKNESS 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the size of the credit line Enron is negotiating is between $1 billion to $2 billion. Enron said it drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
However, many industry observes see the request by Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, for an additional credit as a sign of weakness. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson, who specializes in high grade corporate bonds. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation.""

USA: TRADE IDEA-Junk rating not likely for Enron.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A collapse of market 
confidence could hurt the credit quality of energy trading
giant Enron Corp., but its bonds are not likely to end 
up in junk territory, fixed-income research service GimmeCredit 
said on Monday. 
Moreover, Enron's bonds could be undervalued if the 
company's off-balance-sheet obligations amount to no more 
than $3 billion, as reported, GimmeCredit said. 
""Worst case, Enron doesn't look like a junk credit,"" 
GimmeCredit analyst Carol Levenson said. ""But perception is 
all, and clearly both the stock and bond markets view Enron 
as being in dire straits."" 
Enron's bonds fell sharply on Friday after the energy 
giant drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and 
said it was in talks with its banks to obtain a new 
multibillion-dollar credit line. 
The company's stock has lost more than half of its 
value in the last two weeks as investors questioned 
off-balance-sheet transactions between the company and two 
limited partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer 
Andrew Fastow. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
is looking into those transactions for possible conflicts 
of interest. 
""We admit management's financial disclosure remains 
woefully inadequate,"" GimmeCredit said. ""However, botched 
investor communication does not necessarily equate to 
illegal or fraudulent behavior."" 
Still, Enron's move last week to draw down all of its 
backup bank lines was ""an act of desperation,"" GimmeCredit 
said. The move eventually may lead to renegotiated bank 
agreements, which could be more expensive and restrictive 
and could also subordinate the position of bondholders, it 
said. 
""On the plus side is our belief that management will do 
everything in their power to preserve the company's 
investment-grade ratings,"" the firm said. 
Another positive is a precedent the rating agencies set 
with Kmart Corp. in the mid-1990s, when they tried to avoid 
being the cause of a company's financial downfall, GimmeCredit 
said. 
Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut Enron's senior 
unsecured rating to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1"" and kept it on 
review for further downgrade. Moody's said its actions were 
prompted by deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility 
since the company announced significant write-downs and 
equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership 
investments. 
Last Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on 
Enron to negative while affirming its ""BBB-plus"" long-term 
rating.

USA: Enron shares drop to near seven-year lows.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. shares fell to their lowest level in almost seven years in early trade on Monday following news that North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader was considering tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron shares were down $1.55, or 10 percent, to $13.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have not been under $14 since December 1994.
Earlier, the credit-rating agency Moody's Investor Service placed all long term-debt obligations of Enron under review for downgrade following the company's announcement of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. 
Moody's said the actions affect Enron's broadband operations, its merchant portfolio, and the Azurix water company holdings. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

Enron long-term ratings all placed on review for downgrade - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it placed all the long-term debt obligations of Enron on review for downgrade following the company's announcement of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. 
The magnitude of the announced charges will reduce Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 pct while slashing earnings, Moody's said in a statement.
The company's previously announced sale of Portland General, however, will result in cash proceeds approximating 1.8 bln usd which management is earmarking for debt reduction. In addition, the sale will remove approximately 1 bln usd of debt obligations from Enron's balance sheet. 
However, Moody's noted that, while this transaction will go a long way to help restore Enron's balance sheet, it requires regulatory approval and is likely to take up to a year to complete. 
Enron has a Baa1 senior unsecured rating.

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)

     (Adds bondholder quote and background on commercial paper.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares declined
a ninth day as Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit
rating, raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut off
from raising the cash it needs to fund day-to-day operations.

     Moody's lowered Enron's senior unsecured long-term debt
ratings to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1'' and also
placed the Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.

     Moody's may downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, which
would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short-term cash
needed to run its trading businesses. Ahead of a potential cut,
Enron took out bank lines to repay $2 billion in commercial paper
last week, largely removing itself from that borrowing arena.

     ``They've pretty much already written off coming to the
commercial-paper market,'' said Shannon Bass, who holds Enron
bonds in the $50 million he helps manage at Pacific Investment
Management Co. ``The real issue now is trying to get their house
in order.''

     Pimco is ``well underweight'' Enron bonds relative to bond
benchmarks the portfolios are matched to, Bass said.

                             Shut Out

     Companies such as Xerox Corp., which was shut out of the
commercial-paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were
reduced, were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access
cash. Investors in commercial paper, borrowings due in nine months
or less, also stopped buying Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies
Inc. short-term debt, forcing the firms to restructure borrowing,
sell assets, and find alternative financing sources that typically
cost more.

     Enron shares plunged $1.59, or 10 percent, to $13.81,
continuing a slide that dates back to Oct. 17, when Enron reported
$1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of
energy trading.

     The stock traded near $90 in September 2000 and touched a
seven-year low of $13.55 today. Enron has lost more than $50
billion in market value this year. On Dec. 31, the company had a
market capitalization of $62.7 billion. Today, the market value
was $10.5 billion.

                           Deterioration

     While Enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week, its
bonds are down about 20 percent. A company's stock typically falls
faster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on
assets after bank loans are paid.

     The company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents
to 80 cents on the $1 of face value after the Moody's downgrade.
Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before that
downgrade, traders said. The bonds were trading at 100 cents the
week before.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before this
month, which ``led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,''
according to Moody's.

     ``A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their
borrowing power,'' said Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for Wayne
Hummer Investments LLC in Chicago. ``That's not a good place for
them to be. They have somewhat aggressive expansion plans.''

     Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-
rating reduction. ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen,
who holds Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he
helps manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     There are about $15.8 billion of Enron bonds outstanding,
almost $9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006,
according to Bloomberg data.

                            Cash Needed

     Last week, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed. In August, Jeff Skilling quit as Enron chief executive,
eight months after taking the position, and Chairman Ken Lay moved
back into the position.

    Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when Fastow's partnerships
were disclosed.

    Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``When you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings.
It's likely their trading volumes will go down'' as other energy
and financial firms seek higher-rated trading partners, said Sean
Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which gives
Enron's credit a junk grade of ``BB+.''

     Enron's long-term ratings outlook was changed last week to
negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the firm's
rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
``We are still investment grade.''



Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.59, or 10 percent, to
$13.81. The stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months.



Enron May Be Royal Dutch/Shell Takeover Target, Newsletter Says
2001-10-29 13:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
the second-largest publicly traded oil company, may be interested
in buying Enron Corp., which has seen its stock price plunge in
the last two weeks, industry newsletter Power Finance & Risk
reported, citing unnamed sources.

     With Enron's market valued dropping below $11.5 billion from
a high of more than $55 billion, companies such as Royal
Dutch/Shell would be able to buy it with ``little trouble,'' the
newsletter reported.

     Royal Dutch/Shell, based in London and The Hague,
Netherlands, had approached Enron about a buyout in August, and
has sought to purchase the company for three years, the newsletter
said, citing an unnamed banker in London and an unnamed analyst in
New York.

     Shell spokesman Mary Brennan said the company wouldn't
comment on market speculation. Enron didn't immediately return
calls seeking comment on reports of possible buyout offer.



Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

     (Adds yield data in fourth paragraph; adds Moody's comments
in sixth and seventh paragraphs.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
was cut by Moody's Investors Service after the largest energy
trader wrote down the value of its assets because of losses from
private partnerships.

     Moody's also said it may downgrade Enron's commercial paper
rating, which could make it harder for the company to borrow the
short-term cash it needs to run its trading business in the
future. The company borrowed from banks to repay $2 billion in
commercial paper last week.

     ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen, who holds
Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he helps
manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as much as
4 cents to bid at 80 cents on $1 of face value after the Moody's
downgrade, traders said. The bonds tumbled from about par value a
week ago. Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before
that downgrade, traders said. Shares of Enron fell as much as
$1.85, or 12 percent, to $13.55.

     Moody's lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings
of Enron to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' The
ratings company said they may be lowered further. Moody's placed
the company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper on review for
downgrade.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before.

     Enron's recent disclosures have ``led to a substantial loss
in investor confidence,'' Moody's said in its news release.

                            Cash Needed

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses this month from
investments outside its business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
quit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed.

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when the partnerships were
disclosed.

     Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the  cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``Enron definitely depends on higher ratings,'' Dineen said.
     Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed last
week to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed
the Houston-based company's rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of
Moody's ``Baa1''.

Insiders at Electric Utilities Showing Their Faith 
By Jonathan Moreland <<mailto:jonathan@insiderinsights.com>>
Special to TheStreet.com

Name an industry where one of its best-known players went public in 1996, saw its stock rise more than 1,800% in the following five years, but now finds its shares half off their 2001 highs? Internet? Telecom equipment? 
Surprise! The stock is Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary) , and the industry is electric utilities. 
Three other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides as well, only to find themselves well off their 52-week highs: AES (AES:NYSE - news - commentary) , Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary) and NRG Energy (NRG:NYSE - news - commentary) . 
These four companies also have something else in common: Insiders at all of them are signaling that their stocks are oversold. When there is significant insider buying in so many related firms, we cannot help but think there is a positive industry trend to profit from. 
Utilities may not seem like a sexy sector, but these particular stocks have proved that they can move as well as any small-cap, high-tech play. Their volatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not regulated utilities paying fat dividends, but independent power producers (IPPs) that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs. 
In some ways, IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was to the Spanish Armada. IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography of their business movements. This has spurred a more entrepreneurial culture at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when chasing after business opportunities. 
The insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting. They all had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period, and many of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies' shares. Several were also adding significantly to their holdings. 
At AES, for example, three of the eight executives that purchased shares in late September for $13 a share or less, were also smart sellers over the past few years when AES fetched between $40 to $60. And at Mirant, the five insiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average of 53%. 
This confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me researching these companies and this industry further, and I like what I see. 
""There's been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy,"" remarks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP stocks are weak now. ""But while supply may be fine right now, you also have to look at the quality of [that] supply. There is such a tremendous opportunity to replace infrastructure."" 
Out With the Old, In With the New
The fact is, there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened backbones in the power industry, and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from replacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy in the U.S. and abroad. 
With more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present, aging facilities exacerbating price spikes, municipalities and industry would much rather choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are available. 
Although most IPPs use oil, gas, coal or a combination of these fuels to power present facilities, the vast majority of plants they're building now are a new generation of natural gas-powered turbines that are much more efficient than old gas-fired facilities. An IPP will typically build one of these new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity needs, and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business. 
But it's not really fair competition. New plants can generate up to 40% more energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs. The new natural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than their predecessors, and can therefore be located closer to where the power is needed. Can you say lower transmission costs? 
So with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two-thirds of a generator's cost, less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmission infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP's bottom line. 
As older gas-fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned, IPPs will continue to increase the amount of product (and profits) they produce. At the same time, the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increases in overall demand for natural gas, and keep the cost of this commodity from reaching stratospheric levels. 
Although, as previously mentioned, IPP stocks are well off their highs, analysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now. Most analysts following the four IPPs I've recommended rate them a buy or strong buy. 
This is not too surprising considering that bottom-line growth for NRG, AES, and Calpine next year is forecast at 24% to 25%, while analysts expect Mirant to boost earnings per share by 30% in 2002. All of these shares are trading for 12 times or less the low end of next year's EPS expectations. 
Chartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I've mentioned still look weak, and may choose to wait for a better entry point. But longer-term investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now. 
Postscript
Readers will note that we have not included Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) in our group of recommended IPPs. Although we cannot boast of foreseeing its present travails (resulting from too-clever-by-half off-balance sheet investments), we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive insider signal like its peers. 
Insiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug. 2 of this year when the stock was nearly half off its highs, and although there was one insider purchase in August, there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP stocks we've recommended. There was no buying after Sept. 11. 
If Enron's problems are unique to it, as the industry insiders we talked to believe, this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellent signal of relative attractiveness of stocks within an industry. 


A Debacle Like Enron's Can Undermine the Entire Market

Sometimes one stock can completely transfix the market in a negative way. 
Right now that one stock is Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . It transfixes us because it acknowledges a simple truth: We are just dealing with pieces of paper here, pieces of paper backed up by nothing but the honesty and culture of the people who work at the company. 
When you put it that way, you realize how fragile this game can be. We have to believe that the system of checks and balances we have -- outside accountants, lawyers and the SEC -- can put enough pressure, honest pressure, on execs to keep them from doing the wrong thing. 
When they don't we have no clue of what we are buying. 
I keep thinking back to Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which collapsed three years ago when it turns out that one of the companies that made up Cendant was a bogus company: CU International. Who knew what the company was really worth if CU was a fraud? Who knew what the multiple might be? Who knew what the company was worth? Who knew how to value it? 
When you don't know, you don't average down. You sell. You ask questions later. 
That's what is going on with Enron right now, and it is freaking out everybody as Enron, while not a keystone of this market, was a core holding of outfits like Janus, Putnam, Citigroup, State Street and Fidelity. 
Anytime you get a stock that is widely held that loses billions in market capitalization overnight, whether it be Lucent (LU:NYSE - news - commentary) or Nortel (NT:NYSE - news - commentary) or Enron, you scare portfolio managers. When the selloff is exacerbated by fears of chicanery, it gets even worse. Enron's turning into the story that threatens to be a crossover, one that is doing more than just pulling down utilities. The market is about confidence. We have to have confidence that paper assets are backed up by something, even if it is the prestige and honor of executives. When that confidence is undermined in one major stock, it gets undermined in all. 
That's where we are right now.

Moody's downgrades Enron's debt
Enron asking banks for more credit 
Lisa Sanders
CBSMarketWatch.com
10/29/01
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Shares of Enron fell further Monday after Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt a notch.
Enron, which hit a 52-week high of $84.88 on Dec. 29, was well on its way to another year low Monday. Heading for a ninth straight day of losses, Enron shed more than 9 percent, or $1.41, to $13.99. The stock was again the most active mover on the New York Stock Exchange as close to 28 million shares had changed hands.
Moody's said it cut the senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades. The action follows Enron's reported $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter and was driven by the expectation of further write-downs and the swift deterioration of the company's financial picture, said Stephen Moore, vice president at Moody's. 
""However, we do feel the move Enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move,"" said Stephen Moore, vice president at Moody's. The rating agency said it would review the Prime-2 rating on Enron's commercial paper.
Last Thursday, Enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $2 billion to pay down commercial paper.
The decision to pay off the commercial paper, he said, accomplishes two goals.
""It increases liquidity on a short-term basis, and additionally, it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now,"" Moore said. ""They are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business."" 
Karen Denne, an Enron spokesperson, confirmed Monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing. Additional credit would help boost Enron's liquidity position.
The lingering concern for Moody's is that there ""yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of Enron itself,"" Moore said. 
At the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships -- LMJ and LMJ2 - created in 1999 by former CFO Andy Fastow and since dissolved. Enron ousted Fastow last week. See related story. </news/story.asp?guid=%7BFCA73BA9%2D55D0%2D4EE8%2DB6E7%2DBD924898CA4B%7D&siteid=mktw> ""The market was unaware,"" of the existence of the partnerships, Moore said.
""Quite frankly, we don't think there is anything else,"" he said. ""But Enron is huge, and if this could happen...there is a lingering concern that something else might happen. We cannot confirm or deny that this is true. We will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these.""
Moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week.
""Should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events, that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business, the Enron engine,"" he said. 
Moody's action Monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts -- Marlin Water Trust and Osprey, which have combined debt of $3.2 billion. Marlin is now rated Baa2, while Osprey carries a new rating of Baa3, both down a notch.
The potential issue for the trusts may be ""how much equity Enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn't enough to pay off the debt."" Enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of assets to meet its obligation.

Enron Goes Begging 
Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com </news>, 10.29.01, 11:40 AM ET 

NEW YORK - Enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for additional credit, as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six-year low and several large energy groups put their dealings with Enron on hold. Last Thursday, the energy trader drew down about $3 billion from a credit line, causing its bonds to fall sharply on Friday. 

Enron (nyse: ENE ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business partners since Oct. 16--after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years. The $638 million loss included $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments. A week later, it disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Fastow was forced to step down from the company last week. 

The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron's problems weren't solved by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.


In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks 
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001
By BILL WHITE 
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should now take the time to say ""thanks"" when the company has experienced some highly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Houston and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encouraged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by making a big difference in their community. 
Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it competed hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger market of electricity. The downtown concentration of these firms -- industry leaders including Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy -- led London's Financial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricity. 
This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- with the average age of Enron employees at under 35 -- and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in turn, helped revitalize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's construction of a large Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone in Houston's growth, an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space. 
Virtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities. If Enron or its chairman, Ken Lay, led a visionary effort, such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers, or more recently the private funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center, Houstonians knew it would be done right. Without Lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town. 
Employees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential, with no glass ceilings. Women have run large divisions and subsidiaries. Many military officers find that Enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers, even at ages well past normal corporate entry level. The most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them. 
Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the American dream. With the habits of work learned on a family farm in Missouri, Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the University of Houston, served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business. When Northern Natural Gas acquired the smaller Houston Natural Gas, Northern's chairman surprised folks by installing Lay as his successor. I was at Northern's headquarters in Omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when Northern's chairman reassured folks that they could count on ""best young executive in the business, Ken Lay,"" to direct their future in a changing marketplace. Within 15 years, most of Enron's revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when Lay had taken over, all of which had been created from within the firm. This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team. 
Enron rewarded innovation, while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded. Year after year, top executives throughout the country voted Enron our nation's most innovative corporation. Enron recognized, even when financial markets do not, that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes. 
Rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace, as had many American businesses, Enron welcomed the challenge of the international market, confident that American firms could compete and win. Enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship, and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line. 
Enron's phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations, as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth, forever. Enron's size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in California and India, even as Enron supplied the electricity they so needed. Sometimes it seemed the company's upstart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm's perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog. 
And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as strong people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story. 
Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live and work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to express thanks and steady support. 

White is a Houston business executive and civic leader and former government official, with no relationship to Enron.
