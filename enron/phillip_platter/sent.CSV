"NU vs. OU","Hey!

I am going to Omaha the weekend of this game.  It is one of those games every true husker fan must attend.  Let me know if ya'll may be interested or just drop me a line to let me know that you are still alive.  I think the huskers can beat OU since our D has improved so much.  I worry about the Offense not showing up on every play.
We will need a better pass rush to beat OU.  How good are we this year?  We'll find out at this game.  KSU sucks.  OUT.

"Re: Monday","I'm glad you had a good time. No mention of Pappasito's though.  Kemah is always fun, watching the boats, drinking a longneck.  We all walked in the Enron MS walk last weekend. It was fun but I had to carry Ben half of the way which gave be a better workout than I anticipated.  Had a date with Deanne Sat night . We went to ""Bridget Jones Diary"". It was a good chick movie.  Went to church and The Woodburn Tulip festival on Sunday.  Pretty neat to see fields of tulips.  

Tell the kids we love them and are looking forward to good reports on their various activities.

"Nice Article","Dear Don,

I enjoyed your article. You are right, we are a little sensitive.  That's a natural reaction when something you are so proud of is criticized.  I must admit I almost e-mailed you after reading your pre-game article.  What irritates my sensitivities is when it is pointed out that NU players have had trouble with the law.  These episodes, misdeameanors or not are not something any husker fan is proud of.  Surely there are players in every program who have fights with their girlfriends, or who drink too much and don't have the sense to leave a party when asked.  My problem is that whenever a NU player messes up, it is news.  It's as if there is a Lincoln Journal Star reporter with an office in the Lincoln PD complete with scanners, just waiting for some ""news"" to break.  I don't think ISU or any other school has such a spotlight put on them.  College kids everywhere do such things and pay for them quietly.  I don't wish we knew about every infraction at every school.  It would be nice if reporters could put things in perspective and stick to the event they are covering.  This all started when we were the defending and still contending National Champions who had the leading Heisman candidate in the backfield.  The Lawrence Phillips issue back then was news because of the Heisman hype and because of the severity of his offense.  He became the posterboy for abuse of females, and perhaps rightfully so, but enough already.  Leave us alone until, God forbid, we end up with another Lawrence Phillips.

Before I ramble on about this sensitive issue.  Let me thank you for your post game article which was fair and balanced.  You are right, Most NU fans are good, a few of us are not good fans or role models.   NU fans continue to wish ISU and Iowa the best.  Most of us are happy to see the Iowa teams do well.  Take care.

Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B.   His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.  I beat Jeff in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.   We were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense.  Personally, I quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed.  I thought he was a little weird.  He did show up to Mitch's visitation which meant alot to me.  I would support Siegrist.  Do not forward this to anyone.

Venue will once again be Harrahs Reno due to the close proximity of the fine area amenities.  Uncle Johnny will be unable to make it due to having dinner guests in from Barrington.

August 28, 2001 
Hi Everyone! 
I'm writing to tell you about an adventure I've committed to this fall! I've registered to participate in the Komen Portland Race for the Cure on September 16th. The Race benefits the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and supports the Komen Foundation's mission of eradicating breast cancer as a life-threatening disease by advancing research, education, screening and treatment.
Last year's Portland Race was the most successful ever - more than 40,000 women, men and children participated and helped raise more than $1.5 million for the fight against breast cancer! And while a number of strides have been made in breast cancer research and treatment, the fact remains that approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime. And although much less common, men also get breast cancer. That's why I'm racing for a cure.
The Race is especially important to me because my step-mother, Carol Cutsforth, died from complications associated with her breast cancer on January 14th, 2000. I am personally contributing to this cause, because I have seen first hand how this disease can cause a life time of suffering and sorrow for those who were close to breast cancer victims, and more than ever I want to help find a cure and help those who are in the fight for their life. 
You can join me in my fight against breast cancer without even breaking a sweat!
Would you please consider at least a $5 pledge to support my effort & The Komen Foundation?
My personal goal is to raise $1000.
Donations must be received by October 18th, 2001.
Your contribution is tax-deductible.
The tax number ID of the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susan G. Koman Breast Canver Foundation is 93-1068897.
Receipts will be issued for contributions of $100 or more, or upon request.
Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this opportunity. Please contact me if you have any questions, want to learn more about the Komen Portland Race for the Cure, or if you'd like to join us on September 16th!
Thanks again!
Diane Cutsforth

"RE: Request for Update on FSP Testing","Dave,

Went OK.  I gave Susan a few issues that need to be worked on.

1) Imports/Exports do not seem to be getting captured inFSP.
2)SC trades - some ponts other than CAlifornia were being captured.

Some progress was made on Generation.  If entered in Enpower correctly,they appear in FSP. The only problem is once we enter deals in enpower at detailed points, The enpower to caps report does not balance.  We need Enpower to caps to be reformulated to include all NP SP and ZP deals including those at detailed points like sdg1,pandol_6_unit, etc.

The 10day test for day ahead is done as far as i'm concerned.  Susan was running template comparisons for the 1st thru the 3rd. which may need some work on our part.

Dear Friends! 

I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas holiday...it went by fast and 
it's always a crazy time.  The kids had a blast with all of their new 
gifts and gadgets that required frequent battery installation so the 
house has been busy...and noisy.  (what kind of relative would buy the 
noisiest toys in the store?!) 

The best part of our holiday is that I became engaged on Christmas Eve. 
It was a wonderfully planned proposal and I received a beautiful 
engagement ring. The fellows' name is Brad Bailor and he is a wonderful 
man .  We are very happy and plan a wedding sometime in July. 

I just couldn't wait to share our news! 

I hope all is well with all of you and Happy New Year! 

Love, Lisa

Good to hear from you, Plat-oid.

Yes, TCU was better than expected. But Huskers were below-par from what everyone has come to expect. They'll get better & I do NOT believe ND can win at Lincoln.  We'll be better than all the prognosticators think.  They all think Simms is the next coming of his dad but it is all based around hype and, unfortunately, his performance in the 3rd quarter against our secondary last year (which started a weary-ankled RS freshman CB, an All-Conference CB who could barely walk let alone cover Roy Williams, and our Safety went out in the 2nd quarter & was replaced by a transfer QB).  

RC has, over the past 3 years, stockpiled significant quality and quantity in the secondary because he saw the new trend of offense he'd need to defend. I expect our secondary to be among the best in the country this year.

I expect 8-3 at worst.  It was 8-3 until I saw CU stink it up the other night.  I figure we'll take it on the chin from KSU, OU.

McNeese W
Wyoming W
Okl ST W
ND W (we'll take out the Irish at Kyle)
Baylor W
CU W (see Saturday night--and we have the added factor of revenge from the debacle last yr at home)
KSU L 
Iowa St. W
TTech W (this is the swing game--usually some weird voodoo in the air when we go to Lubbock so who knows? Brett & I are going to this game)

yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.  Your daughter is really cute.
How will the aggies be?

Subject: Afghani - American perspective


Dear Friends, The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim
Ansary. Tamim is an Afghani-American writer. He is also one of the most
brilliant people I know in this life. When he writes, I read. When he
talks, I listen. Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we
are in. -Gary

Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread:

I've been hearing a lot of talk about ""bombing Afghanistan back to
the Stone Age."" Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that this
would mean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with
this atrocity, but ""we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage.
What else can we do?"" Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing
whether we ""have the belly to do what must be done.""

And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because
I am from Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years
I've never lost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell
anyone who will listen how it all looks from where I'm standing.
I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is
no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity
in New York.

I agree that something must be done about those monsters.
But the Taliban and Bin Laden are not Afghanistan. They're not even
the government of Afghanistan. The Taliban are a cult of ignorant
psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a political
criminal with a plan. When you think Taliban, think Nazis. When you
think Bin Laden, think Hitler. And when you think ""the people of
Afghanistan"" think ""the Jews in the concentration camps."" It's not only
that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity. They were
the first victims of the perpetrators. They would exult if someone
would come in there, take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest
of international thugs holed up in their country.

Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban?
The answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated,
suffering. A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are
500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy, no
food. There are millions of widows. And the Taliban has been burying
these widows alive in mass graves. The soil is littered with land
mines, the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets. These are a few of
the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.

We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone
Age. Trouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it already.
Make the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level their houses?
Done. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done. Eradicate their
hospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut them off from
medicine and health care? Too late. Someone already did all that.

New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs. Would they at
least get the Taliban? Not likely. In today's Afghanistan, only the
Taliban eat, only they have the means to move around. They'd slip away
and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans,
they don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying
over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the
criminals who did this horrific thing. Actually it would only be making
common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people they've
been raping all this time.

So what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with
true fear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in
there with ground troops. When people speak of ""having the belly to do
what needs to be done"" they're thinking in terms of having the belly to
kill as many as needed. Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms
about killing innocent people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand.
What's actually on the table is Americans dying. And not just because
some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin
Laden's hideout. It's much bigger than that folks. Because to get any
troops to Afghanistan, we'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let
us? Not likely. The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will
other Muslim nations just stand by?

You see where I'm going. We're flirting with a world war between
Islam and the West. And guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's
exactly what he wants. That's why he did this. Read his speeches and 
statements. It's all right there. He really believes Islam would beat
the west. It might seem ridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize
the world into Islam and the West, he's got a billion soldiers. If the
west wreaks a holocaust in those lands, that's a billion people with
nothing left to lose, that's even better from Bin Laden's point of
view. He's probably wrong, in the end the west would win, whatever that
would mean, but the war would last for years and millions would die,
not just theirs but ours. Who has the belly for that?

Bin Laden does. Anyone else?

Importance:     High 
Sensitivity:    Confidential 
This was just forwarded to me by my mom.  You definitely only want to read 
this one during some quiet time... 
17-year-old Brian Moore had only a short time to write something for the 
Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting. 
It was his turn to lead the discussion so he sat down and wrote. 
He showed the essay, titled ""The Room"" to his mother, Beth, 
before he headed out the door. 
""I wowed 'em."" he later told his father, Bruce. 
""It's a killer, It's the bomb. It's the best thing I ever wrote."" 
It also was the last. 
Brian's parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while 
cleaning out the teenager's locker at Teary Valley High School. 
Brian had been dead only hours, but his parents desperately wanted every 
piece of his life near them -- the crepe paper that had adorned his locker 
during his senior football season, notes from classmates and teachers, his 
homework. 
Only two months before, he had handwritten the essay about encountering 
Jesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teen's 
life. 
But it was only after Brian's death that Beth and Bruce Moore realized 
that their son had described his view of heaven. 
""It makes such an impact that people want to share it. You feel like you 
 are there."" Mr. Moore said. 
Brian Moore died May 27, 1997, -- the day after Memorial Day. 
 He was driving home from a friend's house when his car went off 
Bulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole. He emerged 
from the wreck unharmed but 
stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted. 
Brian seemed to excel at everything he did. He was an honor student. He told 
his parents he loved them ""a hundred times a day"", Mrs. Moore said. He was a 
star wide receiver for the Teary's Valley 
Football team and had earned a four-year scholarship to Capital University 
in Columbus because of his athletic and academic abilities. He took it upon 
himself to learn how to help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at 
school. 
During one homecoming ceremony, Brian walked on his tiptoes so that the girl 
he was escorting wouldn't be embarrassed about being taller than him. 
He adored his kid brother, Bruce, now 14. 
He often escorted his grandmother, Evelyn Moore, who lives in Columbus, to 
church. 
""I always called him the ""deep thinker"", Evelyn said of her eldest grandson. 
Two years after his death, his family still struggles to understand why 
Brian was taken from them. 
They find comfort at the cemetery where Brian is buried, just a few blocks 
from their home. They visit daily. A candle and dozens of silk and real 
flowers keep vigil over the gravesite. 
The Moore's framed a copy of Brian's essay and hung it among the family 
portraits in the living room. 
""I think God used him to make a point. I think we were meant to find it and 
make something out of it,"" Mrs. Moore said of the essay. 
She and her husband want to share their son's vision of life after death. 
""I'm happy for Brian. I know he's in heaven. I know I'll see him again 
someday."" Mrs. Moore said. 
""It just hurts so bad now."" 
 The Room... 
 In that place between wakefulness and dreams, I found myself in the room. 
There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with 
small index card files. They were like the ones in libraries that list 
titles by author or subject in alphabetical order. But these files, which 
stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction, 
had very different headings. 
As I drew near the wall of files, the first to catch my attention was one 
that read ""Girls I have liked."" 
I opened it and began flipping through the cards. 
I quickly shut it, shocked to realize that I recognized the names written 
on each one. 
And then without being told, I knew exactly where I was. 
This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my 
life. 
 Here were written the actions of my every moment, big and small, 
in a detail my memory couldn't match. 
A sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror, stirred 
within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content. 
Some brought joy and sweet memories; others a sense of shame and regret so 
intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching. 
A file named ""Friends"" 
was next to one marked 
""Friends I have betrayed."" 
The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird. 
""Books I Have Read,"" 
""Lies I Have Told,"" 
""Comfort I have Given,"" 
""Jokes I Have Laughed at."" 
Some were almost hilarious in their exactness: 
""Things I've yelled at my brothers."" 
Others I couldn't laugh at: 
""Things I Have Done in My Anger"" 
""Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents."" 
I never ceased to be surprised by the contents. 
Often there were many more cards than I expected. 
Sometimes fewer than I hoped. 
I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived. 
Could it be possible that I had the time 
in my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards? 
But each card confirmed this truth. 
Each was written in my own handwriting. 
Each signed with my signature. 
When I pulled out the file marked 
""Songs I have listened to,"" 
I realized the files grew to 
contain their contents. 
The cards were packed tightly, 
and yet after two or three yards, 
I hadn't found the end of the file. 
I shut it, shamed, not so much by the quality of music 
but more by the vast time I knew that file represented. 
When I came to a file marked 
""Lustful Thoughts,"" 
I felt a chill run through my body. 
I pulled the file out only an inch, 
not willing to test its size, 
and drew out a card. 
I shuddered at its detailed content. 
I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded. 
An almost animal rage broke on me. 
One thought dominated my mind: 
""No one must ever see these cards! 
No one must ever see this room! 
I have to destroy them!"" 
In insane frenzy I yanked the file out. 
Its size didn't matter now. 
I had to empty it and burn the cards. 
But as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor, 
I could not dislodge a single card. 
I became desperate and pulled out a card, 
only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it. 
Defeated and utterly helpless, I returned the file to its slot. 
Leaning my forehead against the wall, 
I let out a long, self-pitying sigh. 
And then I saw it. 
The title bore ""People I Have Shared the Gospel With."" 
The handle was brighter than those around it, 
newer, almost unused. 
I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches 
long fell into my hands. 
I could count the cards it contained on one hand. 
And then the tears came. 
I began to weep. 
Sobs so deep that they hurt. 
They started in my stomach and shook through me. 
I fell on my knees and cried. I cried out of shame, 
from the overwhelming shame of it all. 
The rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes. 
No one must ever, ever know of this room. 
I must lock it up and hide the key. 
But then as I pushed away the tears, 
I saw Him. 
No, please not Him. 
Not here. 
Oh, anyone but Jesus. 
I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards. 
I couldn't bear to watch His response. 
And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face, 
I saw a sorrow deeper than my own. 
He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes. 
Why did He have to read every one? 
Finally He turned and 
looked at me from across the room. 
He looked at me with pity in His eyes. 
But this was a pity that didn't anger me. 
I dropped my head, 
covered my face with my hands and began to cry again. 
He walked over and put His arm around me. 
He could have said so many things. 
But He didn't say a word. He just cried with me. 
Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files. 
Starting at one end of the room, He took out a file and, 
one by one, began to sign 
His name over mine on each card. 
""No!"" 
 I shouted rushing to Him. 
All I could find to say was 
""No, no, "" 
as I pulled the card from Him. 
His name shouldn't be on these cards. 
But there it was, 
written in red so rich, 
so dark, 
so alive. 
The name of Jesus covered mine. 
It was written with His blood. 
He gently took the card back. 
He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards. 
I don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, 
but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk 
 back to my side. 
He placed His hand on my shoulder and said, 
""It is finished."" 
I stood up, and He led me out of the room. 
There was no lock on its door. 
There were still cards to be written. 
""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" ---Phil. 4:13 
""For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, 
that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."" 
If you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you 
can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also. 
My ""People I shared the gospel with"" file just got bigger, 
how about yours?

Phil,

Here are our EES positions as of 12:00 today. Please let me know if you agree with these numbers. I marked the Palo Verde sale as an export from SP-15 on our schedule. Do you want this aggregated in SP in our EESSCTrade template? Also, my understanding is that the APX is the schedule coordinator for the New Power deal. I will not include this in the EESSCTrade template and will instead mark it separately as a sale on the APX template (part of the Daily Forecast template). Is all of this correct? Please let me know. Thanks.

Mike

"RE: UCDavis, WAPA, Enron and direct access","Dennis,

I'm attempting to understand how the UC-Davis deal, if done, will impact us .  How is this different than all of the other retail contracts that you service?
One concern that I had was if they opted to go for direct access and still had provisions to change their load on short notice(real time) this would cause some big problems for our real time group. To my knowledge, we don't currently have any contracts like this.  Is this the reason UC-Davis wasn't included in the original deal with the UC System?  Can you give me a call or an e-mail?  The number below is correct.
Thanks!

Subject:	Re: UCDavis, WAPA, Enron and direct access


Keith/Sukhi:

The following are my preliminary responses to Keith's email questions:

		?	You can not be an ""x/y"" customer under 2948A and take Direct Access (DA) service through the same meter point.  Therefore, to receive Western power and third party power (other then PG&E) as an ""end-user"" retail load you must acquire DA service from PG&E and become a ""scheduling"" customer with Western.

		?	The key steps from Western's perspective to becoming a Western ""scheduling customer"" involve modifying your Electric Service Contract and receiving agreement from PG&E.  I would think you could accomplish these two items in no less than thirty days.  You appear to be familiar with the DASR process and timing to acquire DA service from PG&E.

		?	Western does provide Scheduling Agent services and does have a rate for this service.  It is approx. $75 per hour. (HOW MANY HOURS PER DAY/MONTH WOULD BE TYPICAL CHARGE?)  Pending the outcome of the PG&E 205 Filing before FERC (pass-thru of costs incurred by PG&E under 2948A), your SC could incur the typical CAISO charges for both Western power delivery and third party energy.  You will also be billed by PG&E under their DA Tariff for delivery (wheeling).

		?	PG&E has suggested to me in a recent phone conversation that if you are taking PG&E DA service the 2948A delivery service (wheeling) would no longer apply.  (DOES THIS MEANS E20T T&D RATES APPLY TO WAPA DELIVERIES, INCLUDING SURCHARGES?)

		?	Western's scheduling customers receive monthly load factor energy as an ""energy entitlement"" (EE) based on a rolling average of their last five years of monthly historical usage.  EE are calculated using the customer's total monthly peak capacity and total monthly energy and are updated annually.  I do not believe there are any exceptions to the methodology for determining EE (i.e. 5-year rolling average); therefore, the full benefit of your increased LF these next few years will take time to be fully realized.

		?	As a scheduling customer you are required to take at least 35% of your CRD in any hour or your total load, whichever is less.  You may schedule 100% of your CRD in any hour provided you have not exceeded your EE.  There are limits to the schedule differential between hours  . . I will research and get back with you.  (PLEASE CONFIRM THAT IT IS THE CUSTOMER - OR ITS AGENT - THAT DETERMINES HOURLY SCHEDULE.  WOULD DELIVERIES BE HANDLED AS AN SC TO SC TRANSFER BETWEEN WAPA AND ENRON? IF NOT? HOW?  WHAT IS TIMING REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY WAPA OF DA HOURLY SCHEDULE? HOW ARE HOUR AHEAD CHANGES ACCOMMODATED?)

		?	I am unable to provide any thoughts on how the timing for making changes to Western power delivered to your SC for submission as a DA schedule would be handled at this time.  I will research and get back with you.

		?	As a relatively ""smaller"" customer, I do not believe that there would be much (if any) benefit to you or Western by participating in any of our load management programs.

		?	The existing Western meter set is CAISO certified and we may be able to accommodate a third party polling the meter.  I will check into it.

		?	Unsure of what you are asking in regards to ""off ramps"".  Please clarify.

Hi Russell, Bob:
Can we schedule a conference call for early next week between WAPA (Bob,
Russell, others?), UCD, our President's office (UCOP) and Enron regarding
the below info?  A WAPA/UCD meeting may also be desirable.

I understand that Sukhi has been discussing with you the possibility of
utilizing direct access (instead of PG&E bundled services) to meet our
peaking energy requirements, i.e. the difference between our total needs and
what WAPA and our cogen provide.  We are considering using the UC/CSU
blanket electricity contract with Enron to achieve direct access.

Below are some questions that we have regarding the potential switch, but we
are also extremely interested in hearing what you have to say regarding the
issues at hand.

As I understand the process, if UCD utilizes direct access (DA), then we
will have to switch from X/Y to scheduling customer status- correct?

If we have to switch to scheduling customer status, what are the key steps
and how long would each step take?
*	if we desire to switch quickly, a DASR would have to be filed with
PG&E by July 11th in order for DA service to start on August 1.
*	if above is not doable, then a DASR would have to be filed with PG&E
by Aug 11th in in order for DA service to start on September 1.

If UCD switches to scheduling status, it is likely that WAPA would be our
scheduling agent (SA) and Enron would be our scheduling coordinator (SC).
What would be the differences in charges that we would incur from WAPA based
on status quo?  Do you have any feeling for what charges would be incurred
by PG&E and ISO?

If UCD switches to DA, would our 15 MW CRD still receive the same
transmission rates under 2948A?

I understand that if we switch to scheduling status, then our energy
allocation will be fixed based on a 5 year average load factor.  How does
this math work?

How often is the 5 year average load factor updated- monthly, yearly, other?

UCD will have a new 3 MW thermal storage system on line in the next few
months which will dramatically improve our monthly load factor (total kWh
divided by product of peak demand and hr/mon).  If we are required to use 5
year average load factors instead of current load factors (as is done with
X/Y), then the economic harm to UCD appears to be in the neighborhood of
$200,000 to $250,000 per year.  I'd like to petition using a forecasted load
factor to detemine energy allocation so that this potential switch does not
harm UCD.  How would I do this?

Is the MWh energy allocation that is determined through the above process a
flat rate number that is used for each month of the year, or does it vary
month-by-month based on water availability?  I believe it is flat through
12/2004, correct?

If we switch to scheduling status and if we have so many MWh allocated for
the month, how much flexibility is there for our SC to schedule the load?
*	The max schedulable load is our CRD- correct?
*	What is the minimum schedulable load- 0 kW?
*	Are there any maximum ramp rates up or down?, i.e. can we go from 0
kW @ 7AM to 14,682 kW @ 8AM and 14,682 kW @ 9PM to 0 kW @ 10PM?
*	At what time are loads locked in? i.e. can SC change schedule 1 hr,
6 hr, 1 day before the actual hour?

As a scheduing customer, we will have the capability to join WAPA load
management programs- do you see any potential benefits to UCD?

Is our Siemens TSI Quad 4 meter available to be read by Enron?  What type of
software/hardware does WAPA use to read our meters?  Does this meter meet
ISO protocols for revenue meters?

I believe that we are planning to ask for contractual off-ramps if 2948A
becomes untenable due to FERC or bankruptcy court decisions.  Your thoughts?
Can you think of any other contractual off ramps that should be pursued?

Thanks Keith

Subject: September 11th Fund Confirmation 


Dear Phil Platter,

Thank you for your gift of $100.00 to The September 11th Fund.  The Fund was established by United Way of New York City and The New York Community Trust to respond to the immediate and longer-term needs of victims, their families, and communities affected by the tragic events of September 11, 2001.

Within 11 days of the attacks, checks were being written to victims and their families by experienced relief agencies using cash grants from The September 11th Fund.  Right now, your contribution is helping to provide emergency cash assistance, legal counseling, grief therapy, job training and placement, and other vital services for victims, families and others directly affected. Your gift is helping people and communities rebuild their lives.  

On behalf of Joshua Gotbaum, chief executive officer of The September 11th Fund, we invite you to visit http://www.september11fund.org for up-to-date information and to sign up for e-mail updates on how your contribution to The September 11th Fund is helping to fund recovery efforts.

If your employer has a matching gift program for The September 11th Fund and requires verification of your gift, this e-mail will serve as that verification.  Please contact your company's human resource or community affairs department if you have any questions. 

Again, thank you for your continued support of The September 11th Fund and of community foundations and United Ways across the country.

Sincerely,


Ralph Dickerson, Jr.
President
United Way of New York City

Subject: Life Membership Promotion


Everyone - I wanted to tell you about a new promotion that the Alumni Association has going on - the Fall Life Promotion.  Be among the first 400 people to purchase a life membership by Dec. 1, and you'll be entered in a drawing for one of the following prize packages:

*	Trip to the 2001-2002 Husker Bowl Game (One Winner)A trip for two to the 2002 Rose Bowl (or to whichever bowl the Huskers appear in) including round-trip airfare, hotel accommodations, Husker Huddle
pre-game event, game tickets and more.

*	The Ultimate Game-day Experience (Seven Winners)Each package will give the winner an ultimate game-day experience for a home football weekend in 2002.  Winners will receive two round-trip tickets 
on *Southwest Airlines, two nights' accommodations at Lincoln's Cornhusker Hotel, two game tickets and two guest passes to the Nebraska Champions Club for pre- and post-game parties.  *If the winner lives within driving distance, Southwest Airline tickets can be used any time for a round trip between two ""Southwest cities"" by Dec. 1, 2002.  

*	Gift Certificates for Husker Merchandise (20 Winners)
Winners will receive a $25 gift certificate for Husker merchandise from the Red Zone.  Thousands of choices are available in fine Husker clothing, memorabilia and accessories.

*	Benefits for a lifetime
As a life member you'll continue to receive the award-winning publications, including Nebraska Magazine, the Good NUz, the Alumni Resource Guide and your college newsletter.  In addition, you'll receive highest 
consideration when ordering football tickets for  selected members-only football games each fall.  You'll also have the opportunity to request up to 
four tickets for these select games rather than two.  Your life membership supports an endowment to offer programs that further the mission of the university and enhance the quality of student life.  In addition, these programs keep alumni and friends involved and informed.  Be a part of that effort and purchase a life membership today.

The quest for 400 new life members through the fall promotion officially kicked off on Wednesday, August 15.  The first 400 new life or paying life members who join between August 15 and December 1 will automatically be considered for the fantastic promotional prize drawing to be held in early December.  

An individual can qualify for the drawing by joining as a new life/paying life member or by upgrading from an annual membership to a life/paying life
membership.  Current life and paying life members who joined between July 15 and August 15 will also be considered for the drawing, BUT they must first call 
the Association at 888-353-1874 to indicate their interest in being included.  Be sure to use our chapter code ORE when completing the membership form.

I have attached a membership form for your use or find out more about the Alumni Association by going to www.unl.edu/alumni.  Good luck in the drawing!

"RE: Cornholios","yeah,  the Offense was very unhuskerlike, except for Crouch, He had 150 yards passing which was fairly good.  The line was not ready for such an aggressive D this early.  I do think TCU has a great Defense as evidenced by their #1 Defense ranking last year. Evidently they had some depth as well becasue they lost half of their starters to Graduation/NFL.  The bright spot was the Defense giving up only 165 yards of TOTal yards.  their only score came on a broken play that went for 67yards.  We were also lucky that Casey Printers pulled a muscle on that play.  We played 2 true freshman alot on the D and they were very good.  The D should be faster and more aggressive than last year.  The Domers think they have a chance now that we only scored 21 on TCU.  I say TCU is better than people think, but I'm glad we didn't open with NotreDame.  I got your pictures.  Your daughter is really cute.

Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B.   His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.  I beat Jeff in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.   We were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense.  Personally, I quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed.  I thought he was a little weird.  He did show up to Mitch's visitation which meant alot to me.  I would support Siegrist.  Do not forward this to anyone.

Phil
Can you do me a favor and check to see if the 1-31 files are posted to Sparky before you leave tonight and then again tomorrow?  I'm curious to see if they somehow disappear overnight or if I'm just dreaming when think I post them daily.  I always check to make sure the files got across before I exit the program, so I can think of no reason why they would not be there when you open the site.  Please let me know and thanks.
Michael

"FW: Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Ken Lay - Chairman & CEO@ENRON

To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy


The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Hey Dave,

Of course I remember you! And you were right, Saturday the 25th was my birthday(37).  I feel especially old
now that I am surrounded by 24year olds.  I wish some old people like you were still around.

How dou you like Phoenix? and SRP?
And how is your family getting along?

I have 3 kids now.  The last one is 19 mos old. I am done. 
We have more and more people around here.  I am the last of the ""Texans"" . The rest all went back to Houston.  Brett Hunsucker went to ERCOT in Austin.  I think he likes it.  Miller and Forney and Smith Day are all working for Enron on the ERCOT desk.
I can't trade this place for Houston.
Drop me a line Dave. Its been good to hear from you!

"FW: new deals 5/24 revised","Somehow the commucication on these deals got fubared.  I've gone with the assumption that we bought 3mw NP15 and !2 sp15 at 295 and $280 respectively for June. Did this happen?  If the idea was to flatten EES out , we should have sold to them.  Any insight would be appreciated.

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

The executive committee met at the Lantern last night and it is confirmed that Ski Trip 2002 will take place January 30th - February 3rd at Lake Tahoe.  Venue will once again be Harrahs Reno due to the close proximity of the fine area amenities.  Uncle Johnny will be unable to make it due to having dinner guests in from Barrington.  However, the committee did approve of opening up the roster to additional participants.  Call me for details.

To:	All US DOMESTIC & EXPAT EMPLOYEES@ENRON
Subject:	PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

 I just wanted to drop you all a note and let you know that I arrived  safe and sound into Dulles Airport tonight at about 6:00. It was an interesting  flight. The airport in Denver was almost spooky, it was so empty and quiet. No  one was in line for the security check point when I got there so that went  fairly quickly, just x-ray of my bags and then a chemical test to be sure  nothing explosive was on them. Then I waited 2 1/2 hours to board the plane.  What happened after we boarded was interesting and thought I would share it with  you. The pilot/captain came on the  loudspeaker after the doors were closed. His speech went like this:  First  I want to thank you for being brave enough to fly today. The doors are now  closed and we have no help from the outside for any problems that might occur  inside this plane. As you could tell when you checked in, the government has  made some changes to increase security in the airports. They have not, however,  made any rules about what happens after those doors close. Until they do that,  we have made our own rules and I want to share them with you. Once those doors  close, we only have each other. The security has taken care of a threat like  guns with all of the increased scanning, etc. Then we have the supposed bomb. If  you have a bomb, there is no need to tell me about it, or anyone else on this  plane; you are already in control. So, for this flight, there are no bombs that  exist on this plane. Now, the threats that are left are things like plastics,  wood, knives, and other weapons that can be made or things like that which can  be used as weapons. Here is our plan and our rules. If someone or several people  stand up and say they are hijacking this plane, I want you all to stand up  together. Then take whatever you have available to you and throw it at them.  Throw ! it at their faces and heads so they will have to raise their hands to  protect themselves. The very best protection you have against knives are the  pillows and blankets. Whoever is close to these people should then try to get a  blanket over their head--then they won't be able to see. Once that is done, get  them down and keep them there. Do not let them up. I will then land the plane at  the closest place and we WILL take care of them. After all, there are usually  only a few of them and we are 200+ strong! We will not allow them to take over  this plane. I find it interesting that the US Constitution begins with the words  ""We, the people""--that's who we are, THE people and we will not be  defeated. With that, the passengers  on the plane all began to applaud, people had tears in their eyes, and we began  the trip toward the runway. The  flight attendant then began the safety speech. One of the things she said is  that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a fast pace. She asked that  everyone turn to their neighbors on either side and introduce themselves, tell  each other something about your families and children, show pictures, whatever.  She said ""for today, we consider you family. We will treat you as such and ask  that you do the same with us."" Throughout the flight we learned that for the crew, this was their first  flight since Tuesday's tragedies. It was a day that everyone leaned on each  other and together everyone was stronger than any one person alone. It was quite  an experience. You can imagine the  feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles and we heard ""welcome to  Washington Dulles Airport, where the local time is 5:40"". Again, the cabin was  filled with applause. It has been a  very long day and one that I am glad is over. I have been constantly reminded  this day of the ar! ticle in JAAMT that Barbara Williams recently wrote where  she referenced the tornados in Oklahoma and said something like, ""Do we get mad  and shake our fists at God in anger? No, we go on and conquer our fears and  continue our lives."" It is my hope that is what we do now. Last night I saw a  program with college students where one of them said that at their campus there  are no more hyphenated titles, i.e., African-American, etc., everyone is just an  American. No one will ever be able to take that pride away from  us.

Subject: American Heart Walk



Hello everybody. You'll recall last year I raised over two thousand dollars for the American Heart Association in honor of my good friend Mitch Platter who died of a heart attack in last February.  He was only 36.  The actual diagnosis was something called ""left main disease"", but for you and me that just means a clogged artery at a very young age.  He left a beautiful wife and four great kids.  He was the best man in my wedding.  We even went to kindergarten together.     

While I can't bring my friend back, I can do something small to help fight heart disease and stroke.  The American Heart Association, along with the USG Corporation, is again holding its annual Heart Walk America in Grant Park on September 14th, and I'll be walking in the event.  Since the walk is on a Friday, most people can't take time off work to participate.  But you can take part by sponsoring me for this walk. 

I'm asking each person to consider a $25.00 pledge, but any amount will do.  Please e-mail back letting me know the amount you wish to pledge or call me at (312) 606-4507 and just leave a message.  Your donation is tax deductible to the extent provided by law.  I'll send each of you a return envelope and receipt for your tax records.  Thanks again for supporting the American Heart Association.

"June","I entered all the Mega deals in CAPS. We have them for at least another Month.  I also updated the excel sheet for Mega and created a JUNE folder. June 1 file is also set up in that folder.  I have not pulled the June data into that file.  I have not checked out with anyone for June.  They will be ready to '
check out on Tuesday.  Make a point to call CRC and get any sc trades they have.

Callaway is a new deal we have .  The info I have is that it will be a sale for 9MW flat every day for 5years.  This is an EES deal. and will need to be entered on the EES sheet and entered on CAPS.  I think APX1 will be the SC.  Foster and Richter know about this deal. Just make sure it is accounted for as an EES deal, it will not appear in Enpower.

There is a wind deal that Elliot did with Edwards Air Force Base.  I don't have enough info on this yet. It starts June 1.

 I just wanted to drop you all a note and let you know that I arrived  safe and sound into Dulles Airport tonight at about 6:00. It was an interesting  flight. The airport in Denver was almost spooky, it was so empty and quiet. No  one was in line for the security check point when I got there so that went  fairly quickly, just x-ray of my bags and then a chemical test to be sure  nothing explosive was on them. Then I waited 2 1/2 hours to board the plane.  What happened after we boarded was interesting and thought I would share it with  you. The pilot/captain came on the  loudspeaker after the doors were closed. His speech went like this:  First  I want to thank you for being brave enough to fly today. The doors are now  closed and we have no help from the outside for any problems that might occur  inside this plane. As you could tell when you checked in, the government has  made some changes to increase security in the airports. They have not, however,  made any rules about what happens after those doors close. Until they do that,  we have made our own rules and I want to share them with you. Once those doors  close, we only have each other. The security has taken care of a threat like  guns with all of the increased scanning, etc. Then we have the supposed bomb. If  you have a bomb, there is no need to tell me about it, or anyone else on this  plane; you are already in control. So, for this flight, there are no bombs that  exist on this plane. Now, the threats that are left are things like plastics,  wood, knives, and other weapons that can be made or things like that which can  be used as weapons. Here is our plan and our rules. If someone or several people  stand up and say they are hijacking this plane, I want you all to stand up  together. Then take whatever you have available to you and throw it at them.  Throw ! it at their faces and heads so they will have to raise their hands to  protect themselves. The very best protection you have against knives are the  pillows and blankets. Whoever is close to these people should then try to get a  blanket over their head--then they won't be able to see. Once that is done, get  them down and keep them there. Do not let them up. I will then land the plane at  the closest place and we WILL take care of them. After all, there are usually  only a few of them and we are 200+ strong! We will not allow them to take over  this plane. I find it interesting that the US Constitution begins with the words  ""We, the people""--that's who we are, THE people and we will not be  defeated. With that, the passengers  on the plane all began to applaud, people had tears in their eyes, and we began  the trip toward the runway. The  flight attendant then began the safety speech. One of the things she said is  that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a fast pace. She asked that  everyone turn to their neighbors on either side and introduce themselves, tell  each other something about your families and children, show pictures, whatever.  She said ""for today, we consider you family. We will treat you as such and ask  that you do the same with us."" Throughout the flight we learned that for the crew, this was their first  flight since Tuesday's tragedies. It was a day that everyone leaned on each  other and together everyone was stronger than any one person alone. It was quite  an experience. You can imagine the  feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles and we heard ""welcome to  Washington Dulles Airport, where the local time is 5:40"". Again, the cabin was  filled with applause. It has been a  very long day and one that I am glad is over. I have been constantly reminded  this day of the ar! ticle in JAAMT that Barbara Williams recently wrote where  she referenced the tornados in Oklahoma and said something like, ""Do we get mad  and shake our fists at God in anger? No, we go on and conquer our fears and  continue our lives."" It is my hope that is what we do now. Last night I saw a  program with college students where one of them said that at their campus there  are no more hyphenated titles, i.e., African-American, etc., everyone is just an  American. No one will ever be able to take that pride away from  us.

"FW: Resume' - Phillip Platter- Enron Power Marketing","Mr. Ried,

I thought I'd drop you a line to inquire about the energy marketer position you have had open.  I understand you had the position open internally and that if you did not find a qualified candidate you would consider outside candidates.  I am currently awaiting an offer from UBS, the new owner of Enron's wholesale trading assets.  I want to reiterate my desire to return to Omaha and  to work for OPPD.  Please let me know of the status of your search for an energy marketer.
I can be reached on my cell at 503-701-9736.

Thanks!

This is so uplifting and appropriate for today, even though it was originally broadcast by Gordon Sinclair (a Canadian radio broadcaster) nearly 30 years ago (1973)!
