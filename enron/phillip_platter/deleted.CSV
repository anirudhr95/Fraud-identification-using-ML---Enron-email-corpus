"CAISO Notice - Final Cutover to New EMS System","MARKET NOTICE
January 7, 2002
New CAISO Energy Management System (EMS) Cutover
ISO Market Participants: 
On Sunday, December 30, 2001, the California ISO cutover its grid operations
to a new Energy Management System (EMS).  The EMS is a computer-based system
used to monitor the real-time performance of the various elements of an
electric system, and to control generation and manage transmission
facilities. The system monitors electric transmission grid status, energy
flowing from power plants, adjusts the output of plants in response to
changes in power demand on the Grid, communicates with ISO scheduling
systems and reports on plant outages.
The implementation and final cutover of the new EMS into production was the
culmination of a year-long effort of the CAISO, in partnership with ABB
Network Management of Houston, Texas, to replace the previous CAISO Energy
Management System.

"CAISO NOTICE:  Market Design 2002 (MD02)","ISO Market Participants:

As you know, the ISO has scheduled four Focus Group meetings on January
14-17 to present the Market Design 2002 (MD02) preliminary design.  Although
we have suggested primary stakeholder groups for each meeting, the focus
groups are completely open.  We have structured the meetings as focus
groups, rather than large stakeholder meetings, for two primary reasons:

*	We have better communication with smaller groups (~20) than with
larger groups (~75).  The ISO used this approach in a recent series of
meetings on uninstructed deviation pricing and had very good success.

*	We expect to have better-focused discussions by concentrating those
with similar interests into the same meetings.

The ISO does not want to exclude any stakeholder and would like any
interested entity to participate in one of the four meetings.  If your
organization is not represented directly by one of the four identified
stakeholder groups, you may attend whichever meeting you desire.  We do ask
that entities participate (either attend or actively participate by
conference call) in only one meeting, although you may listen in to as many
as you desire.  If you would like to attend one of the meetings, please RSVP
to my Assistant, Julia Payton at jpayton@caiso.com or (916) 608-7069.

"GCP/PLP Phase 3 Telemetry Requirements","MARKET NOTICE
January 8, 2002
GCP/PLP Phase 3 Telemetry Requirements
Intended Audience:  Participating Generators and Loads, Scheduling
Coordinators, technology vendors, other interested parties
On July 18, 2001, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) sent a
formal notice to Market Participants identifying the Monitoring and
Communication Requirements for Generating Units providing only Energy and
Supplemental Energy other than Ancillary Services (A/S) and/or Regulation
(Generator Communication Project/Participating Load Program (GCP/PLP) -
Phase 3).  This requires each affected Generator to install equipment and
software that can interface with the ISO's Energy Management System (EMS) to
supply telemetered data by June 1, 2002.
The GCP/PLP Phase 3 telemetry requirement was first introduced during the
GCP/PLP Meeting held on March 8, 2001.  The Phase 3 technical standards
developed by the Direct Telemetry Working Group (DTWG) were reviewed at the
May 22, 2001 GCP/PLP Meeting and an implementation goal of June 1, 2002 was
introduced.  Subsequently, the installation deadline of June 1, 2002 for
Phase 3 was communicated during the October 9, 2001 GCP/PLP Meeting.  The
work required to install and test equipment and software that can supply
telemetered data to the ISO's EMS must be completed by June 1, 2002.  After
that date, Generating Units 10 MW or greater in rated capacity that do not
meet the ISO's telemetry requirements may be precluded from scheduling
Energy or Supplemental Energy with the ISO.  The Phase 3 GCP/PLP
requirements are posted on the ISO web site at; 
http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/gcp/requirements.html
<http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/gcp/requirements.html>  .
Generating Units that installed a Remote Intelligent Gateway (RIG) or Data
Processing Gateway (DPG) have fulfilled this requirement if all affected
units are visible to the ISO and have been verified by ISO personnel.
If you have any questions or concerns about the Phase 3 telemetry
requirements, please feel free to call the ISO Client Representative for the
GCP/PLP, Dave Timson at (916) 608-7065.
