> 	On August 30, 2001, the ISO distributed a notice indicating that it

> trade month, the ISO temporarily halted issuance of the preliminary
> invoices entirely.  Subsequently, the ISO issued a single monthly invoice
> on the date that it issued the Final Settlement Statement for the last
> Trade Day of the calendar month. Thus, the ISO neither collected nor
> dispersed funds until the final invoice was distributed.  
> 	This suspension of the ""two invoice"" settlements approach was a
> temporary action.  The ISO will resume issuing Preliminary Invoices

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Layoffs","Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

"Nebraska Recruiting","This just in (at 1pm Central Time) --
 
High School All-American runningback David Horne from Omaha Central choose Nebraska over Michigan.  He also considered Notre Dame, Colorado, and Iowa.
 
Needless to say, this is a huge get for the Huskers.
 
 
From today's Lincoln Journal Star:
 
Omaha Central's David Horne, ranked by rivals100.com as the nation's No. 6 running back, has scheduled a 1 p.m. press conference today at his school to announce his decision. He recently narrowed his list to Nebraska and Michigan. 

""I think he'll end up at Nebraska,"" Central Coach Joe McMenamin said Tuesday night. ""But he's got a cousin at Michigan, and that plays into it. The one thing David knows is he wants to make his decision and be done with it."" 

The 6-foot, 195-pound Horne runs the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds and has a 34-inch vertical leap. He recently canceled recruiting trips to Iowa and Notre Dame after eliminating Colorado as a finalist.

"CAISO Notice - Changes to RMR Conformed Dispatch Notice","
MARKET NOTICE
January 17, 2002
Changes to RMR Conformed Dispatch Notice
ISO Market Participants
SC Settlement Contacts
Effective February 1, 2002 the ISO will implement an updated version of the
Conformed Dispatch Notice (CDN) that is sent to RMR Generator Owners and
Participating Transmission Owners.  We have added eight new columns to the
end of the CDN to provide a way to document Voltage Support and Unit
Substitution.  Attached to this Notice is a sample CDN to illustrate these
changes.
The first additional column on the CDN, VOLT SUPP, will be used as a flag to
determine whether or not a unit has been called for Voltage Support.  A ""0""
in this field will signify the unit was not dispatched for Voltage Support,
and a ""1"" will signify the unit was dispatched for Voltage Support.  The
second additional column, VOLT SUPP MW, will be used to record how much
energy is associated with a Real Time Voltage Support dispatch given to
Non-Synchronous Condensers.  This column will contain a positive value,
which signifies the amount of energy that the unit needs to decrease its
Market Schedule.
The next six columns, SUB UNIT1, SUB UNIT1 MW, SUB UNIT2, SUB UNIT2 MW, SUB
UNIT3, SUB UNIT3 MW, will be used to list the Unit ID(s) and number of MWs
that were substituted for the Unit with the original Dispatch Notice.  These
six additional columns will record each unit(s) that was(were) substituted
and how much energy was generated hourly.
The modifications to the CDN will not affect any other systems, since there
are no formulas associated with these columns. 
If you have any questions, please call or e-mail any of the following ISO
contacts:

"Cali Scheduling Sheets","The new California Scheduling sheet is located at

P:\Trading\California\EES\joh2\SCH

There are 2 sheets, one for Newco and one for the Estate.  If you could please test out the Estate sheet and make sure it correlates correctly with the current old sheet, that would be greatly appreciated.  Both sheets point to different databases. 

There is still the known ""holiday bug"" where all holidays from 2002 and on will not show up correctly.  THis will be fixed in the new upcoming sheet.

The Newco sheet seems to work but there is no valid data in the Enpower database (all data for newco in the Enpower database has been truncated).  Hopefully, Phil and I will have the new system up and running before we have to revert back to the old Newco sheet.

What better way to start the new year than with new advancements in technology. That's why we've developed new leading-edge technologies and standards to deliver increased PC performance. So whether it's the newest Pentium
 4 processor, which is the first desktop chip to be manufactured on the 0.13-micron process, the versatile Intel
 845 chipset, or our advancements in the PC platform, the end result is always an improved computing experience.

The latest generation in microprocessing <http://intel.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB5171890317X1183647X89215X>	  The latest generation in microprocessing <http://a676.g.akamaitech.net/f/676/773/60m/images.m0.net/catcontent/intelHC/010702/hed1.gif>	
Building a powerful desktop processor requires an equally potent manufacturing process: Intel's 0.13-micron process technology. The key to this latest in cutting-edge technology is the incredibly small size of the transistors - roughly 1/1000th the width of a human hair. Not only are smaller transistors faster, but more can fit onto a single processor, which makes for a higher level of performance at less power. The first Pentium
 4 processor to be built on this technology, at 2.2 GHz, not only offers significant performance gains in internet, gaming, and productivity, but also gives you the headroom to take advantage of new technologies and applications in the future.

Find out more about the Pentium 4 processor with the advanced new process technology. <http://intel.m0.net/m/s.asp?HB5171890317X1183648X89215X>

"EES CA SCHEDULE for 12/16 and 12/17/01","The attached schedules have been generated with adjustment factors to reflect apparent over-estimation of customer loads, based on an analysis of EES meter data by Tim Coffing and on comparisons of past metered loads to previous  forecasts produced.  The impact of the adjustments lowers load totals by averages of approximately 100 mW in the NP15 zone and another 50-60 mW in the SP15 zone.  These adjustments, which will continue to be refined with further analysis, have been discussed with Tim.  Please call if you have any questions regarding these changes.

Can you do me a favor and check to see if the 1-31 files are posted to Sparky before you leave tonight and then again tomorrow?  I'm curious to see if they somehow disappear overnight or if I'm just dreaming when think I post them daily.  I always check to make sure the files got across before I exit the program, so I can think of no reason why they would not be there when you open the site.  Please let me know and thanks.

"CAISO Notice - CAISO Antivirus Program","MARKET NOTICE
December 5, 2001
CAISO Antivirus Program
ISO Market Participants:
As you know, yesterday (December 4, 2001) hundreds of thousands of e-mail
users were hit  by the ""Goner"" worm virus.  Unfortunately, e-mail messages
from the ISO inadvertently spread this virus to many of your work stations.
The ISO is very concerned that it not spread such viruses either within the
CAISO or to the ISO's Market Participants.  We sincerely regret any
inconvenience this may have caused you.  
Several Market Participants have asked about the ISO's procedures for
protecting against and responding to computer virus attacks.  We would like
to update you on our procedures that allow the ISO to detect a virus,
isolate it  quickly, implement countermeasures until the antivirus upgrade
is available and clean and restore our systems (servers and PCs).
The California ISO sends and receives thousands of electronic messages every
day because of who we are and what we do.  During the normal course of
business, the majority of these messages contain attachments exchanging and
providing information.  One method used by malicious programs (Viruses,
Worms, and Trojan-Horses) to spread is by electronic mail.
It is the attachment that carries the malicious program, not the email
itself.  So, when a user opens an infected executable file, the malicious
program is activated and initiates what it is programmed to do.  Examples of
executable files that may be infected include, but not limited to, Word
documents (.doc), Excel spreadsheets (.xls), or Visual Basic files (.vbs).
CAISO's Antivirus Program uses a three-tiered approach where scanning
(detect, clean or delete) is performed on email messages with attachments at
the Gateway Servers, the Mail Servers, and Users' PCs and Laptops.  All
incoming and outgoing email with attachments are scanned for all known
viruses.
That is a key element of an antivirus program.  New viruses or new strains
of computer viruses, worms, and Trojan-Horses are discovered at an alarming
rate.  Antivirus manufacturers try to keep up with the new discoveries and
try to be the first to market with the updates.  There are over 50,000 known
active viruses circulating the Internet today.
On December 4, CAISO experienced a malicious program--Goner Worm--attack
that contaminated our electronic mailing system sometime around 8:30 a.m.
The Goner Worm was a brand new program so our antivirus software was unable
to detect it.  Antivirus software manufacturers discovered this worm on
December 4, between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m.  Later that day, most manufacturers
developed an update to address the Goner Worm.  CAISO received the new
update around 12:00 p.m. and by 3: 30 p.m. our Antivirus Team had our email
system fully restored and functional.
Unfortunately, during the time it took to recover (about 5.5 hours), many
messages were sent out automatically.  We apologize for any inconvenience
this may have caused you.  

CAISO strongly recommends that all users take prudent measures to protect
themselves from malicious program contamination.  Precautions all users
should consider include:
*	Unsolicited email messages with attachments from unknown origins
should not be opened, but deleted. 
*	When in doubt, DELETE. 
*	All email attachments must be scanned before opening. 
*	Ensure that your antivirus software is updated regularly and often.
Although we are confident that our precautions ensure virus free
attachments, it is always prudent to always scan the attachments with your
own antivirus software.  Please contact your internal IT security department
for additional information regarding your antivirus program and procedures.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Enron Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron"," 
Ex Government Affairs staff Guerrero and Cantrell are mentioned in this ....

December 12, 2001
Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron
By DAVID BARBOZA
OUSTON, Dec. 7 - After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron (news/quote) has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.

They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.

Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here?

""Innovative is a clich?, but that's what Enron was,"" Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. ""This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal.""

Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.

It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.

In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.

Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it ""didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity.""

Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job.

Under Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, the company tested new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace.

""You could come up with an idea and get people excited,"" said Janel Guerrero, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly.

""You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover,"" she added. 

Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a price. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix (news/quote), its spinoff water company. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.

""When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it was innovative,"" Mr. Rigney said. ""When people said, `We'll trade water and waste water - that's the future,' we said, `That's cool.' I didn't hear dissent in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it made my head throb.""

Indeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, it was buzzing with new ventures.

""I just got here five months ago,"" said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attending a Houston job fair. ""I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rolling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight.""

If inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and management arrogance.

""It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon,"" said Harvey J. Padewer, president of energy services at Duke Energy (news/quote), a big utility. ""They created a kill-and-eat culture.""

Mr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. ""People tried to take work away from you,"" he said. ""There was a Darwinism for ideas, for projects.""

That undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-term effect on the bottom line.

Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. ""There were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things differently,"" said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. ""I was one of the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief.""

For all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote), a stodgy Houston electric utility.

""They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska,"" one former Enron employee said. ""We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked.""

After the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up and wondering.

""I don't think Enron will ever be recreated,"" Mr. Shankman said on Thursday, sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at Enron. ""Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early.""

Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.

Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meantime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites. Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how, for a brief time, they thought they were part of something special.

""Enron was what I thought epitomized a global `American Dream' of sorts,"" wrote Kathy Walthall, a former Enron contractor. ""By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron. The environment was an extreme rush. Very busy, very progressive and innovative.""

But Ms. Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly.

""I really hope the company turns around,"" she wrote. ""But I know it will never be the same.""

"All Employee Meeting - 1:00 p.m.; Wednesday, November 28","Please plan to meet at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday for an informal question/answer session.  The best place to gather is in the rows between Trading and Origination.  Chris Calger will not be in the office on Wednesday, so I will be conducting the session.

At this point I do not have any significant new information about our company status, but I will relay the latest information that I have.  I know there are many rumors swirling around right now.  I will try to answer any questions that people have.  It would be helpful if people would submit questions in advance.  Although this is not a requirement for asking questions, it would be helpful if you would email questions/rumors to Julie Kearney before the meeting.

Please let me or Debra know if you have any questions.

"CAISO Notice - Publication of Real Time Energy Information","MARKET NOTICE
November 2, 2001
Publication of Real Time Energy Information

ISO Market Participants
SC Settlement Contacts
Currently, although Scheduling Coordinators are charged for Real Time Energy
purchases above Market Clearing Price (MCP), including Out of Market (OOM),
they see very limited energy price information until they receive their
Preliminary Settlement Statements 38 days after the Trade Date. The
Preliminary Settlement Statement shows:
*	the total dollars spent procuring imbalance energy over the MCP;
*	the total MWh of deviations; and
*	their own deviations. 
	But, the statement does not show hourly average prices above MCP or
hourly MWh purchases for above-MCP quantities.  This information is a key
factor both in facilitating SCs' ability to validate their Settlement
Statements and in providing increased transparency to real time energy
prices.
	On November 5, 2001, the ISO will begin publishing on OASIS,
consistent with ISO Governing Board direction, additional information about
real time energy purchases, both BEEP and OOM. We plan to publish the
following data:
*	Average Incremental and Decremental volume and price calculated
using BEEP, Out of Sequence (OOS) and OOM data hourly and published the day
after Trade Day.  This data will usually be available daily by 0800 to 1000,
although the initial release on November 5 to be during the afternoon.
*	Average Incremental and Decremental volume and price calculated
using BEEP, OOS and OOM data by 10-minute interval published seven days
after Trade Day;
*	Average hourly Ex-Post Energy price (includes inc and dec)
calculated consistent with BEEP only published the day after Trade Day; and.
*	Average hourly Ex-Post Energy price (includes inc and dec)
calculated consistent with BEEP only Ex-post by interval published seven
days after Trade Day.
Initially, the ISO will publish only current data.  However, we are planning
to publish historical data, as well, as time permits to validate and publish
the historical average prices.
We have posted a screen shot (with artificial data) at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/01/2000060109560313721.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/06/01/2000060109560313721.html>  showing
what the actual OASIS page will look like.

"FW: Estate/NETCO split test - additional info","Good Morning Phil & Jeff,

This email is to confirm the information from Susan below.  In a nutshell, we will bring an empty version of CAPS over to NETCO to use in an ""emergency"".  I'll also try to call you guys to confirm over the phone but in case I don't get a hold of you I wanted to at least send out an email.

On the FSP front, we are actively testing everyday.

Also, a final reminder, the database names for ESTATE are changing this weekend.  So, if your still using the Winston ""pull"" from the CAL-SHEET you will need to change the connect string.

OLD = pwrprodn_ded
NEW = estpwrpn

Have a good one,  Poston

David,

Just wanted you to give you a temperature reading of this office.  You might want to touch base with Richter (and maybe Phil) about us going straight to FSP with NETCO.  They want to make sure that we have an empty version of CAPS to use in case of an ""emergency"".  Serena has been positive/optimistic about us going straight to FSP.  Neither Chris nor Bill have expressed concerns (to me that is).

Susan

"Today's FERC Meeting","Summary of today's meeting from our trade association and a news article picked up by Steve Hall.

GAC 

FYI.  At today's FERC meeting two sets of items were voted out that pertain directly to the CA markets.  This summary is based upon the discussion at the meeting, and the actual orders will contain additional details that may not be reflected here.  A subsequent email will circulate with links to the FERC orders once they are posted.

1)  FERC voted out an order granting in part, and denying in part, the Reliant / Mirant complaint against CAISO.  The order builds on the 11/7 creditworthiness order and finds that DWR is a Scheduling Coordinator, that it should not have access to confidential information not also available to others, and that DWR should be scheduling and operating pursuant to the CAISO tariff.

During the discussion on this item, Massey noted concern about CAISO allegation that the BEEP stack is not reliable b/c generators are not following dispatch instructions.  Massey wants CAISO to promptly inform the Commission where they believe an entity is not complying with the tariff or failing to follow the dispatch instruction.

2) The second set of orders involves three dockets: (a) a new 206 rulemaking regarding market-based rate authority; (b) revision of the market power test, made in the context of a triennial review of market based rate authority; and (c) a narrow exemption to the FERC market mitigation for entities with market power pursuant to the order in (b).

FERC is putting out a new rulingmaking regarding market-based rate authority to close what they find to be a flaw with existing tariffs in the wake of California's problems.  The rulemaking initiated today calls for the imposition of a refund provision in all market-based rates.  The refund requirement attaches to ""bad behavior"" such as economic or physical withholding or other anticompetitive actions.  Apparently there is a portion of the rulemaking that asks for comments within 15 days.  During discussion, Massey pointed out that no ""bad behavior"" was found in California, and that customers should not be forced to bear the burden where the market goes out of control.

FERC has revised the market power analysis used to support a request for market-based rate authority.  FERC is now establishing a ""supply margin analysis"" (SMA) to replace the ""hub & spoke"" analysis used to determine the presence of market power.  The SMA looks for ""pivotal"" suppliers based on peak demand within a market.  The definition of the market would recognize the role of transmission constraints.  A generator is considered ""pivotal"" where its supply is required to meet system peak demand.  If such status is found, the market-based rate authority does not extend to those peak conditions, and instead the applicable rates are a cost-based rate that is applicable only to the uncommitted unit capacity.  Rates for any such capacity would be posted in INCs and DECs for that uncommitted capacity.  This policy revision occurs in the context of a triennial review of market based rate authority for AEP, Southern and Entergy.  Additional details will be in the order and we'll send an email
with links when it gets posted.

The last item would create a narrow exemption to the application of SMA and maket power mitigation in the case where the supplier is in a ISO or RTO with existing, FERC-approved market mitigation mechanisms.  While this order was to be adopted along with the other two noted above, it was held for some revisions and is expected to come out either later today or tomorrow.  The context for this order is the Huntington Beach application.  The language revisions are aimed at addressing concerns that at the end of the west-wide mitigation in the coming September, there would not be an effective replacement mitigation mechanism at CAISO.

We will have a short discussion on these items during the FERC call at 10 am today.  ABB

USA: UPDATE 1-FERC claims jurisdiction over Calif water dept.
  
11/20/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday said it has jurisdiction over California's main power purchasing arm, the California Department of Water Resources, which took over buying power for much of the state earlier this year. 
FERC also told the California Independent System Operator (ISO), which manages the power grid, to stop giving preferential treatment to the state water agency. 
As a power scheduling coordinator for PG&E Corp and Edison International's Southern California Edison, the water department must file with FERC a tariff schedule, FERC staffers said at a commission meeting. Those schedules are routinely required of other market players. 
The water department also should not be privy to market information unavailable to other market participants, the commission said. Such information sharing constitutes ""preferential treatment of the ISO towards the (state) water department, said FERC Commissioner William Massey. 
The California ISO manages the state's transmission grid and runs a complicated daily power auction to match buyers and sellers. FERC is currently auditing the ISO. 
The California Department of Water Resources became the state's only credit-worthy buyer earlier this year. The state stepped into the role after power shortages and impending price spikes barred direct purchases by the state's two largest utilities. 
Pacific Gas & Electric filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April and SoCal Edison's credit is rated junk status. 
Generators accused the California ISO of sharing sensitive market information with the water department and tilting its auction rules to favor long-term contracts inked in the wake of the power crisis. 
Power generators Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy Inc. have complained to FERC that information-sharing between the water department and the California ISO violates the California ISO's tariff.

"Details on the West-wide Price cap: now $108/MWh through April 30, 2002.","To the West Desk et al:

The FERC's west-wide price cap has been raised to at least $108/MWh beginning today through 30 April 02.  Please see the order excerpt below.  Although market prices are well below both the old and new cap, the new cap will give the markets more breathing room if there is an unexpected cold snap and/or supply disruption.

I am happy to report that the one of Enron's advocacy messages made it into the order: any change to the cap must be applied West-wide.  PNW parties and Duke were willing to settle with region-specific caps but FERC rejected that concept in favor of a single, West-wide value.

Alan Comnes

Relevant Passage:

""Effective on the trading day following the date of this order, through April 30, 2002, we will suspend the methodology used to calculate the current mitigated price and substitute the following West-wide winter season methodology. As a starting point, the
mitigated price will be set at $108/MWh. This is the actual mitigated price set using the current methodology during the last reserve deficiency on May 31, 2001, based on a gas index of $6.641/MMBtu, a generating unit with a heat rate of approximately 15,360 Btu/MWh and $6.00 for the O&M adder. The new interim mitigated price will supersede the existing mitigated price (approximately $92/MWh), which was set at eighty-five percent of the originally calculated $108/MWh mitigated price for application during non-reserve deficiency hours. We find this adjustment necessary to set the price for the winter period and to track changes in the gas indices.

The winter formula will maintain the current heat rate and O&M adder. The one variable in the formula will be tied to the current average of the mid-point for the monthly bid-week index prices reported for SoCal Gas (large packages), Malin and PG&E city-gate. Under the winter season formula, the mitigated price will be recalculated when the average gas price rises by a minimum factor of 10 percent (e.g., to $7.305/MMBtu) effective for the following trading day. The formula will also track subsequent
cumulative changes of at least 10 percent (including reductions of 10 percent, but not less than a floor of $108/Mwh). Effective on May 1, 2002, the summer methodology will be reinstated along with the current mitigated price of approximately $92/Mwh for non-emergency periods.""

Hi Everyone! 
I'm writing to tell you about an adventure I've committed to this fall! I've registered to participate in the Komen Portland Race for the Cure on September 16th. The Race benefits the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and supports the Komen Foundation's mission of eradicating breast cancer as a life-threatening disease by advancing research, education, screening and treatment.
Last year's Portland Race was the most successful ever - more than 40,000 women, men and children participated and helped raise more than $1.5 million for the fight against breast cancer! And while a number of strides have been made in breast cancer research and treatment, the fact remains that approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime. And although much less common, men also get breast cancer. That's why I'm racing for a cure.
The Race is especially important to me because my step-mother, Carol Cutsforth, died from complications associated with her breast cancer on January 14th, 2000. I am personally contributing to this cause, because I have seen first hand how this disease can cause a life time of suffering and sorrow for those who were close to breast cancer victims, and more than ever I want to help find a cure and help those who are in the fight for their life. 
You can join me in my fight against breast cancer without even breaking a sweat!
Would you please consider at least a $5 pledge to support my effort & The Komen Foundation?
My personal goal is to raise $1000.
Donations must be received by October 18th, 2001.
Your contribution is tax-deductible.
The tax number ID of the Oregon & SW Washington Affiliate of the Susan G. Koman Breast Canver Foundation is 93-1068897.
Receipts will be issued for contributions of $100 or more, or upon request.
Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this opportunity. Please contact me if you have any questions, want to learn more about the Komen Portland Race for the Cure, or if you'd like to join us on September 16th!
Thanks again!
Diane Cutsforth

Subject:	WSCC Reserve Standard

Tim,

After receiving Dick's message regarding the changes in the WSCC Reserve Standard, I went through the documents to try to understand the change being proposed.  I also made talked with some of the people who have been participants in the development of the new standard, to check on my understanding and ask a few follow-up questions.

While on its face, the reserve requirements are being lowered the standard is actually being tightened, because the new standard deals with the locations at which reserves are covered.  In the past, a party could carry all of its spin on a single unit.  The new standard is based on governor responses to frequency excursion.  It requires that the reserve be spread across more units or that special control features be added to AGC to allow carrying more reserves on some machines.  

As Dick indicated in his note, there is some potential for a reduction in system transfer capability.  For instance, carrying more reserves on NW hydro units in some hydrological conditions has the potential to reduce the Pacific Intertie rating by up to 20%.  However, given the limited reserves available in California, we are probably already in this condition.  With California at 1.5% reserve, there is a concern that the rating is already impacted.  On the other hand, when more generation comes on-line in California with new construction, then the reserve levels rise and the impact on transfer capability is mitigated.  

The other effect of this change is that it reduces the amount of Frequency Response Reserve (FRR) that California has to buy.  Whether the change in the responsibility to buy actually changes to pattern of reserves on machines cannot be determined at present.  However the change does have financial benefits to those who are chronically short of FRR.

Finally, I wondered how the shift to from individual control areas to a single control area with the formation of RTO West would affect the reserve requirements, since the new standard talks about carrying reserves by control area or reserve sharing pool.  I was reminded that the Northwest is a reserve sharing pool.  Since , the Northwest Power Pool and RTO West represent essentially the same portion of the system.  the RTO formation will not result in a major change in requirements.  

If you have additional questions, I will dig deeper.

Steve

Hello all!

At Julie's request, I followed up with Margaret Young, our parking coordinator with 2WTC parking. She informed me that Glen (the morning parking attendant) received your parking access cards this morning (Thursday morning) and that they should be available for you to pick up this afternoon.

If you have any further problems, please feel free to contact me directly and I will follow-up again.

Thanks for your patience!

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron.  

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addition to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepted positions with UBS Warburg:

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

"CAISO Notice - Market Design 2002","MARKET NOTICE
December 17, 2002
Market Design 2002
ISO Market Participants:
The ISO has begun a market design effort, ""Market Design 2002"" or ""MD02,""
that will culminate in several FERC filings over the next seven months or
so.  This effort will put in place changes to the California electricity
market beginning with the Real-time Market Pricing (""Target Price"") change,
continuing through the termination of the June 19, 2001 FERC market
mitigation measures on September 30, 2002 and completing the changes by
Summer, 2003.  This message will give you some background on the design
effort and identify a few of the upcoming project milestones.
Background
Since its start on March 31, 1998, the electricity market in California has
experienced many changes in market rules and operating procedures.  In
February, 2000, the ISO began a Congestion Management Reform (CMR) effort
spanning the next 12 months, which culminated in the January 2001 CMR
Proposal.  Although this effort produced a comprehensive approach to
resolving issues related to inter-zonal and intra-zonal congestion
management, forward and real time energy markets, local reliability and
several other issues, and reflected considerable Stakeholder input, it was
never filed with FERC for approval nor implemented.
The significant and unforeseen operational and financial events over the
past 12 months have changed the California electricity market substantially.
One of the most significant changes was the FERC Order of June 19, 2001 that
implemented price mitigation measures, not only in California but throughout
the West.  The price mitigation measures are scheduled to expire on
September 30, 2002.  Therefore, the ISO has initiated MD02 to complete the
market redesign process that began with the CMR project and to ensure that
upon expiration of the FERC-established price mitigation measures, there
will be adequate measures in place to maintain market/price stability and
reliable ISO operation. 
Milestones
The following are a few of the short-term key dates for the MD02 project:
December 21, 2001	ISO distributes draft MD02 Design Elements to
stakeholders for initial review.  This preliminary document will identify
the primary problems to be addressed and outline a proposal for addressing
them.  Although this will not be the primary document for soliciting
stakeholder comments, the ISO will receive any comments you may have on this
initial document.
January 4, 2002	ISO distributes MD02 Comprehensive Design Draft for
stakeholder review.  This document will include greater detail than the
December 21 Design Elements document and will be the focus of subsequent
discussions with market participants.
January 14-17, 2002	Focus Group meetings to discuss the MD02
Comprehensive Design Draft.  The format of these meetings will be similar to
that of the recent Focus Group meetings on uninstructed deviation pricing.
The targeted groups for these meetings are:
*	January 14:	Load-Serving Entities
*	January 15:	Generators and Marketers
*	January 16:	Municipal Utilities
*	January 17:	Other Control Areas
				We will send specific details of the
meetings by the end of this week.
January 23, 2002	Stakeholders' written comments on MD02 Comprehensive
Design Draft are due to the ISO.
February 1, 2002	MD02 Comprehensive Design distributed to ISO
Governing Board members and stakeholders
February 7, 2002	Present MD02 Comprehensive Design to ISO Governing
Board for approval.
Following the Board's decision on the MD02 Comprehensive Design on February
7, 2002, we will update you with a schedule for FERC filings and
implementation.
This is an aggressive schedule for an ambitious undertaking.  However, it is
imperative that the ISO address basic design flaws of the market and make
major changes where necessary prior to the expiration of the
FERC-established price mitigation measures.  We also believe this schedule
is necessary to put the ISO in a position to implement a comprehensive
redesign that will occur in several phases beginning with the summer of 2002
and continuing through Spring 2003.  
We look forward to working with you to develop this proposal.  If you have
questions or would like additional information, please contact Byron Woertz
at bwoertz@caiso.com <mailto:jdoe@caiso.com>  or (916) 608-7066.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"CERS Update","Market Notice
October 29, 2001

Market Participants:

  The ISO has been notified that effective HE0800 (beginning at 0700)
October 30, 2001, CERS will no longer provide creditworthy backing of
negative decremental energy bids and negative OOM sales (i.e. any bids below
zero dollars). If for reliability purposes, the ISO needs a negative
decremental energy bid, CERS has indicated to the ISO that it may back such
bids on a case-by-case basis at its sole discretion.  Accordingly, in
continuing compliance with FERC's orders, the ISO will not dispatch any
negative decremental energy bids or any negative OOM sales absent assurances
of creditworthy backing.  

  Please contact your Client Representative with any questions.

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"September 11th Fund Confirmation","Dear Phil Platter,

Thank you for your gift of $100.00 to The September 11th Fund.  The Fund was established by United Way of New York City and The New York Community Trust to respond to the immediate and longer-term needs of victims, their families, and communities affected by the tragic events of September 11, 2001.

Within 11 days of the attacks, checks were being written to victims and their families by experienced relief agencies using cash grants from The September 11th Fund.  Right now, your contribution is helping to provide emergency cash assistance, legal counseling, grief therapy, job training and placement, and other vital services for victims, families and others directly affected. Your gift is helping people and communities rebuild their lives.  

On behalf of Joshua Gotbaum, chief executive officer of The September 11th Fund, we invite you to visit http://www.september11fund.org for up-to-date information and to sign up for e-mail updates on how your contribution to The September 11th Fund is helping to fund recovery efforts.

If your employer has a matching gift program for The September 11th Fund and requires verification of your gift, this e-mail will serve as that verification.  Please contact your company's human resource or community affairs department if you have any questions. 

Again, thank you for your continued support of The September 11th Fund and of community foundations and United Ways across the country.

Sincerely,


Ralph Dickerson, Jr.
President
United Way of New York City

As with all of the estate accounts, just add an est_ prefix to the id to get the estate id.  The initial password for all the accounts is s3cur34u!

Good Morning Corry,

Based on my most current information, it looks like all the UBS employees will have their user ID's switched to the new security groups next Wednesday or Thursday, February 6th or 7th.  When that occurs, your NT logon (ex. cbentle) will connect to UBS's version of the O:, M:, W:, R: drives as well as UBS's version of Enpower, Portcalc, etc.  If there are any Power schedulers on your team that need access to the Enron Estate versions of these devices, please let me know their names & NT logons.  We will then create duplicate accounts using an ""est_"" prefix.  Example: cbentle will log you into the UBS devices.  est_cbentle will log you into the Enron estate devices.

Thanks,  David Poston

"RE: Good News! Enron Has Reached a Definitive Agreement with Dynergy","Here is the Q&A on the agreement and the press release.

 
Merger Q&A
Nov. 9, 2001 
THE DEAL
What are the deal terms?
The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange. 
The exchange ratio will be 0.2685. As an example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 269 shares of the combined company upon closing. 
Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. 
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately, and an additional $1 billion upon closing of the merger. 
Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock. 
Enron will have immediate access to the $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.
What approvals are required?
This merger will require SEC and FERC approvals, the approval of shareholders of both Enron and Dynegy, and expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period. In addition, various approvals are required due to the ownership of Enron's and Dynegy's wholly owned subsidiaries.
From a business standpoint, are Enron and Dynegy now one company?
Not until closing, which may not occur for a number of months. Until that time we will continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have done in the past. In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc. We will act towards Dynegy the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.
When do you expect the deal to close?
The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q3 2002.
Why do you believe this is the best deal for shareholders?
The Board considered numerous options-stand-alone execution, private equity infusions, strategic partner infusion and a merger with a strategic partner. The Enron Board felt that the merger with Dynegy, coupled with the $1.5 billion equity investment, was the best opportunity for continued growth and shareholder value.
What is the ownership structure of the new company? 
On a converted basis, Enron shareholders will own approximately 36% of the new company, and Dynegy shareholders will own 64%. Post closing, the combined company is expected to have approximately 700 million shares outstanding.
What percentage of shareholder votes is required to approve the transaction? 
A majority of Enron shareholders must approve the transaction, and 2/3 of Dynegy shareholders must approve.
Has a new management team been identified?
Chuck Watson - Chairman and CEO
Steve Bergstrom - President and COO
Greg Whalley - Executive Vice President
Robert Doty - CFO
Watson, Bergstrom and Whalley will make up the combined company's Office of the Chairman.
Has Dynegy completed due diligence? Are they satisfied that the potential exposure is manageable?
Dynegy has completed significant due diligence and there is no due diligence out as such. Dynegy was fully aware of the matters reported recently with respect to certain financial statement restatements and related party transactions.
How will the Board seats be allocated?
When the merger is complete, the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of no more than 15 members. Dynegy's designees will include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.
How will the merger impact customers?
We expect customers to benefit significantly from this combination. This combination provides a wider and more diverse platform to meet the energy needs of our customers with reliable delivery and predictable pricing. Customers will also benefit from broader supply-sources of the two companies.
Does this mean Northern Natural Gas is no longer a part of Enron?
No. Northern Natural Gas will remain an important member of the Enron family. If the merger is terminated Dynegy has a right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, subject to a repurchase right of Enron.
Is Dynegy buying Northern Natural Gas?
No, Dynegy is buying a $1.5 billion preferred stock interest in Northern Natural Gas and acquiring an option to acquire 100% of Northern Natural Gas in certain circumstances if the merger is terminated.
What percent of Northern Natural Gas will Dynegy own?
They will own preferred stock unless and until the merger is terminated and Dynegy exercises its right under certain circumstances to purchase 100% of Northern Natural Gas.
FINANCIAL ISSUES
Why is Enron merging at this price?
Enron's Board of Directors and management considered numerous options to best serve the interest of our shareholders, including: 
Stand-alone execution. 
Private equity infusion. 
Strategic partner infusion. 
A merger with a strategic partner.
The Board and management feel strongly that a merger with Dynegy, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion in cash, offered the best opportunity for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value. 
Have you discussed the combination with the rating agencies?
Yes. The preliminary assessment by the rating agencies has been positive.
ENRON QUESTIONS
What are the immediate business benefits of the transaction?
This deal confirms the value of Enron's core business and strengthens the company's liquidity. This transaction enables the shareholders of both companies to participate in the upside of the combined enterprise.
What will happen to Enron Online?
It will continue as EnronOnline until the transaction closes.
How will you treat proprietary trading information prior to the deal close? What impact will this have on counterparty trading?
Until the deal closes they remain separate companies and will keep confidential trading information confidential.
What will happen to Enron's pending asset sales?
The asset sales we have previously announced are scheduled to move forward.
What happens to the SEC investigation?
As we have from the beginning, Enron will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC investigation.
What happens to the lines of credit Enron took out last week?
Enron drew down on $3 billion from existing credit lines and has obtained commitment letters on an additional $1 billion secured financing.
Will any Enron executives have a role in the combined company's senior management team?
Yes, Greg Whalley will serve as Executive Vice President and will join Dynegy's Office of the Chairman when the transaction closes.
What happens to Ken Lay?
Ken Lay will remain as Chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. He will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.
Will Enron complete its new building?
Yes.
Is Enron's vision still to be the world's leading company?
Enron's vision will be revisited once the companies are merged.
Will this affect Enron's innovation?
A key strength of Enron and Dynegy has been their employees' innovation and we expect this to continue.
What will this do to our deregulation efforts?
Both Enron and Dynegy share the belief in open markets and competition. We believe our deregulation efforts will continue.
DYNEGY ISSUES
Dynegy profile:
Dynegy Inc. is a leading energy merchant and power generator in North America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. A Fortune 100 company, Dynegy in 2000 established its communications business, Dynegy Global Communications, which is engaged in providing network solutions and connectivity to wholesale customers worldwide..
What is ChevronTexaco's relationship to this deal?
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion at the closing of the merger.
COMBINED
What will the new company's name be?
The combined company will retain Dynegy's name.
Who will be the CEO of the new company?
Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy Inc. will become the Chairman and CEO of the new entity.
Who will be president?
Steve Bergstrom, president and COO of Dynegy Inc. will become the President and COO of the new entity.
Will there be an integration team? Who will be on it?
The integration process will be focused on designing a strong and efficient organization. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient transition. Details of the make-up of the team have not yet been determined.
Will the companies merge offices and where?
There are currently no plans to merge offices. Considering the size of a combined organization, however, office spaces will be evaluated at a later date.
COMMUNITY ISSUES
Will Enron Field be renamed?
The combined company will determine this.
Is Enron's contribution program continuing during this time?
The contributions program will still be a focus for Enron, but we have curtailed new giving for now.
What does this merger mean for Houston?
We believe that it is positive for Houston because two premier energy companies will join forces and remain in the city.
EMPLOYMENT ISSUES
Will Enron (or Dynegy) employees be laid off as a result of the merger?
The merger will be a long and complex process. Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger, and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company.
How many lay offs will there be?
Prior to the merger, we hope to address any need for employment reductions through attrition and reduced hirings. We cannot rule out involuntary separations, but we have not targeted a specific number at this time.
If I am laid off, either prior to the merger completion (or as a result of it), what will my severance package be? Will the severance plan change?
If an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern. Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts. No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.
What happens to our bonuses this year?
The 2001 bonus process will continue as usual and will be consistent with previous practice based on company and individual performance.
What will happen to my stock options?
Your vested unexercised and unvested options will be converted as follows:
The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted. Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close. At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.
Will there be salary adjustments as a result of the merger?
Both companies will continue our market-based approach to compensating employees. In addition, both companies have a strong pay for performance philosophy in regard to total cash compensation. Prior to the merger, there will be no changes in Enron's salary structure. Post merger, we will jointly determine our salary strategy and structure.
What will happen with benefits and retirement programs?
There are no anticipated changes to Enron benefit plans before the merger is completed. Upon completion of the merger we anticipate that there will likely be changes to ensure that one benefits strategy exists for the merged company.
Will the analyst and associate program at Enron continue?
As we bring both companies together, we will look into the possibility of combining both Dynegy's PACE program with Enron's Associate/Analyst program.
Where do I go if I have a question?
A detailed general Q & A on the merger is being prepared at present and will be posted on the Enron Update intranet page. Additionally, Enron and Dynegy HR teams are jointly preparing a detailed employee Q & A to address HR-related questions. This will be posted on the same website as the general Q & A. In the interim, if you have a specific question or concern you may email questions@enron.com. 
INTERNAL ISSUES
What will happen to non-Houston locations?
Decisions will be made about all locations in the coming weeks.
Will moves to the new building continue as planned?
Yes, at this time.
When will we begin seeing changes in our workplace?
Until the merger is completed it is unlikely you will see many changes in the workplace. As things change, we will share this information with you.
Will there be a year-end PRC?
We are still reviewing the year-end process.
Does Dynegy have a performance review process like Enron?
Dynegy has a similar performance review to Enron's.
Will there still be a Chairman's Award?
Yes.
Will any early retirement packages be offered?
There are no plans to offer such packages at this time.
Is there a hiring freeze? Will all open positions at Enron just remain open or be cancelled?
We are carefully evaluating every open position and only staffing those that are critical to the business.
INTERNAL - COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Will the VIP program continue?
We are currently evaluating this program.
Will the matching gifts program continue?
We are currently evaluating this program.
What happens to the Enron childcare center?
It will continue its current operations. We will re-evaluate operations after the merger.
What happens to ClickatHome?
We are currently evaluating this program.
If employees are laid off, will they be required to pay for their computers from the ClickatHome program?
Enron's current policy will remain in effect which states that individuals who leave as a consequence of involuntary termination are not required to pay back the cost of the computer, however, they are required to pay the taxes as stated on heir W2 form.
Will the Enron Body Shop remain open?
The Body Shop will remain open and continue with normal hours. Once the merger is nearing completion the program will be evaluated.
What does this mean for the United Way?
Both Enron and Dynegy are supporters of the United Way. The merged entity will also continue to support the UW. The company will match all employee contributions to the United Way as promised.

"Enron's Financial Security in the ISO's Markets","ISO Market Participants:
MARKET NOTICE
December 3, 2001
Enron's Financial Security in the ISO's Markets
ISO Market Participants:
In response to inquires from ISO Market Participants, including suppliers
and Scheduling Coordinators, the ISO confirms that Enron is not in default
of any obligations due the markets as of this date.  Further, the ISO has
requested and has received from Enron cash security in an amount estimated
by the ISO to be sufficient to meet Enron's load requirements in real time
for a period of three days, in the event that Enron defaults entirely on its
market obligations.  The security amount is based on Enron's average daily
metered demand in recent weeks, the current average market clearing price,
ancillary service charges and grid management charges.  The ISO will monitor
Enron's transactions on a daily basis and will require additional security
if needed. 
If you have questions, please contact Keoni Almeida at kalmeida@caiso.com
<mailto:kalmeida@caiso.com> or (916) 608-7053.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Subject:        Big News! 

Dear Friends! 

I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas holiday...it went by fast and 
it's always a crazy time.  The kids had a blast with all of their new 
gifts and gadgets that required frequent battery installation so the 
house has been busy...and noisy.  (what kind of relative would buy the 
noisiest toys in the store?!) 

The best part of our holiday is that I became engaged on Christmas Eve. 
It was a wonderfully planned proposal and I received a beautiful 
engagement ring. The fellows' name is Brad Bailor and he is a wonderful 
man .  We are very happy and plan a wedding sometime in July. 

I just couldn't wait to share our news! 

I hope all is well with all of you and Happy New Year! 

Love, Lisa

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

"Harborside Restaurant - Portland, OR","Dude....remember the beer cheese soup?
 
Well, as you know, the wife is due with our 2nd child in May.  Well, she had a craving today for beer cheese soup --just like the stuff @ Harborside restaurant.  
 
The weather here in Houston was really like Portland....mid-40s/lower 50s, constant rain.
 
Anyway, I searched the 'net for the recipe--there are several different recipes, but I wanted the Harborside recipe.  When I couldn't find it, I just called the restaurant direct.   
 
I spoke with the chef and he was extraordinarily kind--he not only put a copy of the recipe in the mail to us, he took the time to go over the recipe with Jane Ann over the phone so we could cook it tonight.
 
Anyway, I thought you mind find this slightly interesting!!

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"Employee Assistance Program - Workshops Scheduled","
Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm

Subject:	City of Azusa

Steve & Christian,

After talking with the Southwest desk here is what is happening with Azusa.

 Deal #831407.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Purchase from Azusa at $32.50  1/1/02 thru 3/31/02
 Deal #537901.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Sale to Azusa at $139.00         1/1/02 thru 12/31/02

	These two deals are the only ones active for January  and are being performed on.  They are booked out financially. All other deals I found are for Q3 '02 and beyond.  

I hope this clarifies some things.

	        In order that we may capture all possible electronic information related to the litigation, please do the following:

	        1.      If you have any voice mails that relate in any way to the LJM Deal or Chewco Investments L.P., including any accounting issues related to these transactions, please forward the voice mails to  x3-6800.

	        2.      If you have any voice mails that relate in any way to Enron's public statements regarding EBS, Azurix, New Power Co., or any voice mail regarding financial transactions involving these matters, including accounting issues related to these matters, please forward the voice mails to  x3-6801.

	        3.      If you have any e-mails that relate in any way to the LJM Deal or Chewco Investments L.P., including any accounting issues related to these transactions, please forward the e-mails to  LJM.Litigation@enron.com.

	        Over the next month, our lawyers will be collecting our traditional files, i.e., written documents, for possible production in litigation.  In the meantime, please retain all of your hard-copy files that in any way relate to:

	        1.      The LJM Deal

Are you having to work as long and as hard as when I left?  When are you coming to visit?   Right now we live next to a really nice and large green area where cricket is played on the weekends and next to the Royal Botanical Gardens.  There are several pubs bordering the green and they don't seem to mind you taking your pints across the street and drinking them on the green as long as you bring them back.  The weather has finally become really nice, much like Portland does about a month earlier.  We are getting settled in and used to the peculiar way of life here.  People seem to put up with alot of crap here and are really good about sort of enduring everything.

We went o a Texas Exes BRBQ a couple of weeks ago. It was sort of fun but I guess I do not miss Texas enough yet to really care much.  I do miss Portland though.  Portland is a very easy city to miss because for the most part everything is so easy to deal with there.  little or no traffic, grocery stores open all night, you can bike around, it is very inexpensive compared to London.  Which reminds me....you would shit if you saw how expensive things are in London.  

Al is doing great know that he is quiting Enron.  Yes that is right but do not tell anyone yet his last day is June 30th.   When I found out about it I felt really bad and sort of pissed off.  Oh well Enron's loss.  He shouldn't have a problem at all getting a job. Speaking of which Rusty with Aquila is over here now as is Diem and Harvey and John Wartez with Williams.  Such a small world.  I told Al that he couldn't hang with working near me for more than 3 months because I was taking away the spotlight :-)  Oh well...there is something else that will probably piss you off..I am writing this letter from the Madrid office.  I am down here doing some work since I am focusing on the Spanish market right now.  Everything here is going great.  I really enjoy working with Paul and the group that they have here.  You will definitely have to visit in the summer.  Good luck with everthing, take care and don't sweat the small stuff.

Cheers,

Kristian

If Santa answered his mail honestly...

Dear Santa I wud like a kool toy space ranjur fer Xmas. Iv ben a gud
boy all yeer.
Yer Frend, BiLLy

Dear Billy, Nice spelling. You're on your way to a career in lawn
care. How about I send you a f....... book so you can learn to read and
write?
I'm giving your older brother the space ranger. At least HE can spell!
Santa


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I
ask for is peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love, Sarah

Dear Sarah, Your parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
Santa


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas,
I'd like for my mommy and daddy to get back together. Please see what
you can do.
Love,Teddy

Dear Teddy, Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen
door in a hurricane. Do you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give up
that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead. Santa

----------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I.
Joes, a dog, a drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love, Francis

Dear Francis, Who names their kid ""Francis"" nowadays? I bet
you're retarded. Santa

----------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I
left carrots for your reindeer outside the back door.
Love, Susan

Dear Susan, Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart
in my face when riding in the sleigh. You want to do me a favour? Leave
me a bottle of scotch. Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, What do you do the other 364 days of the year? Are
you busy making toys? Your friend, Thomas

Dear Thomas, All the toys are made in China. I have a condo in Vegas,
where I spend most of my time making low-budget porno films. I unwind
by drinking myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail
waitresses while losing money at the craps table. Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know
when we're awake, like in the song?
Love, Jessica

Dear Jessica, Are you really that gullible? Good luck in whatever
you do. I'm skipping your house. Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Santa, I really really want a puppy this year. Please please
please PLEASE PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Timmy, That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but
that crap doesn't work with me. You're getting a sweater again. Santa

-------------------------------------------------------------
Dearest Santa, We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you
get into our home? Love, Marky

Mark, First, stop calling yourself ""Marky"", that's why you're
getting your ass whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house,
you live in a low-rent apartment complex. Third, I get inside your pad
just like all the burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet Dreams, Santa

Subject:	Hanson and Pilot Annuities

All,

I've entered an annuity for October and November Pilot Power scheduling fee, for the November Hanson Cement scheduling fee, and the book-to-book transfer between West Services and Short Term California to split the scheduling fee.  Currently, the fee for Pilot Power is $7,500 per month ($2,500 per load zone scheduled, SCE1, SDG1, and PGE3), and the scheduling fee for Hanson is $2,500.  The Enpower deal #'s are 855213, 855309, and 855318.

Please take a few moments to review these annuities.  Going forward, West Services will enter these annuities at the first of every month for the month ahead.

"Enron Updates","
Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

New Enron Employee Q&A

A new Q&A has been posted to <http://home.enron.com/updates/> based on recent developments and employee concerns.

"FW: IEP FERC/ISO: FERC Mtg Agenda for 12/19","In addition to the summary below, the agenda has the West-wide cap case on the agenda.


FERC has posted its agenda.  It is available at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\MISC\CA\CA121901.000.TXT.

Here comes the Federal Regulatory Santa Claus?  FERC's agenda for its 12/19
meeting is incredibly ambitious and appears to have queued up a large swath
of high profile cases.  To speculate based upon the current, end-of-the-year
agenda, it appears that there will be orders regarding RTOs at center stage,
with a twist of congestion mitigation thrown in (?).  Interconnection issues
also come up, including the CA dockets.  There's also an order coming in the
California docket, but its not that clear whether this addresses the gross
load issue, outage coordination, the must-offer requirement, or some other
facet of the ""market mitigation"" docket.  RMR contract updates and the
various protests also come up for consideration.

Important Information for CFP? Program Students
Considering a Master's Degree
As you may know, the CFP? Professional Education Program is also the foundation for the Master of Science Degree (in the Financial Planning Specialization) from the College for Financial Planning. The courses CFP1101 through CFP1105 receive master's-level credit when you enroll in the master's program, for a total of 15 of the required 36 credit hours (41%). This accreditation is about to change.

Now is the time to enroll in the College's master's program to receive full credit for all of your CFP? courses. You must enroll in the program before December 31, 2001, in order for all of your credits to be transferable. Keep in mind that the enrollment process can take a few weeks, so don't wait until the last minute.

Even if you are just beginning your CFP? course work, you may still enroll in the master's program and receive full credit for all courses, but you must enroll prior to the deadline. 

To enroll in the master's program, or for more information, call an Enrollment Advisor at 1-800-237-9990 (option 3), or visit the College's Web site <http://www.fp.edu/adclick.asp?ciid=32>.

 

CFP?, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER?, and CFP (with flame logo)
 are certification marks owned by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. The College for Financial Planning does not certify individuals to use the CFP?, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER? or CFP (with flame logo)
 certification marks. CFP certification is granted only by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards to those persons who, in addition to completing an education requirement such as this CFP Board-Registered Program, have met its ethics, experience, and examination requirements.

Subject:         
Importance:     High 
Sensitivity:    Confidential 
This was just forwarded to me by my mom.  You definitely only want to read 
this one during some quiet time... 
17-year-old Brian Moore had only a short time to write something for the 
Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting. 
It was his turn to lead the discussion so he sat down and wrote. 
He showed the essay, titled ""The Room"" to his mother, Beth, 
before he headed out the door. 
""I wowed 'em."" he later told his father, Bruce. 
""It's a killer, It's the bomb. It's the best thing I ever wrote."" 
It also was the last. 
Brian's parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while 
cleaning out the teenager's locker at Teary Valley High School. 
Brian had been dead only hours, but his parents desperately wanted every 
piece of his life near them -- the crepe paper that had adorned his locker 
during his senior football season, notes from classmates and teachers, his 
homework. 
Only two months before, he had handwritten the essay about encountering 
Jesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teen's 
life. 
But it was only after Brian's death that Beth and Bruce Moore realized 
that their son had described his view of heaven. 
""It makes such an impact that people want to share it. You feel like you 
 are there."" Mr. Moore said. 
Brian Moore died May 27, 1997, -- the day after Memorial Day. 
 He was driving home from a friend's house when his car went off 
Bulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole. He emerged 
from the wreck unharmed but 
stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted. 
Brian seemed to excel at everything he did. He was an honor student. He told 
his parents he loved them ""a hundred times a day"", Mrs. Moore said. He was a 
star wide receiver for the Teary's Valley 
Football team and had earned a four-year scholarship to Capital University 
in Columbus because of his athletic and academic abilities. He took it upon 
himself to learn how to help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at 
school. 
During one homecoming ceremony, Brian walked on his tiptoes so that the girl 
he was escorting wouldn't be embarrassed about being taller than him. 
He adored his kid brother, Bruce, now 14. 
He often escorted his grandmother, Evelyn Moore, who lives in Columbus, to 
church. 
""I always called him the ""deep thinker"", Evelyn said of her eldest grandson. 
Two years after his death, his family still struggles to understand why 
Brian was taken from them. 
They find comfort at the cemetery where Brian is buried, just a few blocks 
from their home. They visit daily. A candle and dozens of silk and real 
flowers keep vigil over the gravesite. 
The Moore's framed a copy of Brian's essay and hung it among the family 
portraits in the living room. 
""I think God used him to make a point. I think we were meant to find it and 
make something out of it,"" Mrs. Moore said of the essay. 
She and her husband want to share their son's vision of life after death. 
""I'm happy for Brian. I know he's in heaven. I know I'll see him again 
someday."" Mrs. Moore said. 
""It just hurts so bad now."" 
 The Room... 
 In that place between wakefulness and dreams, I found myself in the room. 
There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with 
small index card files. They were like the ones in libraries that list 
titles by author or subject in alphabetical order. But these files, which 
stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction, 
had very different headings. 
As I drew near the wall of files, the first to catch my attention was one 
that read ""Girls I have liked."" 
I opened it and began flipping through the cards. 
I quickly shut it, shocked to realize that I recognized the names written 
on each one. 
And then without being told, I knew exactly where I was. 
This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my 
life. 
 Here were written the actions of my every moment, big and small, 
in a detail my memory couldn't match. 
A sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror, stirred 
within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content. 
Some brought joy and sweet memories; others a sense of shame and regret so 
intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching. 
A file named ""Friends"" 
was next to one marked 
""Friends I have betrayed."" 
The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird. 
""Books I Have Read,"" 
""Lies I Have Told,"" 
""Comfort I have Given,"" 
""Jokes I Have Laughed at."" 
Some were almost hilarious in their exactness: 
""Things I've yelled at my brothers."" 
Others I couldn't laugh at: 
""Things I Have Done in My Anger"" 
""Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents."" 
I never ceased to be surprised by the contents. 
Often there were many more cards than I expected. 
Sometimes fewer than I hoped. 
I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived. 
Could it be possible that I had the time 
in my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards? 
But each card confirmed this truth. 
Each was written in my own handwriting. 
Each signed with my signature. 
When I pulled out the file marked 
""Songs I have listened to,"" 
I realized the files grew to 
contain their contents. 
The cards were packed tightly, 
and yet after two or three yards, 
I hadn't found the end of the file. 
I shut it, shamed, not so much by the quality of music 
but more by the vast time I knew that file represented. 
When I came to a file marked 
""Lustful Thoughts,"" 
I felt a chill run through my body. 
I pulled the file out only an inch, 
not willing to test its size, 
and drew out a card. 
I shuddered at its detailed content. 
I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded. 
An almost animal rage broke on me. 
One thought dominated my mind: 
""No one must ever see these cards! 
No one must ever see this room! 
I have to destroy them!"" 
In insane frenzy I yanked the file out. 
Its size didn't matter now. 
I had to empty it and burn the cards. 
But as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor, 
I could not dislodge a single card. 
I became desperate and pulled out a card, 
only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it. 
Defeated and utterly helpless, I returned the file to its slot. 
Leaning my forehead against the wall, 
I let out a long, self-pitying sigh. 
And then I saw it. 
The title bore ""People I Have Shared the Gospel With."" 
The handle was brighter than those around it, 
newer, almost unused. 
I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches 
long fell into my hands. 
I could count the cards it contained on one hand. 
And then the tears came. 
I began to weep. 
Sobs so deep that they hurt. 
They started in my stomach and shook through me. 
I fell on my knees and cried. I cried out of shame, 
from the overwhelming shame of it all. 
The rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes. 
No one must ever, ever know of this room. 
I must lock it up and hide the key. 
But then as I pushed away the tears, 
I saw Him. 
No, please not Him. 
Not here. 
Oh, anyone but Jesus. 
I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards. 
I couldn't bear to watch His response. 
And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face, 
I saw a sorrow deeper than my own. 
He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes. 
Why did He have to read every one? 
Finally He turned and 
looked at me from across the room. 
He looked at me with pity in His eyes. 
But this was a pity that didn't anger me. 
I dropped my head, 
covered my face with my hands and began to cry again. 
He walked over and put His arm around me. 
He could have said so many things. 
But He didn't say a word. He just cried with me. 
Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files. 
Starting at one end of the room, He took out a file and, 
one by one, began to sign 
His name over mine on each card. 
""No!"" 
 I shouted rushing to Him. 
All I could find to say was 
""No, no, "" 
as I pulled the card from Him. 
His name shouldn't be on these cards. 
But there it was, 
written in red so rich, 
so dark, 
so alive. 
The name of Jesus covered mine. 
It was written with His blood. 
He gently took the card back. 
He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards. 
I don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, 
but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk 
 back to my side. 
He placed His hand on my shoulder and said, 
""It is finished."" 
I stood up, and He led me out of the room. 
There was no lock on its door. 
There were still cards to be written. 
""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."" ---Phil. 4:13 
""For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, 
that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."" 
If you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you 
can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also. 
My ""People I shared the gospel with"" file just got bigger, 
how about yours?

Road #2 Newberg OR 97132.  If you have questions, you can contact her at
lamartin59@aol.com.  We must have your check prior to February 10th. 

In other upcoming events, the Oregonians for Nebraska 3rd Annual Founders 
Day celebration is scheduled for Saturday, March 9th.   The festivities
will kickoff with an exclusive social hour for Blackshirt Club members
only from 6 to 6:30 pm.  A social hour with a no host bar including a
silent auction for all others will start at 6:30 with dinner served at
7:30 pm.  Throughout the evening, there will be door prizes and an
exclusive raffle for those attending who are Alumni Association members.  

The event is taking place at McMenamins Edgefield Manor in Troutdale.
Edgefield is a unique 
European-style village, which includes lodging, a pub with a movie
theater, fine dining, a winery, a brewery, distillery, golf course,
gardens, vineyards, artwork, meeting, wedding and banquet space, and
special events year round. Edgefield, built in 1911, served for several
decades as the Multnomah County Poor Farm. Residents operated a
self-sufficient environment, raising hogs, poultry, growing a variety of
fruits and vegetables, operating a dairy, cannery and meat packing plant
as well as working in the laundry, kitchen and hospital.  In 1947, it was 
renamed the Multnomah County Home and Farm and in the late fifties the
farm operation was eliminated. In 1962, the facitity was renamed
Edgefield Manor and for the last two decades of operation, functioned as
a nursing home and eventually closed in 1982. McMenamins purchased the
property from Multnomah County in 1990. In phases lasting over four
years, the condemned buildings and land were transformed into a place
that is quite special.  

Edgefield also offers over 100 bed and breakfast rooms creating a unique
lodging experience.   Spacious rooms are furnished with cozy and inviting 
decor from the turn of the century. Televisions and telephones are absent 
from the rooms, encouraging a tranquil retreat atmosphere.  If you are
interested in spending the night on the 9th, contact Edgefield directly
at 503-669-8610.  Be sure to mention that you are with the Oregonians for 
Nebraska for discounted room rates.  

Our speakers this year include the dean of the Nebraska football coaching 
staff, George Darlington and Chancellor of the University Harvey Perlman. 
Coach Darlington is the only remaining member of Tom Osborne's original
Husker staff.  Darlington is just finished his 29th season with the
Huskers and his 16th as Nebraska's secondary coach. Darlington originally 
tutored the defensive ends for 13 seasons.  Chancellor Perlman took over
the reins of the University in 2000.  Come hear about the future of both
the University and the football team!  

The theme of this year's Founders Day is The Road to Number One.  The

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"FERC ACTION!","I attended the FERC Commission meeting this morning and it was short and refreshing.  Here are some high points:

FERC issues an order rejecting the proposed amendment to the CAISO creditworthiness provisions, and granting in part the complaint of the generators in the docket (which we supported).  The CAISO is ordered to enforce the existing creditworthiness provisions of its tariff and invoice CDWR for transactions with the non-creditworthy IOUs, within 15 days.  Otherwise, FERC will seek injunctive relief in court to enforce its order.  Also, a creditworthy party must be provided and bills paid, otherwise, the must offer requirement will be suspended (applies to California).  Commissioner Massey dissented on the suspension of the must offer requirement.  Wood indicated that he supported the order as written and quipped that ""the ISO must now do what we told them to do the 3rd time!""  The remaining Commissioners voted in favor.

Unanimous vote on a 6-page order which establishes the FERC ""business plan"" on how it will move forward on RTO's, electricity market design and structure, so that faster progress can be made.

Watch for a future order relaxing the FERC's ex parte rules to facilitate communication between FERC and state commissioners.  The idea is that communications will be more freely made and that a transcript of the communication will be filed in the record of the proceeding to comply with due process and other legal requirements.

I gathered the above from the discussions held at the meeting as the draft orders are not yet available.  We will review them upon receipt, and update this e-mail if necessary.

"Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?","Wednesday February 6, 1:41 pm Eastern Time 
BusinessWeek Online
DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS 
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas 
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. 
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. 
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. 
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. 
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. 
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. 
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. 
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' 
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' 
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

"FW: Resume' - Phillip Platter - Enron Power Marketing","

-----Original Message-----
From: Platter [mailto:platter.oregon@verizon.net]
Sent: Thursday, December 13, 2001 8:42 PM
To: lkapustka@oppd.com
Subject: Resume' - Phillip Platter - Enron Power Marketing


Dear Ms. Kapustka,

Last year I believe you had a conversation with my sister Molly Elvig about
any opportunities for me at OPPD.  I got in touch with Dave Dietz ( it may
have been Dave Ried) at that time and it was apparent then that there
weren't opportunities available. Since then, I have expanded on my
experience in the power industry with Enron in Portland, Oregon.

As you may know, Enron has filed for bankruptcy which has resulted in very
uncertain times for many Enron employees including myself.  While I am still
employed in Enron's trading operations and believe we will be back trading
as soon as we find a buyer, I have decided to seek other opportunities.

I believe my experience at Enron, especially in power trading and
scheduling, would provide me with a great foundation for success at OPPD.

The past 11 months I have been trading next day power in the California
market.  My primary responsibilities included making markets on EnronOnline
for off peak and odd-lot power.  My average daily trading volume for these
products ranged from 60 to 90 trades per day.  I also had responsibility for
managing the scheduling function which had been my main focus for the prior
3  years. Much of my time has been spent analyzing the market fundamentals
including plant outages, transmission constraints, gas prices, weather, and
Hydro flows.

Over the last 4 years in power marketing I have been involved in scheduling
all trading hubs in the WSCC, including extensive experience with the
California ISO. I also worked shifts in the real time group.  I also am a
C.P.A. with experience in budgeting and earnings analysis with Northern
Natural Gas Company, an Enron subsidiary.

I am primarily interested in opportunities you may have in energy marketing
and trading, but would consider other areas in your company. I have attached
my resume' for your review and want to inform you I will be in Nebraska from
December 26th thru January 3rd.  I realize the Holidays are a busy time, but
if you feel it may be beneficial to meet, I would gladly arrange to be
available. I can be reached at 503-624-7995 (home),503-464-3934(work), or
503-701-9736(cell). I have also sent this information to David Ried and Dave
Kulisek.

I look forward to hearing from you soon and I appreciate any assistance or
advice you may provide me.

Sincerely,


Phillip Platter

Subject: New Company SC Application


Scott, I spoke with our Director and he agreed that I should be on point to
process the SC application for the new company and I will be assigned as the
Account Manager. Below is a list of requirements and the process for
certifying a new SC:

	Scheduling Coordinator Process Overview -
http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/09/08/09003a60800908c3.doc

	SC Application (SCAP Appendix A) - Please submit a completed
application form and $500 application fee to initiate SC certification
process to:
California Independent System Operator Corporation
c/o Scheduling Coordinator Application Processing Office
151 Blue Ravine Road
Folsom CA  95630

	The following is a list of SC requirements and associated links to
the CAISO website, specific information to each requirement.
	 Scheduling Coordinator Agreement - The Proforma agreement is
available on the CAISO web at:
http://www.caiso.com/docs/1999/01/13/199901131348367370.rtf.  
	Meter Service Agreement for SC Metered Entities - The Proforma
agreement can be reviewed on the CAISO web at:
http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/03/e3/09003a608003e3ab.pdf.  
	ISO ECN Connectivity -CAISO Telecommunication will coordinate the
interconnection of the SC's Scheduling and  Metering Systems with ISO Energy
communication Network (ECN) an the Meter Data Acquisition System (MDAS).
Please see our Communications Subscribers Service Guide at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/1999/01/15/1999011506410028191.pdf. 
	 
	Attached are the information sheets for the Scheduling Coordinator
Agreement (SCA), and Meter Service Agreement for SC Metered Entities
(MSA-SC) that you will need to fill out.  The CAISO's Contracts group  uses
these information sheets to complete three original agreements for your
signature.

Here is the checklist that will need to be completed prior to the new
company being certified:

"UBS Wins","John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner.  As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...

"Update on Credit Card Use and Company Expenses","Our Director of Corporate Travel has informed us that American Express will not be able to establish a new Corporate account for us at this time.  

Until we are able to obtain company-sponsored credit cards, when incurring company expenses it will be necessary to use personal credit cards or cash, which can then be submitted for reimbursement through the expense report system.   You may want to refrain from incurring any reimbursable expenses until we receive further assurances from the company that they have the processes in place to pay them.  As information becomes available about administrative operations, I will relay it to you.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

"Dynegy-Enron Deal Faces Significant Reg Review"," Dynegy-Enron Deal Faces Significant Reg Review
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

   
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.

Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. 


A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co. 


Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. 


A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. 


Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. 


Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. 


The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said. 

 
       Racing Against The Liquidity Clock 
   
""Enron is a complicated beast,"" and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would ""stretch FERC's limits of market-power review,"" one legal expert said. 

The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level. 


Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road. 


According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron's market share in competitive power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy's is pushing 5%. That makes the combined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under antitrust review. 


But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at both vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said. 


On a horizontal basis, there likely won't be much concern at FERC. Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesn't own but controls the output of on a contractual basis. 


It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC's merger review gets truly complicated. 


The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron's pipelines - including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada - and Dynegy's portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns. 


While Dynegy's pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron's, it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic. 


Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before, legal experts agreed. 


Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorney, is Enron's Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25% of wholesale power sales are traded. 


FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues. 


But even if FERC doesn't take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination. 


""These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they're trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy,"" noted one attorney. Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and natural gas. 


As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies weren't enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act. 


The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies. 


Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric, attorneys agreed. 


The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to a lawyer familiar with the deal. 


Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on the law. 


Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enron's selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. ""There are ways to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most people think about."" 


Given the race against the clock driven by Enron's increasingly perilous liquidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term. ""It's a run on the bank,"" the holding company act expert said. 


A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron's predominance in energy markets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal. 


""Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing,"" the analyst said. ""They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron.""

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"Hanson and Pilot Annuities","All,

I've entered an annuity for October and November Pilot Power scheduling fee, for the November Hanson Cement scheduling fee, and the book-to-book transfer between West Services and Short Term California to split the scheduling fee.  Currently, the fee for Pilot Power is $7,500 per month ($2,500 per load zone scheduled, SCE1, SDG1, and PGE3), and the scheduling fee for Hanson is $2,500.  The Enpower deal #'s are 855213, 855309, and 855318.

Please take a few moments to review these annuities.  Going forward, West Services will enter these annuities at the first of every month for the month ahead.

Phillip -
Thanks for the e-mail.  I spoke with David Reid (Division Manager -
Energy Marketing & Trading) regarding open trading positions.  He
indicated that he has one opening for a energy marketer (shift position)
that will be posted internally first.  If he doesn't get any qualified
applicants, he will look externally.  I would suggest you contact our
Human Resources area and complete an application so a current one will
be on file.  I will watch for the position to be posted and let you know
when it is opened to current employees - that will give you an idea of
the time frame for filling the position.  Good luck!
Laura Kapustka

	Attached are two PDF files, one detailing why the CAISO is going to start assessing Grid Management charges to A/S self-provision, and one detailing the budget breakdown for 2002.  The good news is that their proposal to FERC is not as bad as the first one presented at the last Market Issues Forum, but the increases are still steep.  Page 10 of the budget attachment has a graph detailing the old and new rates.  All that is left is for FERC to approve it.  The proposed new rates for 2002 will be as follows: 

CC	Old Rate:	New Rate:	Percentage Increase:	
				
521	0.406	0.575	42.00%	
522	0.223	0.368	65.00%

California Wary of Dynegy Bid to Buy Out Enron
Energy: Both companies are prominent players in the state's power market. The move to combine their strength is raising some concerns.
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS
TIMES STAFF WRITER

November 25 2001

Dynegy Inc. of Houston has been hailed as a hero on Wall Street, as it rides to deliver cross-town rival Enron Corp. from its self-inflicted ills and save energy markets from serious distress through its proposed $9-billion buyout of the world's largest energy trader.

But in California, Dynegy has a different image.

Dynegy, co-owner of several Southern California power plants, has been the quietest member of the ""Big Five"" group of energy producers commonly portrayed as villains by California politicians and regulators. Gov. Gray Davis and others have called Dynegy and its fellow energy suppliers ""gougers"" and ""pirates"" who manipulated the market and charged too much for electricity, precipitating California's blackout-studded energy crisis. Partly because of the heightened political sensitivities to all things surrounding California's energy problems, the state is expected to play a central role in the proposed merger between Dynegy and Enron, antitrust experts and others say. The state's Attorney General's office already has begun scrutinizing the proposed combination.

If it merges with Enron, another favorite Davis target, Dynegy would be a powerhouse in energy trading, electricity generation and natural gas transmission. And the combined firm would have a strong presence in California, which some find troubling.

""I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust implications would consider this one carefully,"" said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), one of the architects of California's failed foray into electricity deregulation, who became a fierce critic of power producers and resellers. ""If anything, Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to manipulate markets than it was before.""

Dynegy agreed on Nov. 9 to buy Enron through a stock swap valued at about $9 billion and to inject $2.5 billion into crumbling Enron provided by cash-rich ChevronTexaco Corp., the San Francisco-based oil company that owns nearly 27% of Dynegy. But a continuing trickle of disturbing financial disclosures keep slamming Enron's stock price, indicating that investors have their doubts that the deal will be completed as negotiated.

The Enron purchase would hurl Dynegy, which is about a quarter of Enron's size, into the top ranks of energy merchants.

In California's energy world, Dynegy already is a key company. At every significant twist in the state energy crisis, Dynegy was there, although not as visibly as some of the other power-plant owners and electricity resellers.

Enron and Reliant Energy Inc., also of Houston, and Duke Energy Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., drew particular fire from politicians and consumer advocates during the last 18 months as energy leaped higher. But Dynegy also was accused by the state's grid operator of reaping excessive profit through its electricity bidding practices and, to a lesser extent, by holding back some electricity from its Southern California power plants.

In addition, Dynegy signed long-term electricity contracts with the state that have been singled out by critics for containing potentially lucrative clauses requiring that the state pay emissions costs and other costs.

The California Independent System Operator, which runs the long-distance power transmission grid serving much of the state, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy from selling power at market prices. Cal-ISO has made the same request concerning the other major power plant owners: Duke, Reliant, Atlanta-based Mirant Inc. and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., which markets its power through an agreement with Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.

""Dynegy has sort of slid by under the radar,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, a consumer activist group.

""Not only did Dynegy do very well, but particularly its trading and marketing division did very well over the course of the last two years. It profited wildly.""

For its part, Dynegy rejects accusations of market manipulation, saying it has played a constructive role in the California marketplace, stepping forward to be one of the first companies to sign long-term contracts with the state when its need was greatest despite an electricity debt of $300 million owed the company by the state and its utilities.

""Dynegy has acted ethically and responsibly in California,"" said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa. ""The fundamental problem in California is that supply did not keep up with demand.""

""Dynamic Energy""

Accused of Overcharging

Dynegy was created in 1984 as a natural gas trading operation known as Natural Gas Clearinghouse to take advantage of the deregulation of natural gas prices. Under Chief Executive Chuck Watson, the company has expanded into natural gas processing and distribution and electricity generation, changing its name along the way to Dynegy, a word created by combining ""dynamic"" and ""energy.""

In California, Dynegy owns power plants capable of generating 2,800 megawatts of electricity through a partnership with NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis. (A megawatt can supply about 750 average homes with electricity.)

The state's big investor-owned utilities were required to sell some of their power plants by the landmark 1996 deregulation legislation. By the end of 1998, the Dynegy/NRG partnership had purchased three large power plants in Long Beach, El Segundo and San Diego and a collection of 17 small ""peaker"" plants from Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

Under the arrangement between the partnership, NRG operates the power plants and Dynegy markets the electricity from them. It is Dynegy's bidding practices in selling that power into state markets that put it, along with other energy producers, on the wrong side of the state grid operator and federal energy regulators.

Among the allegations:

* In a report released in March, Cal-ISO accused energy producers and resellers, including Dynegy, of overcharging Californians by $6.7 billion between May 2000 and March 2001. Power suppliers have denied the allegations. The report also found that Dynegy reaped about $32 million in ""monopoly rents"" between May and November of last year, or profits beyond what a competitive market would bear. That was the fourth-highest total for any company noted in the report. Enron was ranked sixth, taking $27.9 million in such profits.

* Cal-ISO said Dynegy maximized profits primarily through a practice known as ""economic withholding,"" or bidding electricity at prices so high that they would be rejected, thereby pushing up the price charged for the remaining generation sold into the market. Dynegy also did some ""physical withholding,"" Cal-ISO said, meaning that the company withheld electricity supplies to drive up the price.

* Dynegy was accused last April in hearings before state legislators of hoarding space on a key natural gas pipeline into California in 1998 and 1999, causing natural gas prices to soar. Dynegy executives testified that the charge was untrue.

* When federal regulators ordered $125 million in potential refunds for the first four months of the year, Dynegy's portion was the largest among the power sellers named, representing slightly more than one third. Dynegy said its prices were justified by high natural gas prices, emissions costs and other factors.

Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom said in April that the company was ""unfairly and inaccurately accused of withholding power from the California market.""

""As we have repeatedly communicated to California policymakers and regulators and to industry officials, we remain ready and willing to generate and sell power to any and all buyers at fair and reasonable prices when they are able to provide appropriate assurances that they will fulfill their obligation to pay for those purchases.""

A recent report by the state Department of Water Resources backs up Dynegy's assertions that its prices have been in line with the rest of the market.

During the first three months of this year, after sky-high prices pushed Edison and PG&E so close to insolvency that the state had to step in and buy power for their customers, Dynegy sold power to the DWR at an average price of $239.63 per megawatt-hour for electricity. That was slightly below the average of $268.90 per megawatt-hour charged by all sellers.

Dynegy portrays itself as a minor player in the California market, representing about 4% of the state's generation.

But Cal-ISO, in asking federal regulators to revoke Dynegy's authority to sell power at market rates, said ""Dynegy has profited systematically from the exercise of market power to the significant harm of California's electric consumers and economy."" A decision is pending.

Officials reviewing the Dynegy-Enron merger will closely review the companies' operations in California.

Although Enron owns no power plants in California, it is believed to have long-term contracts with some generators, although spokesman Eric Thode refused to detail them.

In addition, Enron has a hand in 25% of the energy trades around the nation, with a significant portion of that in California. Thode would not detail California operations, citing company policy.

Finally, Enron controls an undetermined amount of natural gas, which is used to generate about one-third of the state's electricity, through its transwestern pipeline, which crosses into California, and through natural gas marketing and trading arrangements.

It is those largely unregulated energy trading operations that have many energy watchdogs worried. They say that middlemen such as Enron and Dynegy can drive up the price of power by reselling it at higher prices each time.

A lawsuit filed in May against the Big Five generators by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, acting as a private citizen, described it this way: ""The Dynegy trading floor, working with the trading floors operated by Williams, Mirant, Reliant and Duke Energy is one of the principal tools the defendants used to inflate the price of electricity within their respective markets, as well as throughout the state of California.""

""These defendants engaged in trading of electricity futures, forwards, options and other risk products that had the effect of manipulating and inflating the price of electricity within their respective markets,"" the suit charged.

""These defendants engaged in 'megawatt laundering,' in which they made trades with the primary purpose of inflating the costs of electricity within their respective markets.""

State Is Examining Proposed Merger

California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has begun examining what effects such a merger would have on California, spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also will scrutinize the merger in a process that Dynegy and Enron expect will take no more than nine months.

Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said she plans to urge FERC to look beyond traditional measurements of how much the companies own in the market to examine ""inputs"" into the market such as gas pipeline capacity controlled by the companies and gas trading by Dynegy and Enron.

""It really raises many questions about how the market works,"" Bowen said.

Opposition by California could be a severe hindrance to the merger, said Garret Rasmussen, a lawyer with Patton Boggs in Washington, D.C., and formerly a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigator.

The state, if it chooses, could play as pivotal a role as it has in negotiations over the antitrust settlement between the federal government and Microsoft Corp., he said.

""While this administration has been quite tolerant of mergers ... an action by the California attorney general could have a significant chance of success,"" Rasmussen said.

Merger Might Reopen Contract Negotiation

The proposed merger might give California leverage to renegotiate its power contract with Dynegy, which contains the unusual provision that the state would pay for any emission costs that the company incurred, said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency & Renewable Technologies in Sacramento. Dynegy's large San Diego plant lacks crucial pollution control equipment, he said.

""The California attorney general needs to carefully examine Dynegy's environmental stewardship activities and renegotiate that provision in the long-term contract,"" White said. ""Dynegy has a Texas, the-least-we-can-do attitude as far as the environment is concerned.""

David Freemen, the former Los Angeles Department of Water & Power general manager who helped negotiate Dynegy's and other long-term contracts, said that while opportunities to renegotiate may present themselves, the agreements, now maligned as too expensive, were key to stabilizing the electricity market. Freeman praised Dynegy for its part in that process.

""There's a difference between companies that bargained hard with us and reached agreement--like Dynegy, Calpine and Williams--and those that were reaching for the moon and we didn't reach agreement,"" Freeman said. ""Dynegy knew that they wanted to do business in California, and do it in a businesslike manner.""

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

"Enron Files Chapter 11 Reorganization","To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

"New West Power Deal Info","Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

Guys,

Thinking of preserving value for the estate, I believe we need to focus on any in-the-money positions that have not been terminated.  Specifically, do any of them have collection risk due to contractual issues (one way termination upon bankruptcy or delivery default).  I am aware of the WAPA deal - are there others that should be a priority?

The following spreadsheet is a consolidation of counterparties that have not turned in termination letters.  I have also attached the list of terminations so that you can see the list we used.  If there are other counterparties that you know of that have not appeared on these lists, let me know and we will move them to the 'Bankruptcy Portfolio' we have set up.

   

Please let me know what other details you need and we will be happy to provide.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

"Ken Lay Resigns from Board","Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board.""

"FW: PNW Price Cap","Sean asked me to look into the timing of price cap decisions.  Here's what it looks like:

November 7th		Commission meets but highly unlikely that they adress NW price cap
November 9th		Written comments due to FERC
November 13th ish	FERC posts agenda for November 20th meeting
November 20th		FERC likely issues order on NW caps

Subject:	RE: PNW Price Cap

Tim, the issue is not on the agenda for the Commission's meeting on November 7.  This is no surprise, however, since written comments are still pending and not due until November 9 (Alan is preparing ours with my back-up).  Pat Wood said at the last Commission meeting that he doesn't wish to issue significant orders between meetings, so it is unlikely that FERC will act before its next scheduled meeting.  There is time pressure because winter is advancing.  Therefore our educated guess is that the order would issue at the next meeting following submittal of the comments, to be held on November 20.  The meeting agenda for this meeting will be available on the 13th or 14th; as soon as it issues we will let you know if it appears on the agenda.  In the meantime, if we hear anything more definitive we will let you know right away.  Ray

"CLARIFICATION: Parking & Mass Transit Options","Hello all!

We thought we would clarify the Parking & Mass Transit options:

1) Three options are available:

2WTC/Outside parking lots
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month

Tri-Met
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.

Daily Validations
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.

2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.

3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
Your HR Team

Subject:	Parking & Mass Transit Resolution

We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

If you have any questions, please let us know!

Due to the tentative completion date of the UBS deal, I think it would be wise for me to resume the duties of scheduling the California book as of Monday February 4, 2002. After meeting with Murray, I am under the impression that as of Wednesday you will be on UBS time and will not be doing the scheduling for the estate.

"CAISO NOTICE:  New Scheduling and Reporting Requirements For Outages","MARKET NOTICE
November 8, 2001
In Re:	San Diego Gas & Electric Company v Sellers of Energy and Ancillary
Services Into Markets Operated by the California Independent System Operator
and the California Power Exchange Docket No. EL00-95-034
and
		Investigation of Practices of the California independent
System Operator and the California Power Exchange Docket No.EL00-98-033
NEW SCHEDULING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR OUTAGES
The ISO has new scheduling and reporting requirements for scheduled and
forced outages.  By order dated October 23, 2001 (the ""Order""), in the
above-referenced dockets, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"")
formally adopted a majority of the California Independent System Operator
Corporation's (""ISO"") proposed Tariff amendments, filed on May 11, 2001,
concerning outage scheduling and coordination.  The Order is effective
retroactively to May 29, 2001.  The FERC took this action to allow the ISO
and generators to schedule maintenance outages in a manner that ensures
system reliability while also allowing the necessary maintenance of
generating units, and thus enable the ISO to help provide a more efficient
operation of the wholesale electricity markets in California to the benefit
of all customers.
This Market Notice is to inform all Market Participants of the Order and the
ISO's implementation process for the adopted Tariff provisions governing
scheduling of outages and procedures for the reporting and investigation of
forced outages.  The Order is posted on the ISO web site at
<http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/rulings/>.  The ISO's compliance filing,
filed with FERC on November 7, 2001, is posted on the ISO web site at
<http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/>.
In the Order, the FERC specifically ordered that:
*	The ISO now has outage scheduling and coordination authority for all
Participating Generators (PGs) and Generating Units of 10MW and greater
under their control.  
*	Under the extended authority, all PGs seeking to schedule outages
for any generating unit of 10MW or greater must submit to the ISO a request
for an outage no less than seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the
requested outage start time. 
*	All PGs must request and obtain final approval from the ISO
immediately prior to the initiation of any planned and approved outage.
*	The ISO is required to report to FERC within seven (7) days of the
occurrence of any questionable forced outage.  As required by the Order, the
ISO has filed with the FERC proposed Tariff revisions listing specific
factors the ISO will consider in making an initial determination if a forced
outage is a questionable forced outage.
*	The ISO will require, as detailed below, PGs to provide information
on each of the factors as part of the ISO's initial determination whether
any particular outage is a questionable forced outage.
*	PGs must comply with enhanced reporting requirements and more
promptly inform the ISO of outages and other operating conditions that
potentially may impact the generating output of the generating unit.
Effective immediately, the ISO requires all Scheduling Coordinators and PGs
to implement the following actions when reporting scheduled or forced PG
unit outages:
1.)	Apply to the ISO for approval of all scheduled outages no less than
seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the start-time for the requested
outage. 
2.)	Obtain final approval from the ISO Real-Time Generation Dispatcher
prior to disabling any equipment that may reduce the output capability of a
PG unit.
3.)	Report to the ISO Real-Time Generation Dispatcher all forced outages
or other factors which may affect the output of any PG unit within 30
minutes of the onset. 
4.)	 In the event of any forced outage affecting the output of a PG
unit:
	a.)	complete the form entitled ""Forced Outage Reporting
Questionnaire,"" attached to this Market Notice and also posted on the ISO
web site at
<http://www2.caiso.com/docs/2001/02/01/2001020108211325518.html>; and
	b.)	send the completed Forced Outage Report via e-mail to
forcedoutage@caiso.com within forty-eight (48) hours of the beginning of the
Forced Outage.  Failure to send a timely report will result in the ISO
reporting any such Forced Outage to the FERC as a questionable Forced
Outage. 
Please direct any questions about this procedure to Greg Van Pelt, ISO
Manager of Outage Coordination, at gvanpelt@caiso.com
<mailto:gvanpelt@caiso.com> or (916) 351-2190.

"CAISO Notification: Demand Relief Program Settlement Charge Types","	This is a reminder that the Summer 2001 ISO Demand Relief Program
charges are reflected on the June 30 statements and June invoices.  As
announced previously this year, the ISO has developed a Summer 2001 Demand
Relief Program (DRP).   The program is designed to provide an additional
level of demand reduction on the ISO system that can be implemented during a
stage 2 Emergency in an effort to prevent involuntary load curtailments or
rotating blackouts associated with a Stage 3 Emergency.  

	Similar to last years program, the same charge types are utilized
for capacity, Charge Type 7 and 117, described in the first link below.  Two
new Charge Types, 3472 and 3482,  have been created for the energy payment
and allocation when contracted loads are called upon to curtail, described
in the second link below.  Although the program was initiated in June, no
calls were made to curtail load, therefore, charges 3472 and 3482 were not
utilized.    The periods in which the Demand Relief Program was called upon
to initiate interruptions of contracted loads can be found at the third link
below.

"Rhetorical Excess, Says Lockyer","

January 23, 2002 
Dow Jones Newswires
Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

Could Enron's Business Model Actually Work?

January 28, 2002 

By DANIEL ALTMAN


 

Is Enron (news/quote)'s business model still a good one?
With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away,
the answer may be yes. Despite Enron's collapse, its goal
of merging the best thinking in energy, finance and
information technology as an online commodity trader still
garners respect. 

""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basic
virtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chief
executive and research director of the META Group
(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""There
is still a real market for virtual trading companies, no
question about it."" 

Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,
later, other products like rights to high-speed
telecommunications networks and financial hedges against
changes in the weather. It used a sophisticated online
platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the
company's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst who
follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the company
had ""the pioneering online venture for real-time
availability of information"" used in trading commodities. 

*  
Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yet
serve as a model for other companies. In the wake of
Enron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support for
that model model came from its competitors. 

Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companies
that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for
electricity and natural gas. 

""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron
went away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief
operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant. 

""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayed
basically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of one
intermediary just proves that these competitive markets
work."" 

Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill
the gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked up
market share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,
that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremely
important and a big income earner for us, is not the
centerpiece of our business."" 

Another company that sees continued value in the Enron
approach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, which
bought Enron's electricity and gas trading business in
bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its
own brand. 

""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" David
Walker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-rate
trading platform."" 

Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivatives
business and Enron's trading of energy contracts were one
factor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""The
characteristics of trading these types of products and
betting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,
are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors."" 

Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had
""outstanding"" information technology organization that was
backed by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way as
well, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to the
best financial companies out there."" 

Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnick
predicted, UBS would have little difficulty regaining
Enron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that it
shouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a couple
seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market
inefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" 

According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field
of finance, the company did not necessarily come up with a
lot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizing
existing ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. 

""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the
context of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, a
professor of finance at the University of Texas who once
consulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they were
doing."" 

Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,
advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.
He said the company needed advanced financial tools to
price its derivatives, which specified energy products to
be delivered at various times and sites while demand was
uncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probably
breaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" he
said. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe and
may be hard to do."" 

Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business School
who studied Enron, said the company had been using what
would be considered ""best practices"" for using derivatives
by any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's. 

Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, it
might still survive today. 

""Enron could have done extremely well with betting on
market inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""People
stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own
theories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when it
could no longer cover the ever-higher risks it began
taking. 

Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, by
throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash
flow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on its
network capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which never
turned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,
financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demise
like a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts of
this story."" 

But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online trading
system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might
not rule out future, similar endeavors. 

""In any commodity, there are always people who have too
much and others who have too little, so there's always
going to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""
Professor Tufano said. 

Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simply
ill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" he
said. He noted that the deregulation of electricity and
natural gas led to a long period during which the market
for energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It does
take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable
with the idea that they should risk-manage and out-source
their use of that commodity.""

"2002 FTR Auction Notice","
				FTR Auction Participants
				ISO Market Participants

				Re: Potential Participants in the 2002
Annual FTR Auction:

				The ISO is actively involved in preparing
for the next auction of Firm Transmission Rights (FTRs) set for mid-to-late
January 2002.  The upcoming auction will be very similar to the auction held
last year.  The FTRs to be auctioned will be in effect from April 1st, 2002
through March 31st, 2003.

				If you are interested in participating in
this year's auction, please send an e-mail stating your interest to Jim
McClain by COB Monday October 15, 2001.  Jim's e-mail is jmcclain@caiso.com
and his phone number is (916) 608-7072.  Please provide your company's exact
name and acronym, e-mail address, physical address, phone number and the
person to whom we should send the required auction information.  Entities
notifying the ISO of their interest in the 2002 FTR Auction will be added to
a more focused distribution list.  After gathering responses from all
interested parties the ISO will only send FTR-related information to this
specific distribution list.    

				The ISO is evaluating the training
requirements and schedules for potential auction participants along with
other information related to the 2002 auction.  We will post this
information on the FTR Auction site at
(http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/ftr/) and distribute it directly to the
potential FTR Auction Participants.  This site will be different from last
year's site to avoid confusion between the previous and next auction.

				Thank you for your assistance.

"CAISO Notice - Changes to Provision of Data to CERS","MARKET NOTICE
November 30, 2001

In Re: 	California Independent System Operator Corporation
		Docket Nos. ER01-3013-000 and ER01 889-009 Compliance Filing
		Changes to Provision of Data to CERS
ISO Market Participants:
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") November 7 and 20, 2001
orders, require the ISO, among other things, to stop providing information
to the California Department of Water Services, California Energy Resource
Scheduling (""CERS"") which is not also provided to other Scheduling
Coordinators (""SCs"").  Set forth below is the ISO's schedule for halting
provision of such data to CERS.
A.	Information Already Stopped
1.	On November 13, 2001, the ISO stopped providing to CERS the BEEP
Stack prices for hourly aggregate Mw. 
2.	On November 16, 2001, ISO stopped providing to CERS the PG&E, SCE
and SDG&E Hour-Ahead Schedules. 
B.	Schedule to Stop Additional Market Information Relating to
Forecasts, BEEP Stack and OOM Costs 
1.	At HE2400 on November 30, 2001, the ISO will stop providing to CERS
information on:
a.	Munis' Hour-Ahead Schedules; 
b.	Hourly Direct Access Load;
c.	ISO forecasted Load per IOU;
d.	Average Hourly BEEP Stack volume and costs, including both
incremental and decremental bids and prices;
e.	Real Time OOM volume and average OOM prices;
f.	Daily Energy purchases (i.e., total cost by Hour and Day);
g.	Hour-Ahead and Day-Ahead Congestion volume and clearing prices; and

prices 
			The ISO will post on its Home Page information
pertaining to items a, b, c, e, f, and h.  The ISO already posts items d and
g.
2.	Beginning on December 3, 2001, the ISO will begin to publish on the
OASIS site each IOU's actual Hourly Load and the ISO forecasted Hourly Load
per IOU.
3.	The ISO will also publish the projected hourly Imbalance Energy
requirement one hour prior to the start of real time.
4.	Beginning at  HE2400 on December 6, 2001:
a.	The ISO will halt the preferential provision to CERS of the ISO
Forecasted net short in the BEEP Stack;
b.	CERS will no longer engage in OOM purchases; and
c.	The ISO will dispatch all available Energy from bids in the BEEP
Stack for both resources prior to the ISO making OOM purchases.

"DRAFT CAISO Notice - Dual Invoicing to resume trade month November 2001","		MARKET NOTICE
		January 4, 2002

		Resumption of Preliminary Invoicing

		ISO Market Participants:
	SC Settlement Contacts:

		The ISO will resume issuing Preliminary Invoices starting
with the November 2001 trade month.  
		On August 30, 2001, the ISO distributed a notice indicating
that it would temporarily suspend making cash distributions based on
preliminary invoices.  The notice further indicated that this practice was
to be effective for the June, 2001 billing cycle. Beginning with the July
2001 trade month, the ISO temporarily halted issuance of the preliminary
invoices entirely.  Subsequently, the ISO issued a single monthly invoice on
the date that it issued the Final Settlement Statement for the last Trade
Day of the calendar month. Thus, the ISO neither collected nor dispersed
funds until the final invoice was distributed.  
		This suspension of the ""two invoice"" settlements approach
was a temporary action.  The ISO will resume issuing Preliminary Invoices
starting with November 2001 trade month.  This is consistent with ISO's
proposal in the November 21, 2001 compliance filing for FERC's November 7
order.  November 2001 Preliminary Invoices are scheduled to be generated on
January 29, 2002.
		If you have questions regarding this procedure, please
contact your Account Manager.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Peter,

Who are you going to use as ""scheduling coordinator"" when you start scheduling?  If it is someone other that Enron Power Marketing, Inc. I think that you need only send the schedule to me, however we will ultimately need to be provided with the actual production to verify the amount of production that is ultimately invoiced.  

If Enron Power Marketing, Inc. will continue to be scheduling coordinator then resume the same list of people that you were previously sending the schedule to.  I am not sure how many of the previous list of individuals are still with Enron but if you can provide the list of individuals I can try to determine which individuals are still here and who, if anyone else, to sent the schedule to.

Richard

Phillip -
Thanks for the e-mail.  I spoke with David Reid (Division Manager -
Energy Marketing & Trading) regarding open trading positions.  He
indicated that he has one opening for a energy marketer (shift position)
that will be posted internally first.  If he doesn't get any qualified
applicants, he will look externally.  I would suggest you contact our
Human Resources area and complete an application so a current one will
be on file.  I will watch for the position to be posted and let you know
when it is opened to current employees - that will give you an idea of
the time frame for filling the position.  Good luck!

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"OR4NE Night at Winterhawks Hockey","OR4NE Night at the WinterHawks -
Top 10 reasons to clear your evening on Sunday, Feb. 24, 2002, 5:00 pm
and be at Memorial Coliseum:
10. You want an excuse to go to a hockey game.
9. You want to go with people you know you'll have fun with.
8. You want to bring along additional people so we can have at least 50
people and get an official Winter Hawks hockey puck...to be utilized at a 
future event, like the Colorado game.
7. You know far enough in advance to actually be ABLE to clear your evening.
6. We'll get to see our name up in lights.
5. The opposing team is Tri-Cities, an apparently very ""physical"" rival.
4. We're NOT going on the same night as the church groups and cub scout troops.
3. Tickets are only $11.50 per person and the theme is Dream Vacation.
2. If it's a raving success, we'll go back for their Big XII night on
March 15, with a pre-game banquet to schmooze with other Alumni groups.
And the #1 reason to go to the game is. . . 

We can still wear our Husker red since they were smart enough to make the 
WinterHawk colors red, white and black. GO BIG RED!!!!!!!!

If you have any questions, feel free to email Lisa Martin at
lamartin59@aol.com, or call at (503) 913-6271. Send your check ($11.50
per ticket), payable to Oregonians for Nebraska to Lisa at 401 S. Everest 
Road #2 Newberg OR 97132.  We must have your check prior to February
10th.  Hope to see you then and GO BIG RED!

Importance: High


Paul,

As I indicated in my follow-up call this afternoon, the following procedure
should be used to make any scheduling changes to the Basic WAPA Allocation,
Excess Energy, or Additional Energy during the month in which a monthly
preschedule was agreed by the parties (prior to the beginning of the
month).

   1. Contact the SCE Day Ahead Prescheduling line at:  626-302-3320
        and inform them of the Scheduling Change and that the change will
   be confirmed via FAX or e-mail.

   2. Send a confirmation note with the Scheduling Change via FAX to:
   626-302-3213, or via email at:   presched@sce.com

As we have indicated in prior communications, Edwards will be assessed an
Additional Scheduling and Dispatch (AS&D) charge (currently $131.00) for
each change that is made to any of the Schedules.  This charge is in
addition to the daily Scheduling and Dispatch charge of $131.00 per day for
each delivery point (Mead, Blythe, and SP-15) where energy is scheduled for
delivery to SCE.

Please communicate this procedure to the Enron and WAPA energy scheduling
folks.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

"Parking - ACTION REQUIRED","For the past several weeks, we have been working diligently to receive the parking subsidy from Houston.  However, due to the bankruptcy filing Enron has not been able to process checks.  

For the month of December, you will be personally responsible for your parking. This includes all parking lots (Lot 108, Lot 303, the WTC parking garage) and any parking validations.  

If you have been parking in Lot 108, Lot 303 or Lot 2WTC, your responsibility begins 12/1/01.  For those parking in other lots, we will be unable to reimburse employees for the month of December.

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, we will stop the deduction on the 12/31/01 pay period.  Grace and I are working on a resolution plan for the monies that were deducted incorrectly, so please be patient as we work through the various issues. 

It has not been determined whether Enron will continue to subsidize parking but you will be notified as soon as we receive information from Corporate.

We sincerely apologize for the insufficient notice and the inconvenience that this may have caused.  Again, thank you for the patience.  We are all trying to do our best in a difficult situation!

Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B.   His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.  I beat Jeff in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.   We were friends but didn't really like each other if that makes any sense.  Personally, I quit hanging out with him when he wanted to always take our shirts off and wrestle on his sisters bed.  I thought he was a little weird.  He did show up to Mitch's visitation which meant alot to me.  I would support Siegrist.  Do not forward this to anyone.

"Office Update","Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron.  

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addition to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepted positions with UBS Warburg:

Last Name	First Name	Last Name	First Name

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

"Final Benefits Memo","

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

"2001 Special Stock Option Grant Awards","We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?	A ""How to Exercise Options"" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Please take time to review this material.  It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative.

"FSP Ready Again for Production","Good Afternoon FSP users,

We have just finished a comprehensive FSP rebuild & testing phase for the next release of FSP.  The rebuild should address all the issues raised in the previous go-live as well as some additional capabilities for robustness.  Please note that we have already executed several hundred different test case scenarios & performed some stress testing using data before the Enron collapse.

What we need now is help from you to continue to identify enhancements and/or bugs with FSP so that we can go-live with FSP once the new company starts trading.  Susan Amador will be available to help in any testing.  You should probably also coordinate with her when you are about to start testing so that our continuing testing doesn't interfere with your testing.  PWRTESTN & PWRTESTP should be all setup for your use.

Here are some of the bug fixes & enhancements we have rolled-out with this latest release:
1.  Bid Curve - Ability to bid on zero volumes (for import, export, and wheels)
2.  Rebuild of all FSP application utilizing Direct Oracle Access components for faster database access & higher reliability.
3.  Bug Fixes on database commits to eliminate database ""deadlocks"".
4.  New aggregation scout to ""stream-line"" the template writing process & improve template writing performance.
5.  SQL tuned ""Hour Ahead"" template writing.  Confirmed performance of 1min 30 seconds on heavy transaction volume days.
6.  And many other small previously unidentified bugs.

We are very excited about this newest release and are looking forward to your feedback over the next couple of days.  Susan will probably be your best contact but please feel free to contact me at anytime.

Thanks,  David Poston

"ISO Increase in Grid Management Charges","All,
	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.  Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.  
	The CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002.  They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volumes are, thus reducing the amount of megawatts they can effectively spread out their GMC charges over.  
	I have the following observations:  1.  Despite the decrease in volumes, and the decrease in overall market activity, the CAISO has no plans to reduce its current workforce of 500+ employees.  2.  When posed the question: Is CERS charged GMC for out of market energy?  Their answer was circumspect at best.   3.  The CAISO currently does not assess GMC charges to ancillary service volumes, they indicated however that they are strongly considering changing this policy to increase the denominator that they can spread out GMC.  
	The CAISO would also like to point out that these increases are worse case scenarios, and may not be this high.  But as we are all aware, in the California energy market, the worst-case scenario ends up looking optimistic in comparison to what actually ends up happening.  Below is a detailing of the changes.  

-Kit

Charge Code	Description	Current Rate	Proposed New Rate	Percentage Increase	
521	Control Area Services Charge	$0.4060 	$0.5140 	27%	
522	Inter-zonal Scheduling Charge	$0.2230 	$0.3080 	38%	
523	Market Operations Charge	$0.9510 	$1.6080 	69%

Enron Receives Dynegy $1.5B Cash Infusion Tues. >DYN ENE
By Christina Cheddar
  
11/14/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies' merger agreement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said. 


Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment.


The cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy's largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations. 


The rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger. The deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next six to nine months. 


Dynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion based on the recent price of Dynegy shares. 


The acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about Enron's financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers. The dealings are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits. 


During the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated. As credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron's debt ratings threatening the company's investment-grade status, the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business. 


Industry experts viewed Dynegy's cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader's liquidity, and protect its most valuable business. 


In a conference call earlier Wednesday, Enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events. 


According to Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser, the preferred stock Dynegy has received for its investment in Enron is convertible into the common stock of the Enron pipeline unit. 


Dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into Enron shares if it desires, the spokeswoman said. 


For example, if Enron were to cancel its merger with Dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor, Dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into Enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in Enron's stock price, Rosser said. 


In either case, Dynegy wouldn't be required to pay any additional consideration. 


Dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after ChevronTexaco, of San Francisco, made an investment in Dynegy. 


If the acquisition closes as anticipated, ChevronTexaco, which owns about one-fourth of Dynegy, plans to make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company. ChevronTexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $1.5 billion in Dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition. 


Enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market's reaction to the cash infusion, and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties. 


Enron remains on a credit watch at the credit-rating agencies. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's each have Enron rated one notch above speculative grade.

"CAISO Notice - Revised Operating Procedure M-401 - Real-Time and Forward Intra-Zonal Congestion Management","MARKET NOTICE
January 16, 2002
Revised Operating Procedure M-401
Real-Time and Forward Intra-Zonal Congestion Management
ISO Market Participants:
On December 12, 2001 the ISO posted on its web site a version of ISO
Operating Procedure M-401 that included certain language potentially giving
the impression that the ISO determines what is and what is not a reasonable
competitive bid.  Additionally, this version of the Operation Procedure
included a provision for the exclusive use of Reliability Must-Run (RMR)
units in areas the ISO has deemed to be noncompetitive and this provision is
in conflict with the requirements of Section 4.1 of the Must-Run Service
Agreement. 
The ISO has removed the December 12, 2001 version of operating procedure
M-401 from the ISO web site and posted a revised version at
http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/marketops/.  The revised
version includes procedures for: 
*	Eliminating ""competitive"" and ""non-competitive"" intra-zonal
congestion areas;
*	Modifying the use of RMR units for resolving intra-zonal congestion
to reflect the requirements of the Must-Run Service Agreement;
*	Eliminating the ISO's review of market bids for ""reasonableness"",
while retaining the ISO's obligation to report bids it considers potentially
noncompetitive to the ISO's Department of Market Analysis and to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission; and  
*	Modifying the steps the ISO will take to relieve intra-zonal
congestion it predicts may occur due to pre-scheduled clearances.
The revised Operating Procedure M-401 has been posted on the ISO web site at
www.caiso.com/thegrid/operations/opsdoc/marketops.
If you have questions, please contact The ISO Operating Procedures Control
Desk at procctrldesk@caiso.com <mailto:procctrldesk@caiso.com>  or your

"Enron In Talks With 3 Financial Companies For Joint Venture","Enron In Talks With 3 Financial Companies For Joint Venture 
Updated: Monday, December 3, 2001 06:52 PM ET 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. is negotiating with three financial institutions of ""impeccable creditworthiness"" regarding a joint venture aimed at restarting its trading operation, said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for the company. 
Enron expects to announce its joint venture partner within weeks, according to Bienenstock. 
The joint venture would use that institution's financial means to guarantee that Enron would pay its bills. 
Also Monday, at a court hearing Enron announced $1.5 billion in debtor in possession financing from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
The company said that it needs about $250 million for immediate operating needs. Currently, Enron has about $500 million in cash.

"PREPAYS","Chris, a couple things about the prepays for 1.13/1.19.

1. Is the ""Avista possible additional power""a done deal or is it a day to day basis??   When should it be scheduled?

2. Could you email the details on your prepay deals to Phil and I, just in case we have questions regarding them.

3. I have looked over the calculation sheet you showed me yesterday (Tuesday) for the wire to Avista and I have found a mistake. We are not currently delivering to City of Shasta Lake (28mw RTC).

Attached is the new scheduling sheet to point to the new databases for the ESTATE.  The current Excel models will work until the final seperation between Enron and UBSW (Next Thursday).  I do not know who is responsible for the Estate scheduling, but fowarding it to you for now.  More than likely, the sheet I am sending you will not work since you do not have access to the database.  If you have the final answer to who will be doing the Scheduling the Estate, please send me and CC an Email to Sonny Seaton requesting access to SQDV001d Scheduling database.

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.
