Subject: gas load at Aluminum Ingot plants


Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

Question on index curves. What index curves do you need?

	a. the curves from egs_curves that are inserted into the

	   risk type code = 'I' and curve_type_cd = 'PR'.

	b. the curves from the pub posting that are inserted into

Let's gauge the interest in a first-person shooter: 
Through Allan, we have several at our disposal, and if we want to own them, there are a ton of great ones available at sub-basement prices.  However, let's try before we buy (if you haven't already).  Current options include Rogue Spear (very realistic and detailed), Quake (fragtastic), and Tribes (all about teamwork).  There are others, too, but these were the ones Allan and I were chatting about.
You folks wanna try this?

   jobs
   at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
   through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact
   a
   bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an
   offer
   from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the
   market,
   who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company

   Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at
   Enron.

Enron
Enron  is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications  companies. The company, which owns approximately $37 billion in energy and  communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, delivers physical  commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the  world, and has developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online  business - EnronOnline. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com << File: http://www.enron.com/ >> . The stock is traded under the  ticker symbol ""ENE"".
 
 
Is this correct? I thought Enron didn't produce  electricity...or natural gas....just transported it....

or monthly basis. Your financial statements have a quarterly cross-section in a fairly
similar format, but I was hoping I could get more specific numbers, including the type
of industrial user (high-tech, aluminum, agricultural, etc.) and historicals back to last
winter. If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate it, as trying to forecast NWPL
load without some general NW Natural data is impossible.

Thanks,

If Beth OKs it I can do a strategy session. That last email from 
Devil-Pooch made me 
yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle. 
The key to Allan's wins (and I have given it some thought): 
1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build 
stone walls, 
        encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. 
And to seal us off. 
2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as 
his army is killed. 
        Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources 
until the point 
he decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army 
is concentrated 
and huge. 
3) Build castles on conquered territory. 
If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as 
soon as we each have a 
40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of 
trebuchets is imperative. 
We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill. 
AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not 
attacking, 
it's over.

Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

"RE: FW: football","We are totally LBs. no DEs. We had a bad defensive game, which I hope turns around next week,
as we have good people at those positions. Our defense has been one of the best.
PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game, but
he has good people as well. Our head-to-head with him in 2 weeks is key. Curtis Martin
is a bye for him, so he picked up Watters. But you saw last night how dominant Shaun
Alexander is. If he has a good game next week, he may have the starting role or at
least split carries. 
The next 2 games will be tough.

This Pump and go deep clown is so lucky we didn't blow him out.  We need more linebackers less DEs.  He got lucky / we need a better defense.  Great call on the Staley tip.

Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job?

"RE: OK Team","If Beth OKs it I can do a strategy session. That last email from Devil-Pooch made me
yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle.
The key to Allan's wins (and I have given it some thought):
1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build stone walls,
	encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. And to seal us off.
2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as his army is killed.
	Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources until the point
he decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army is concentrated 
and huge.
3) Build castles on conquered territory.

If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as soon as we each have a
40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of trebuchets is imperative.
We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill.
AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not attacking,
it's over.

Subject:	OK Team


If any of you are available for some strategy practices tonight...choose what civ's we'll play and practice leveraging their strengths against an enemy.  We have failed to play like a team in every battle yet, we must improve our solidarity as a fighting force.  I think that means setting team members' priorities for army segments.
Ex: Beth goes Byzantine and provides us with some walls and infantry, I gor Briton and provide archers and siege weapons, Jay goes nuts with knights and monks. We attack one base eliminating hostile towers and units, and then allow the siege weapons to level the buildings with archer and monk support.  Knights at perimeter to protect army while we finish the job and beth building some protective walls to add to the trouble the enemy must go throught o attack us while we FINISH OFF every base.
I also suspect that twot hings have really added to allan's victories. 
1) Walls everywhere.  We have to knock the m down to get to him and he'll always know about it. 
2) Guard shacks every where.  He always sees where we are.  We never know where he is. 
So, who can play with me tonight?  My place?  Your place?  Office?

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Jim,

I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount

I appreciate whatever help you can provide.

I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your criticisms.
By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin.
Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite
our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of common
interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke a pact
to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave
Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul.

P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me,

Subject:	Petition to the United Nations against subhuman treatment of wome	n in Afghanistan


If you decide not to forward this,  please send it back 
to Darleene Barrientos [darleeneah@earthlink.net ]. This is  an actual 
petition, and ""signatures"" 
will be lost if you drop the  line. 
  
  
Please take 3 minutes out of  your life to do your 
part. And be sure to include other members of your  
household who are willing to sign. 
Petition to the United Nations  Background Information: 
Madhu, the government of  Afghanistan, is waging a war 
upon women. Since the Taliban took power in  1996, 
women have had to wear burqua and have been 
beaten and stoned in  public for not having the proper 
attire, even if this means simply not  having the mesh 
covering in front of their eyes. One woman 
was beaten  to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists 
for accidentally exposing her  arm(!) while she was 
driving. Another was stoned to death for 
trying  to leave the country with a man that was not a 
relative. 
Women are not allowed to work  or even go out in public 
without a male relative; professional women such  as 
professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists and 
writers have  been forced from their jobs and 
restricted to their homes. Homes where a  woman is 
present must have their windows painted so that she 
can never  be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent 
shoes so that they are never  heard. Women live in fear 
of their lives for the slightest misbehavior.  Because 
they cannot work, those without male 
relatives or husbands are  either starving to death or 
begging in the street, even if they hold  Ph.D.'s. 
Depression is becoming so widespread that it has 
reached  emergency 
levels. There is no way in such an extreme Islamic 
society  to know the suicide rate with certainty, but 
relief workers are estimating  that the suicide rate 
among women must be 
extraordinarily high: those  who cannot find proper 
medication and treatment for severe depression and  
would rather take their lives than live in such 
conditions. At one of  the rare hospitals for women, a 
reporter found still, nearly lifeless  bodies 
lying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in their 
burqua,  unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but 
slowly wasting away. Others  have gone mad and were 
seen crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or  
crying, most of them in fear. 
It is at the point where the  term ""human rights 
violations"" has become an understatement. Husbands  
have the power of life and death over their women 
relatives,  especially their wives, but an angry 
mob has just as much right to stone  or beat a woman, 
often to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or  
offending them in the slightest way. Women 
enjoyed relative freedom:  to work, to dress generally 
as they wanted, and to drive and appear in  public 
alone until only 1996. The rapidity of this 
transition is the  main reason for the depression and 
suicide; Women who were once educators  or doctors or 
simply used to basic human freedoms are now 
severely  restricted and treated as subhuman in the 
name of right-wing  fundamentalist Islam. It is not 
their tradition or 'culture', but it is  
alien to them, and it is extreme even for those 
cultures where  fundamentalism is the rule. Everyone 
has a right to a tolerable human  
existence, even if they are women in a Muslim country. 
If we can threaten military  force in Kosovo the name 
of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians,  
citizens of the world can certainly express 
peaceful outrage at the  oppression, murder and 
injustice committed against women by the Taliban.  
STATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current 
treatment of women in Afghanistan is completely  
UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the 
United Nations and that the  current situation overseas 
will not be tolerated. 
Women's Rights is not a small issue  anywhere, and it 
is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be treated as  
subhuman and as so much property. Equality 
and human decency is a  fundamental RIGHT, not a 
freedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan 
or elsewhere.

So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for jobs
at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact a
bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an offer
from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the market,
who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company called
Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at Enron.
Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we

"RE: gas load at Aluminum Ingot plants","Keith,
I am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these
respective meters on NWPL:

Ferndale, WA plant (reduced capacity) -  meter 472
Wematchee, WA plant (closed) - 446
Longview, WA plant (closed) - 227
Troutdale, OR plant (closed) - 302

Could you confirm that the Troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not
nominate through the Cascade LDC?
This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply.

Also, it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the
above plants closed or reduced capacity.

I appreciate any help you can give me.

Subject: gas load at Aluminum Ingot plants


Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe
Trading Analyst

"RE: FW: football","I'm up on all that. I was on my way to Portland, so couldn't pick up Canidate. However, it looks
like Faulk only has bruised bone and will be back in 1-2 weeks.
Shaun Alexander was the big miss, that guy could be a stud.
We won again, and are 4th in the league with a good shot to win our next 2.
Surprising, considering how shitty Thrash has become. 

I will be back from Portland Wed night so I will probably see you at some point.

      Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
   e-mail.
      I'm
      doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the

      for
      a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your

I forgot to tell you how mad I was as I got into the book that I am reading. You wouldn't believe how much Goodkind has ripped off from Jordan. I actually got out of bed to check the publishing dates on the books. 80% of Jordan's work was published up to 4 years before Goodkind. 80% of his ideas are ripped off by Goodkind. You would think that I would be so disgusted that I would boycott Goodkind. Unfortunately, my irritation does not reach that far. It is like finishing up a bowl of BlueBell Ice Cream, wanting another but having no more Bluebell and so settling for the marshmallow imitation generic grocery brand - empty calories that are not nearly as satisfying. I am so weak...

If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news.

But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like
myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they are 
immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up 
your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus predicted).

"Kern Las Vegas","
Patti, Stacey,

The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as -
Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission
Zone: Las Vegas
Facility: UNA - Las Vegas

It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of -
Harry Allen (2-4015)
Apex (2-4002)
Blue Diamond (2-4016)
Pecos (2-4013)
Lone Mountain (2-4012)

Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking
a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.

The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will
bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,

I have an overwhelming need to leave. I am highly frustrated, but you don't seem to listen. I am tired. I need to do something about the situation, because it is NOT improving. I am tired of bitching, complaining, criticizing, being hurt, and most of all not being taken care of. You do not treat me like a friend half the time, much less a partner. I really think that I need to go where I am going to stay and establish my adult life. I think that the Virginias or Carolinas would be a nice place, because of the climate, location, schools, etc. I would like to go there, establish residency, and maybe go to school. Otherwise, I would just like to leave, by a house, and build a little bit of security. 
I need something.
