"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

for your Online business or store front?

What is A Merchant Account?
- A merchant account is what you need to be able to accept
credit cards for sales or services.

Why do I need a Merchant account?
- Being able to accept credit cards for purchases make it much
easier and faster for your long distance customers.

Do I need to have an established store to get a merchant account?
-  No. It does not mater what you sell, at auction or on your
web site or even in your store front. we offer different account
to suite your personal needs.

What are your fee's?
-  Just like every person is unique, every account we sell is
unique to you and your business, therefore we can not state a
price until we know more about the account you need.<br>

How Do I get a merchant account?
-  All you need to do to get a merchant account is fill out the
form bellow and one of your reps. will call you with more information or get you started.

Can I call you instead?
-  We have in the past given a number to call for more information and to sign up, but the number of calls we where getting was too large and our customers where complaining about being on hold too long or not getting through at all. Therefore we now have a structure system of sales reps calling each and every customer in order of there submission to help them out.  We have found this system much more productive and less chaotic.


    I hope I have answered all your questions about Merchant Accounts and how to get one,  but if I have not please fill out the application, one of our sales reps will answer any other questions you may have

"FW: Summer Trip","
Are these dates still ok with you?
 
We are going camping July 19, 20, 21 and coming home on the 22.  We  are going to Austin Lone Star RV Campgrounds.  Johnye Leigh, Steve,   Vickye, Billy, Granny, Morgan, and PaPaw are going.  I would love it  if the four of you could go with us, also.  Granny wants to ride a train on  Saturday.  I got a two room cabin that we can all stay in.  Just bring  sleeping bags if you have any!!!  It will be fun.  They have a  swimming pool and jacuzzi.  We changed the date a week up, because Morgan  couldn't go it we didn't.  We have gone to New Braunfels the fourth weekend  of July for 10 years.  Mark purposely planned his trip the fourth weekend,  so Morgan couldn't go with us!!!  So we moved our trip up a week, so she  can still go!!!
 
Let me know,
 
Love Mom

  [IMAGE]  Welcome back to eJoin Finance News, where there's always time to get in on a hot property and always time to bail when that ""sure thing"" heads south.   In this issue?  Collection Agency Harassment Junior Investors: UGMAs Index Funds: An overview  Very few things make me happier than receiving your email (My therapist says I'm making great progress though!). Please send any finance-related material, questions or stories to editor@ejoin.com [IMAGE]       The statements contained in this newsletter that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  You should consult with a certified financial advisor prior to making investment decisions.           [IMAGE]             Collection Agency Harassment and What to do About it.       If you've lived long enough, then the chances are pretty good that you've had at least one run-in with a collection agency. Chances are even better that it was a thoroughly unenjoyable experience.   Whether your debt is the result of investments gone south, unexpected medical expenses or a struggling home business, you still have a ton of rights as a citizen of this great nation. One of those is the right to not be harassed by collection agencies.  But how can you tell the difference between aggressive collection tactics and outright harassment? If the collector is engaging in any of the following activities, then you may well be looking at harassment:  Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse anyone. For example, debt collectors may not:   use threats of violence or harm against the person, property, or reputation publish a list of consumers who refuse to pay their debts (except to a credit bureau) use obscene or profane language repeatedly use the telephone to annoy someone telephone people without identifying themselves advertise your debt  Debt collectors may not use any false statements when collecting a debt. For example, debt collectors may not:  falsely imply that they are attorneys or government representatives falsely imply that you have committed a crime falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit bureau misrepresent the amount of your debt misrepresent the involvement of an attorney in collecting a debt indicate that papers being sent to you are legal forms when they are not indicate that papers being sent to you are not legal forms when they are  Debt collectors also may not state that:  you will be arrested if you do not pay your debt they will seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property or wages, unless the collection agency or creditor intends to do so, and it is legal to do so actions, such as a lawsuit, will be taken against you, which legally may not be taken, or which they do not intend to take  Debt collectors are also not allowed to:  give false credit information about you to anyone send you anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency when it is not use a false name  Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, collectors may not:  collect any amount greater than your debt, unless allowed by law deposit a post-dated check prematurely make you accept collect calls or pay for telegrams take or threaten to take your property unless this can be done legally contact you by postcard  If you are being harassed by a collection agency, the normal reaction by most people is to either avoid the calls, or get angry with the collector. While getting angry with the harassing party might give you a brief moment of satisfaction, there are more productive ways to go about ridding yourself of that harassment.   Tell them to stop  Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you have the right to tell a collection agency employee to stop contacting you. Simply send a letter (registered mail) stating that you want the collection agency to cease all communications with you. All agency employees are then prohibited from contacting you, except to tell you that collection efforts have ended or that the collection agency or original creditor may sue you. You can do this even if the collector is not breaking the law.   Document the harassment  If a debt collector breaks the law, document the violation as soon as it happens. Start a log -- and write down what happened, when it happened and who witnessed it. Then, try to have another person present (or on the phone) during all future communications with the collector. In some states, you can record phone conversations without the debt collector's knowledge. But beware. In a few states this is illegal unless you get permission from the collector or warn him that you are recording the call. Check with your state consumer protection agency to find out if you live in one of these states.   File a Complaint  File an official complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the federal agency that oversees collection agencies. Ask the FTC to send you a complaint form, or just write a letter. Contact the Federal Trade Commission at:   6th and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20580  Or visit their website: http://www.ftc.gov/ftc/complaint.htm  Include the collection agency's name and address, the name of the collector, the dates and times of the conversations, and the names of any witnesses. Attach copies of all offending materials you received and a copy of any tape you made. Also, send a copy of your complaint to the state agency that regulates collection agencies for the state where the agency is located. To find the agency, call information in that state's capital city. Finally, send a copy to the original creditor and the collection agency. The original creditor may be concerned about its own liability and offer to cancel the debt.  Once your complaint is filed, don't expect immediate results. The FTC may take steps to sanction the agency if it has other complaints on record. The state agency may move more quickly to sue the collection agency or shut it down for certain violations. Your best hope is that the creditor will offer to cancel the debt.       Junior Investors: UGMA's     This investing stuff is so easy; a kid could do it!  ?and probably should.  If time is the most important factor in an investment program, than it's impossible to be too young to be an investor. Indeed, you should start an investment program as early as possible.   Starting an investment program is easy, regardless if you are a young adult (18 years or older) or a youngster. Once you reach the age of majority (18 in most states), you may have an investment account registered solely in your name. [IMAGE]  Youngsters under the age of 18 are not permitted to have their own investment accounts. However, several ways exist to introduce youngsters to investing.   When establishing investment accounts for youngsters, consider carefully how you want the account registered. If you choose to have the account in your own name, you will be responsible for taxes on the account. The good thing is that you also retain complete control over the account for as long as you want.  An alternative is to set up the account as a Uniform Gift To Minors Account (UGMA). Funds in the account are in the minor's name and social security number and are considered to be owned by the minor. Dividends paid on the account are taxable, most likely at a preferred tax rate. The adult custodian is responsible for the account until the minor reaches the age of majority. Any withdrawals from the account are payable to the custodian on the minor's behalf until that time. However, once the youth has reached the age of majority, which is 18 in most states, control of the account reverts to the child to do with as he or she sees fit. This is the downside of setting up a UGMA. Parental control is lost at the age of majority.  Another consideration is that college financial aid decisions could be impacted if a child has sizable assets in a UGMA.  For these reasons, it is important to understand the pros and cons of UGMAs before registering the investments in that manner.  There really is no right or wrong way to set up an investment account for a child. What may work for a friend may not work for you. For that reason, make sure you set up the account in the way that meets your, and your child's, objectives.             [IMAGE]           Index Funds: An overview    If you are new to the wild and wooly world of investing, then you are probably a bit overwhelmed by the number of different ""types"" of investments. From stocks to bonds, mutual funds and IRAs, it seems like you need a bachelor's degree in finance just to understand your options. In this article, we'll introduce you to Index Funds and explain why this might be an investment alternative worth looking into.   Unlike a typical mutual fund, index funds do not actively trade stocks throughout the year. This makes it an obvious choice for the investor that doesn't want to monitor the fund on a daily basis. Rather, the funds hold their stocks for the full year and even longer if the index incurs few changes. This helps to cut costs by reducing transaction fees and eliminating the need for highly paid fund managers.  There are a number of sound reasons why index funds are so popular with investors. A few of those are:  No Sales Charges. No Manager Risk. Less Volatility. Less Operating Costs. More Diversification. Less Capital Gains Tax. Higher Gross Returns for Both Bonds and Stocks. Even Higher Net Returns.  Not all indexes are created in the same way, though. How they are assembled can affect investor returns. Three methods primarily used to construct indexes are:  Market value-weighted Method- Each stock is given a weighting proportional to its market capitalization  Price Weighted Method- Each stock is given a weighting proportional to its market price  Equal Weighted Method- Each stock is equally weighted in the index   The market value-weighted method, where a company worth $2 Billion is given twice the weight of a company worth $1 Billion, is the most popular way of creating an index. A market value-weighted index allows investors to best capture total economic activity and changes in valuation of the companies in the index. By giving larger companies higher weighting, this method reflects the fact that large companies have larger revenues and profits and that any change will have a larger effect on economic activity than change in smaller companies.   A price-weighted index over-weights the performance of companies with higher listed stock prices. Early in this century, high prices were synonymous with larger companies and higher market caps. Things are different today but the old method is still used for computing the index.  An equally-weighted index makes no distinction between large and small companies, both of which are given equal weighting. The good performance of large-cap stocks is negated one-for-one by poor performance of smaller-cap stocks in this index. Since there are many more small companies than large ones, this strategy greatly overemphasizes the importance of small company activity.  Despite the fact that index funds tend to be much lower risk than other investment options, you should still speak with a financial advisor prior to making the purchase. He might be able to point out an index fund or two that have a higher yield potential.  And that is always a good thing!    Submit a story               [IMAGE]

I told Trav that we  would go over and play games with him last night, and I forgot about it ---  ooops. Anyway, Jonda is driving down from Pasadena tonight and wants to play. I  have to go, but I would like you to go to if you don't feel too tired. If you  want to get some rest though, I understand. Love you!  ---b.

Dear Jason Wolfe, 
It has been a while since we spoke about your driving needs. Our inventory has changed since then and I realize your needs may have changed as well.
We can still have the vehicle you originally were interested in within 24 hours and we also have some that are similar with similar equipment, only less expensive. Toyota has special financing rates available on Corollas, Tundras, 4Runners and 2001 Siennas. We have great deals on 2002 Camrys.
If youd like to revisit our inventory, please click here www.smccalltoyota.com 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hey Beth- 
This is pretty cool...I think that Kevin could probably stay on after the 
summer and work and finish up school.  I do not think that 
he has very many hours left. 
My apartment complex boilers were down this morning, so I had a cold 
shower.  Very unpleasant...but I turned the heat up to 88 in my apt. to 
compensate.  The pets looked at me like I was insane.

I printed out his resume and will take it to Earl this morning.  We 
probably have a place we can put him, but we need someone until the end of 
the year.  I will give it to Earl, though.

P.S.  Why would it print out backwards?

   Dearest Trav, 
   Saturday night was really special.  I've never had a five-way before, 
   and it was surprisingly comfortable.  Thanks for setting up that TV 
for 
   me to watch next to where the real action was going on.  Most guys 
   wouldn't have done that for me.  You're a wonderful guy, and I'll be 
   sure to invite you to all my upcoming multipartner fests. 
   Still sore, 
   Matt 
   PS. Please pass on my thanks and accolades to you're gorgeous 
   bikini-clad girlie and that hot dog.

   My Romantic Horoscope for Today: 
   The pieces of a two-piece puzzle just don't seem to want to fit 
   together. You've tried countless angles, jerry-riggings and creative 
   solutions, but you keep coming up short. Perhaps the answer, then, is to 
   work with the flaws between the pieces as well as the pieces themselves.

 Dear Beth and Allan,  I've really missed playing AoE with you guys, and 
then I failed to get my cross-cultural conquest on over the weekend, so 
I'm real withdrawal--even though I get bored of it after a week of solid 
play.  It would be so great if we got together tomorrow when Allan 
doesn't want to play Roge Spear and John wouldn't show up.  That would 
be like ... my dream.

PS. Allan, I suck at Rogue Spear.  At least in AoE, I get to suck as 
part of a cohesive, pan-national military short-bus.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant ""live"" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

"New Service Levels Coming Soon","Greetings from Citibank Bill Manager,

We recently emailed you regarding new service levels that would be available
for your selection on June 1, 2001 for Citibank Bill Manager. However, due

these new service levels will now be available beginning June 7, 2001.
We apologize for this delay.

When you visit Citibank Bill Manager for the first time on or after June 7,
2001, you will be asked to select one of the three available service levels.
***** If you do not select a service level by June 30, 2001, you will
automatically be placed in the Premium Plan. *****

Please keep in mind that the service level you select is effective for your

"Petition to the United Nations against subhuman treatment of wome	n in Afghanistan","
If you decide not to forward this,  please send it back 
to Darleene Barrientos [darleeneah@earthlink.net ]. This is  an actual 
petition, and ""signatures"" 
will be lost if you drop the  line. 
  
  
Please take 3 minutes out of  your life to do your 
part. And be sure to include other members of your  
household who are willing to sign. 
Petition to the United Nations  Background Information: 
Madhu, the government of  Afghanistan, is waging a war 
upon women. Since the Taliban took power in  1996, 
women have had to wear burqua and have been 
beaten and stoned in  public for not having the proper 
attire, even if this means simply not  having the mesh 
covering in front of their eyes. One woman 
was beaten  to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists 
for accidentally exposing her  arm(!) while she was 
driving. Another was stoned to death for 
trying  to leave the country with a man that was not a 
relative. 
Women are not allowed to work  or even go out in public 
without a male relative; professional women such  as 
professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists and 
writers have  been forced from their jobs and 
restricted to their homes. Homes where a  woman is 
present must have their windows painted so that she 
can never  be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent 
shoes so that they are never  heard. Women live in fear 
of their lives for the slightest misbehavior.  Because 
they cannot work, those without male 
relatives or husbands are  either starving to death or 
begging in the street, even if they hold  Ph.D.'s. 
Depression is becoming so widespread that it has 
reached  emergency 
levels. There is no way in such an extreme Islamic 
society  to know the suicide rate with certainty, but 
relief workers are estimating  that the suicide rate 
among women must be 
extraordinarily high: those  who cannot find proper 
medication and treatment for severe depression and  
would rather take their lives than live in such 
conditions. At one of  the rare hospitals for women, a 
reporter found still, nearly lifeless  bodies 
lying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in their 
burqua,  unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but 
slowly wasting away. Others  have gone mad and were 
seen crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or  
crying, most of them in fear. 
It is at the point where the  term ""human rights 
violations"" has become an understatement. Husbands  
have the power of life and death over their women 
relatives,  especially their wives, but an angry 
mob has just as much right to stone  or beat a woman, 
often to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or  
offending them in the slightest way. Women 
enjoyed relative freedom:  to work, to dress generally 
as they wanted, and to drive and appear in  public 
alone until only 1996. The rapidity of this 
transition is the  main reason for the depression and 
suicide; Women who were once educators  or doctors or 
simply used to basic human freedoms are now 
severely  restricted and treated as subhuman in the 
name of right-wing  fundamentalist Islam. It is not 
their tradition or 'culture', but it is  
alien to them, and it is extreme even for those 
cultures where  fundamentalism is the rule. Everyone 
has a right to a tolerable human  
existence, even if they are women in a Muslim country. 
If we can threaten military  force in Kosovo the name 
of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians,  
citizens of the world can certainly express 
peaceful outrage at the  oppression, murder and 
injustice committed against women by the Taliban.  
STATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current 
treatment of women in Afghanistan is completely  
UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the 
United Nations and that the  current situation overseas 
will not be tolerated. 
Women's Rights is not a small issue  anywhere, and it 
is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be treated as  
subhuman and as so much property. Equality 
and human decency is a  fundamental RIGHT, not a 
freedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan 
or elsewhere.

 Dear Beth and Allan,  I've really missed playing AoE with you guys, and 
then I failed to get my cross-cultural conquest on over the weekend, so 
I'm real withdrawal--even though I get bored of it after a week of solid 
play.  It would be so great if we got together tomorrow when Allan 
doesn't want to play Roge Spear and John wouldn't show up.  That would 
be like ... my dream.

part of a cohesive, pan-national military short-bus.

 Dear Beth and Allan,  I've really missed playing AoE with you guys, and 
then I failed to get my cross-cultural conquest on over the weekend, so 
I'm real withdrawal--even though I get bored of it after a week of solid 
play.  It would be so great if we got together tomorrow when Allan 
doesn't want to play Roge Spear and John wouldn't show up.  That would 
be like ... my dream. 
-Matt 
PS. Allan, I suck at Rogue Spear.  At least in AoE, I get to suck as 
part of a cohesive, pan-national military short-bus.

"On those really bad days","
If your job is not going well read this:  Nickolas Hall, expert in 
psychobiology gives an example of coping skills for job stress:  When 
you 
have an ""I hate my job day"" try this:  On your way home from work, stop 
at 
your pharmacy and go to the thermometer section. You will need to 
purchase 
a 
rectal thermometer 
made by Q-Tip. Be very sure that you get this brand. When you get home, 
lock 
your doors, draw the drapes and disconnect the phone so you will not be 
disturbed during your therapy. Change to very comfortable clothing, such 
as a 
sweat suit and lie down on your bed. Open the package and remove  the 
thermometer.  Carefully place it on the bedside table so that it will 
not 
become chipped or broken. Take out the written material that accompanies 
the 
thermometer and read it. You will notice that in small print there is a 
statement: 
Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is personally tested. Now, close 
your 
eyes and repeat out loud five times, ""I am so glad I  do  not work in 
quality 
control at the Q-tip Company.""  See...your job isn't really that bad 
after 
all...
