Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron stock sustains further heavy losses.

10/19/2001

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(New first paragraph, adds additional analyst comment) 
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock sustained further heavy losses on Friday as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite was rocked by reports about the company's relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer. 
The energy giant's stock closed down $2.95 or 10.2 percent at $26.05 per share, making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in over four years. 
Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 
""I don't think this thing passes the smell test,"" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think the CFO should be out of there right now. In the interest of the stockholders, that CFO should be gone,"" he said. 
Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. 
POOR JUDGMENT? 
Analysts said that at the very least, the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron, which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August. 
""For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors,"" said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. ""It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron,"" he said. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year, when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. 
The stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. 
This year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured, Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO, and the company's Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payments dispute. 
Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non-core businesses, including broadband and water services. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings. 
Analysts said Enron's credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead. 
""What don't we know that went on at that company? Where's the credibility?"" asked one frustrated analyst. ""We don't know if it's limited to this,"" he said.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A Beating
By Michael Rieke

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) hype and skyrocketing share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business.
Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom. 
The company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the third quarter of last year, the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 million. 
Enron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included severance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs, loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enron's content services. 
At an analysts meeting Oct. 16, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is ""not that robust"" right now. Industry revenue is low and there's substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market, ""more than even we anticipated,"" Lay said. 
The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners. 
""A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into,"" he said. ""Others thought so, too."" 
Looking back, Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital, Lay said. It spent ""too much too soon."" 
An Ominous Comparison 

He compared Enron's move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won't be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron. 
Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadband in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-lasting headache than broadband. 
Maybe Enron's surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers. 
It's trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year, he said. It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business. 
Meanwhile, the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in, he said. 
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs. 
At one time, they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard, Whalley said. Now they ""wouldn't want to forever be in the network business."" 
Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets. 
The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation. ""Intermediation"" is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses, said an Enron spokeswoman. It's a combination of trading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers. 
More Bad News Expected 

Rebecca Followill, a research analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter. 
""If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen, you've got to figure that their assets' values have fallen similarly,"" Followill told Bandwidth Beat. ""I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in broadband."" 
Another analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron. ""To the extent that they can take more writedowns, I think it would make eminently good sense to do it."" 
He predicted ""a $200 million haircut"" in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue. 
And that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broadband property, plant and equipment at the end of last year, he said. They had another $600 million of risk management asset receivables, inventories and working capital items. 
Followill doesn't see much future in broadband for Enron. 
""I think the business will shrink to the point where it won't be shown as a key sector in their reporting,"" she said. 
Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds, she said. Her investor clients don't expect broadband to contribute to Enron's earnings within the next three years. 
She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy. 
The other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. ""It doesn't look like there's any right now, to be honest,"" he said. ""They'll carry the trading operation to some degree.""

Dynegy Chief: Bandwidth Growth Won't Wait For Trading
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth sector has reached its bottom and is recovering. 
But those critics don't understand his bandwidth business, Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don't understand how the business world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said.
In announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday, Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event, be it of natural or human origin. That's what's driving the recovery, he said. 
Also, businesses will avoid travel, he said, relying instead on video conferencing. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn't seen any signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering, in part, because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with, he said. 
""They're trying to find trading partners for broadband,"" Watson said. ""That's going to be tough to do."" Dynegy isn't concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isn't ""a realistic model"" for it yet, he said. ""I said two years ago it was at least two years away. I still think it's probably at least two years away, before we actually call it a trading commodity."" 
The metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks, which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity, Watson said. 
It's unfortunate that Enron's model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market, Watson said. Dynegy's model includes telecom contracts, negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply of bandwidth. 
Dynegy's bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past several months, they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy's customers. The goal has been to build a customer base. ""We're looking at being an intermediary, and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today."" 
Since Dynegy lit its 16,000 route-mile network two weeks ago, the trading desk has been trying to fill the company's network instead of buying bandwidth from others. ""I'm trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements,"" Watson said. 
He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. ""They have offices that never talked to each before,"" he said. ""Now they've got to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable."" 
ChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy, said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids. 
The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications, the corporation's telecommunications unit, is $20 million to $25 million a quarter, Watson said. In the third quarter, it lost $15 million, down from $20 million in the second quarter. 
Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. 
""If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that's what we need really,"" he said. ""If we can get there by the end of next year, I'll be very happy. I think by '03, this market will have righted itself."" 
Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy. 
""Dynegy is an energy company,"" he said. ""Our energy merchant company is doing very well and business is growing like a weed...(Telecommunications) is not our core business by any stretch right now. But I'd love to be able to tell you it's going to be. I'd love to be able to tell you it is someday.""

UK: Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out.
By Amanda Cooper

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchange members' profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts. 
The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of high-profile companies to withdraw from the market, casting a pall over next week's yearly LME Week industry gathering in London.
Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks, raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work. 
""Good people can always be placed. As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire,"" Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment group Exchange Consulting said. 
""Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets, people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies."" 
Last week, ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member, unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor, prompting around 25 job losses among traders, phone jockeys and clerks. 
Then blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New York base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact, but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process. 
In the same week, the LME's largest floor trader, Enron Metals, said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group . 
SECURITY 
With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time, competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security. 
""What we're finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record, which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they're keen to stay put,"" Gilley said. 
""So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years, they are now staying for three to five years. 
""They probably feel that they're reasonably safe where they are, they're well recognised and not going to stick their necks out,"" she said. 
BONUS FEARS 
October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences 
Also, traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bonuses, which are usually announced at the end of the year. 
""Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of year, people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don't think any of them are anticipating good bonuses. They're probably just happy to have a job,"" Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said. 
LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi-tech and telecomms stocks. 
Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients, and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market. 
Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal. 
""A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it, "" Gilley said. 
""The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing,"" she added. 
As for morale in the industry, individuals' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed. 
""Just because I've lost my job doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Porsche,"" one trader said.

New Power Hldg Sees Meeting 3Q Loss Estimate

10/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Holding Inc. (NPW) expects to meet its prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement with Enron Corp. (ENE), lowering the collateral New Power must post under a master netting agreement. 
In a press release Friday, New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact and cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.
The company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. 
Analysts put the company's third quarter loss at $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Third quarter revenue will be ""slightly lower"" than the $60 million to $65 million forecast in August, New Power said. 

In the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.19 million. 
The amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the master cross-product netting, setoff, and security agreement, and expands through Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the Enron units. 
Under the amended pact, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. 
Shares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67, up 1 cent, or 0.6%, on early composite volume of 7,900 shares. Average daily volume is 223,800 shares.

I was trying to leave you alone through all this reporting nightmare, but Shankman said you are looking for a diversion so I'll set up a time with Liz.

FYI, in Chicago we currently have 3 employees and 12 contractors.  We are budgeted for a big increase in contractors in 2002, but in reality that will never happen.  If volumes actually demand that many customer service reps, we would outsource the first call response to a 3rd party call center, and keep Chicago for questions that couldn't be answered simply and for dispatch.  Also, we are working on technology which should increase the dispatcher efficiencies.  If volumes don't materialize, downsizing contractors is easy.  The budget has the contractors in it as a place holder for costs associated with transaction growth.  One way or the other, we will have to bear the marginal transactional costs.

On the space issue, we do have extra space available, but its really close to a free option.  We decided last spring to sub-lease out the webmodal space in Lombard and move to the Enron space downtown.  When we looked at all the support costs and the marginal cost of occupying the extra space downtown it was basically a wash.  The extra seats are there if we need them.

I'll explain more when we get together.

Dan

EPG:  Strong 3Q Results; Energy Merchant Business Leads the Way; Raise
Estimates

*	EPG reported strong 3Q operating EPS of $0.78 vs. $0.55, ahead of
our and consensus estimates of $0.73 and $0.74, respectively. 
*	Key Driver: Merchant Energy EBIT results remained strong, up 26%
year/year to $316 million.  Power and natural gas volumes were up 4% and
48%, respectively, consistent with the others who have reported. These
strong results demonstrate El Paso's ability to grow in all commodity price
environments. 
*	Production business also showed strong results, up 106% to $307
million, demonstrating the near-term success of El Paso's aggressive hedging
program. We remain somewhat cautious of El Paso's Production earnings in
2002, given SSB's reduced outlook for natural gas prices. We increase our
2002 EPS estimate to $3.60 to reflect the stronger hedging, but remain below
consensus due to SSB's view on future prices. 
*	We raise our 2001 EPS estimate to $3.35 and maintain 1H rating / $65
target.

AEP: Strong 3Q; Merchant Business Continues to Gain Traction

*	AEP reported 3Q:01 operating EPS of 1.43, up 13% from EPS of $1.27
reported in 3Q00.  YTD earnings were $3.00 vs. $2.23 in 2000. Excluding the
positive effect of Cook nuclear restart ($0.48), 9 mo. EPS are up 11%.
*	We feel that their recent growth in gas marketing activities has
moved AEP towards achieving the Scale & Scope necessary to succeed as an
Energy Merchant.
*	We are maintaining our 2001 estimate of $3.60, although it is at the
high end of the range of the company guidance. Our 2002 estimate of $3.80 is
at the low end of the range and reflects a likely weakening of the economy. 
*	Strong results appear to be helping separation plans gain momentum,
which we feel would be a catalyst for AEP shares.
*	We believe that AEP's growing strength as an Energy Merchant is not
reflected in its current share price and maintain our $55 target.

ENE--Downgrade to 3S from 1S; Credit Concerns Need To Be Addressed

*	Lower rating to 3S (Neutral, Speculative) from 1S (Buy, Speculative)
*	Enron is the industry dominant player in the energy merchant
industry; their business performance remains intact and should continue
unimpeded if current concerns over credit and liquidity are addressed.  We
believe this is the most likely outcome.
*	However, until management completely clarifies these issues,
particularly the use of off-balance sheet financing, we think growing credit
concerns could put increasing strain on Enron's commercial relationships.
Concern over a now higher probability ""worst-case"" outcome drives our 3S
rating.
*	Enron's shares represent a ""binary"" outcome to investors.  We see
low-end valuation of $10 (1x our estimate of book value based on known
off-balance sheet financings), with upside potential to $24 (2.4x bv).  The
expectation of near-term volatility in share price also justifies our
""Speculative"" risk rating.

This is just an early warning incase you get calls from business unit managers complaining about insurance premiums going up in the budget process. The intial estimates had been agreed last month and now we have to reopen the process to account for the WTC attack impact on the insurance markets. If you have any questions or if internal issues come to your attention, please contact me or Jim Bouillion. Per

Subject:	2002 Insurance Budget - RC 100226
Importance:	High

Last week's catastrophic event in New York and Washington D.C. has produced losses precipitating a further ""hardening"" of the worldwide insurance market resulting in higher rates, larger deductibles and retentions and more restrictive terms and conditions. The greatest impact has been to the property insurers with loss estimates in the billions. Liability insurers have seen a lesser impact in projected losses but rates are also expected to rise.

Our initial budget assumptions could not foresee this event. After consultation with our insurance market resources, we have deemed it necessary to increase our premium projections by an additional $9million for Property and $3million for Excess Liability. Enron's Worker's Compensation, Auto Liability, and General Liability are insulated from market fluctuations due to the use of our captive to fund these exposures.

Our budget only contemplates actual premiums. In the event the property deductible increases beyond the capabilities of the business units, we may be required to arrange a funding or other mechanism to manage the deductible. We are prepared to discuss this with you on an individual basis.

You will be receiving a revised budget from Corporate Financial Planning incorporating these increases. 

Please review and give me a call at x37904 should you wish to discuss further.

Regards,

Enron Replaces Fastow as Finance Chief --- McMahon Takes Over Post; Move Follows Concerns Over Partnership Deals

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major energy-trading companies. 
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, with annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billion, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's traded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operation, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in transactions.
""Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. ""There's not a trader out there that doesn't use EnronOnline."" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid. 
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar with the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement. 
Enron said Mr. Fastow ""will be on a leave of absence from the company."" He couldn't be reached for comment. 
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at nearly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-active stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stock. 
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier this year, the stock was above $80 a share. 
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies, which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, Dynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles. 
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could be seen as evidence that ""management does care"" about investor concerns. However, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming as it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as ""an admission of guilt."" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron largely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financial structure. 
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings. 
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible ""death spiral"" in which increasing credit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any evidence of such a problem. 
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities. Enron is facing a problem with ""trust and credibility. It's not easy to regain something as basic as trust,"" he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer. 
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night. 
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it. 
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions. 
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand. 
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address. 
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either in cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate. 
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75. 
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said. 
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours trading, they fell to $16.14. 
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell'' from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Monday. 
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yesterday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.'' 
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People could fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get any answers.''

Enron replaced Andrew Fastow as its chief financial officer, a day after chief executive Kenneth Lay stressed the company's confidence in Fastow, who performed dual roles as the energy giant's CFO while managing partnerships with which Enron did business. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Lay said in a statement. The partnerships have been dissolved.

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-based Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal securities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investment partnerships that he ran. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow had been put on a ""leave of absence"" for an undetermined period and named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The company said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares. 
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quarter earnings on Oct 16. 
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enron's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment. 
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron, served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments. 
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time. 
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also ended its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enron took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a ""Chinese wall"" existed between Enron and LJM. 
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer before moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up the company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortable with the Fastow-LJM setup. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available for comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving a salary. 
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an ""informal inquiry"" into the LJM dealings. 
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling in August for personal reasons. 
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followed the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry. 
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations. 
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partnerships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities. 
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business. 
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38. 
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, which closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets. 
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with analysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped. 
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, moved from a ""hold"" to a ""sell"" rating.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price. 
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off. 
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the partnerships established with Mr Fastow. 
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earlier served as Enron's treasurer. 
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough. Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demonstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called for Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those calls. 
Ms Coale issued a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. ""We are concerned about what we don't know,"" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure. 
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - 'Sell' note issued on Enron shares.
By SHEILA MCNULTY.

Financial Times (U.K. edition)

Shares in Enron, the US energy group, fell again yesterday after Prudential Securities issued a ""sell"" note on concerns that the $1.2bn loss taken by the company last week might not be the end of its bad news. 
In the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading, Enron's stock was the biggest percentage loser, dropping 20.2 per cent to $15.80 - its lowest level since August 1995. /
""We are concerned about what we don't know,"" said Carol Coale, the Prudential analyst who covers Enron. 
She was disappointed that Enron had not been more forthcoming in the conference call it held on Tuesday in response to charges it was not being transparent. 
Investors have been abandoning the stock since October 16, when Enron told analysts it was taking a $1.2bn loss in shutting down funding mechanisms it had set up in controversial partnerships established with Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer. 
This charge has not been thoroughly explained, leading to confusion among analysts and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Ms Coale said she was concerned Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. She said Enron might lose customers to competitors that are not under such pressure. 
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and that the SEC enquiry will prove that the company has done nothing wrong.

Enron 
To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chief financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in its third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1.2bn equity charge related to the closing of ""related party transactions"" with two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention that the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest anyone? 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. Investors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so after its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposite effect. 
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes receivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. The uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack of disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlikely to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for shareholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief executive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problem goes beyond one individual.

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America
2001-10-25 08:49 (New York)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US)
was downgraded to ``market perform'' from ``strong buy'' by analyst William J
Maze at Banc of America.


Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list investors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the company stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. 
""It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC,"" Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. ""Who knows?""
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Monday's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by Fastow. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed Wednesday. 
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, who has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets group, takes over his role. 
""I think change is good at this particular point in time,"" said FAC Equities analyst Robert Christensen said. ""I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."" 
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships. 
""I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,"" Heim said. 
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added. 
""There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community,"" Heim said. ""Instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever."" 
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 per share, a 17 percent decline. 
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week, Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent. 
""The market was asking for that to happen,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said of Fastow's departure. ""This is really the first time Enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."" 
Previously, Enron's managers have been ""cautious and defensive in their approach,"" he said. 
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have since been dissolved. 
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim. 
""I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever expect to take any more charges,"" Heim said. ""What I heard is we don't have to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."" 
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third quarter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's future, Heim said. 
""It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now, two years from now,"" he said. 
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, Feygin said. 
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer. 
""Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the partnerships),"" Feygin said. ""Three days ago I would have said there is no need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was something Enron needed to do.""

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble. 
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conference call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasurer Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. The stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion of shareholder wealth. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said. 
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, resulting from US$1.01-billion in write-offs. 
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow. 
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently looking into the partnership arrangement. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors. 
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this week, to ""sell"" from ""hold."" Ms. Coale said the rating change is ""not because of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't know about the company."" 
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average daily volume is 6.7 million shares. 
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's line during the conference call. 
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder equity. But Mr. Feygin said management was ""defensive"" when pressed for details. 
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad news was to come. 
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the company's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term fortunes. 
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's lowered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

Enron replaces CFO Fastow in wake of LJM probe; appoints McMahon

AFX News

HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it named Jeff McMahon chief financial officer in place of Andrew Fastow. 
Announcing McMahon's appointment, Chairman Kenneth Lay said: ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO.""
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two LJM partnerships run by Fastow, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. 
The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter as saying McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships. 
Internal documents indicate Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships, the newspaper reported.

Enron Corp. ousted Andrew Fastow as its chief financial officer Wednesday, a day after Chief Executive Kenneth Lay stressed the company's confidence in him despite growing controversy over Fastow's role overseeing partnerships that did business with the energy- trading giant. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Lay said in a statement..
The company said Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeff McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer. 
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, after Enron's third-quarter earnings release failed to disclose the partnerships.

Enron Ousts CFO Amid SEC Probe

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader $35 million. 
Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets group, as CFO because ""it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said.
Fastow will take a leave of absence. 
Shares of Enron, based in Houston, have plunged 80% this year. Third-quarter charges of $1.01 billion from failed investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped out 70% of the profit earned in the last four quarters. 
""Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to Andy,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded Enron to ""long-term buy"" and owns no shares. 
Fastow, 39, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million in third-quarter losses. 
Enron also bought back 62 million shares from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment. 
During a conference call Tuesday, Lay said, ""I and Enron's board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as CFO."" 
Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock closed down $3.38, or 17%, to $16.41 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, setting a new 52-week low. 
The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday. Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received. 
The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office indicate.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with Andrew Fastow. 
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the executive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this deal, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54% in just seven days. 
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group. 
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to show that the ""Fastow era"" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2. 
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct. 
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company? 
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence. 
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board. 
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed the LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders. 
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency. 
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management? 


Phew! Enron Stinks

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it create a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoarding it, perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled? Did we wipe out billions in equity of utilities in some sort of bizarre zero-sum game in which Enron won it all and shareholders from California utilities lost? 
And was Enron at the hub of a vast power conspiracy to screw the U.S. consumer? 
Somehow, I believe that if it weren't for the events of Sept. 11 and its aftermath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department antitrust division or a Congressional investigation. To me, this one smells worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time. 
And we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to the bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history. 
We ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treble damages that violators owe. 
What surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want to make his name blowing this one wide open. 
This nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abandon the white-collar folks, either. 
There was just too much money lost too fast for what, in an era where energy seems pretty plentiful, couldn't possibly, in retrospect, be considered a real shortage.

For a while, in fact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues and blue chips, although there were moments when these stocks, too, slipped into negative territory. ?The day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and investors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not. ?Generally for small caps, ""It's `where do we go from here' time,"" said Andrew Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot of small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market reopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons to be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. ""Now, it seems the whole market is looking for direction."" ?On the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, with 1.321 billion advancing and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced decliners by 1,902 to 1,628. ?It was tech all the way among the day's top performers. ?Communications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and networking firms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.2%, to 23.97, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Networks added 93 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17. ?Semiconductors were the session's second-best presenters with, among small caps, Elantec Semiconductor adding 3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.80. ?Wireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-cap Nextel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after posting a third-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued firmness in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps, AirGate PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78. ?The day's poorest performers were natural-gas utilities, which continued to be dragged down by large cap Enron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedmont Natural Gas fell 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 30.63, and Peoples Energy shed 56 cents, or 1.4%, to 39.06. ?Pegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Cambridge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even stronger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estimate by 10 cents a share. ?Pinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. The Mountain View, Calif., video-production-system maker had a fiscal first-quarter loss of 11 cents a share before items, beating Wall Street expectations by eight cents a share. Thomas Weisel upgraded shares to `buy' from `market perform.' ?Sybase jumped 1.99, or 17%, to 13.50. The Emeryville, Calif., online-software developer reported 20 cents a share in earnings before items, beating Wall Street's expectations by two cents a share. ?In a follow-on offering, AmeriPath gained 2.24, or 8.4%, to 29.04 after offering 4.125 million shares at $26 each. The follow-on, as is the custom, was priced at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80. ?Merger activity had a positive effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3.38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Billerica, Mass., semiconductor-equipment maker signed a definitive agreement to be bought by Brooks Automation for about $380 million in stock. Under the accord, which was approved by both companies' boards, PRI shareholders will receive 0.52 Brooks share for each PRI share held. Brooks Automation fell 1.31, 3.9%, to 31.80. ?Vysis surged 7.26, or 31%, to 30.26. The Downers Grove, Ill., genetic-disease researcher agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $30.50 a share, or $355 million. Abbott rose 38 cents to 54.24. ?ONI Systems dropped 1.01, or 15%, to 5.62. The San Jose, Calif., maker of fiber-optic communication equipment met analysts' third-quarter consensus estimate of 19 cents a share, excluding items, but said its fourth-quarter loss will range between 16 cents and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $40 million to $50 million, when analysts were expecting a loss of 16 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $50.1 million.

All Rights Reserved.??WASHINGTON - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's co-founder said yesterday. ?In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.?""It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,"" said Ms. Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. ?Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. ?Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. ?Ms. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. ?Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. ?""There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,"" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. ?The corporate governance movement, since its beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. ?One example would be Enron Corp., whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow said. ?""Where was the Enron board in all of this?"" she asked. ""Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here."" ?Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. ?""This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,"" she said. ?Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. ?""Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,"" said Peter Gleason, vice-president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. ?Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. ""More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,"" Mr. Gleason said.??Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. ?Fastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues because of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against the company. ?As recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a corporate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money machine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodities. ?But some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an Indian power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation. ?There also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements had become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. ?Analysts said the replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but not a panacea for its credibility problems. ?""The problems investors are having with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnership arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those concerns,"" said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. ?""I don't think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these partnerships,"" he said. ""I still have a lot of questions."" ?Andre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not that helpful. ?""Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that clears up the picture,"" he said.

All Rights Reserved. 	??USA: Utility stocks drop on slipping expectations.?By Jim Brumm??10/24/2001?Reuters English News Service?(C) Reuters Limited 2001.??NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Slipping expectations of 2002 power profits combined with Enron Corp.'s growing problems helped drag utility stock prices to their lowest levels this month on Wednesday. ?While the general market closed higher, the S&P Utilities Index ended the day with a loss of 8.99, or 3.55 percent, to 244.32.?The big loser, as it has been in many recent sessions, was Enron, which traded at the lowest price since February 1995 before steadying a bit to close at $16.41 - down 17.08 percent, or $3.38, for the day and 44 percent from its price two weeks ago - as analysts recommended selling the stock. ?Prudential's Carol Coale said the sell recommendation was not made ""because of things that we know, but because of things we potentially do not know. ?After the close Enron said it named former treasurer Jeff McMahon to replace Andrew Fastow as chief financial officer, and quoted chief executive officer Kenneth Lay as saying ""it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" ?Close behind Enron on the biggest loser lists Wednesday were companies that had patterned themselves after the power trading giant. Closest was Dynegy Inc. which closed with a loss of $5.45, or 12.76 percent, at $37.26 - its lowest price in three weeks. ?POWER EARNINGS FORECASTS TRIMMED ?The talk of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and trading came from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - American Electric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. and PPL Corp. . ?Early Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, change in earnings per share next year from this year, citing expectations of lower profits on power sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The company also confirmed it still sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share. ?Noting PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia Securities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to ""market perform"" from ""strong buy"" explaining PPL's ""failure to differentiate itself from the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility. ?""The company will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to be afforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks,"" he concluded. ?Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar downgrades in Exelon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectations. ?STOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES ?""The primary driver (for the 2002 estimate) is lower wholesale commodity price assumptions at (the company's generation unit), in addition to weaker distribution demand"" at Exelon's utility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chicago, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday. ?Exelon officials noted, in answer to analyst questions, that the view of 2002 demand had changed to negative from flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. ?The company's stock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the earnings release early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares continued to advance Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers among the 40 S&P Utility Index components. ?The big loser among the integrated utilities - those which produce and distribute power - was PPL, which ended the day at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 percent. ?Losses of about 1.3 percent were posted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, which slipped 52 cents to $39.48. ?AEP ""management cautioned that the slowing economy may make the upper end (of its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to $3.90) more difficult to achieve,"" Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrote in a note that maintained his estimate. ?He lowered his estimate of PSEG 2002 earnings per share 5 cents to $4.05 while awaiting the closing of a Peruvian purchase and pointed out it receives more for electricity than most PJM power producers because of restraints on the delivery of Midwest electricity to New Jersey's power hungry markets.??Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE) and its principal officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through and including October 18, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). ?The complaint alleges that Enron and its principal officers and directors violated Section 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of l934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaint alleges that defendants misled investors (1) by reporting assets that were overvalued by more than $1 billion, which caused writedowns in that amount and are expected to lead to further writeoffs of hundreds of millions of dollars, (2) by concealing facts regarding relationships with a related entity that led to a more than $1 billion reduction of shareholders' equity and a $35 million charge, and (3) by obfuscating or failing to disclose the fact that agreements with other related entities satisfaction of which include obligations that may require the Company to issue large amounts of its shares. This misconduct caused the market prices of Enron stock to be artificially inflated during the Class Period. When facts about these matters were disclosed at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Company's per share stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the Company's stock despite the precurietous fall in its market price. Also, Enron's senior debt was placed on notice by Moody's for possible downgrade.?Also, an SEC inquiry into the Company's transactions with related entities has been announced, and the Company revealed that its Chief Financial Officer, who is one of the Defendants, has taken a ""leave of absence"" from the Company, and has been replaced. ?If you purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through October 18, 2001, inclusive, you may, no later than December 21, 2001 move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff.

Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. executives?profited from inside knowledge when they sold $73 million in?shares ahead of a 26 percent drop in the energy trading company's?stock in February and March, a shareholder alleges in a lawsuit.??     The allegations of insider trading were filed today as an?amendment to an earlier lawsuit filed by shareholder Fred?Greenberg.??     The original lawsuit, filed on Oct. 17 in Houston, accuses?Enron's board of costing the company at least $35 million through?dealings with two partnerships run by former Chief Financial?officer Andrew Fastow.??     In the amendment filed today, the suit accuses Fastow of?using insider knowledge that Enron's stock was going to drop to?prevent losses at one of the partnerships, LJM2.??     The partnership was committed to buying Enron stock at?predetermined price in September 2000, the complaint says. Enron?agreed to renegotiate the terms of the transaction to let LJM2 buy?the shares two months early.??    That let the partnership earn a $10.5 million in profit, the?suit says. If the transaction had not been renegotiated, the?partnership would have lost $8 for every share it sold in?September, the suit alleges.??                           `Bailed Out'??     ``Mr. Fastow and LJM2 took advantage of inside information to?reap illicit insider trading profits, in the millions of dollars?in this transaction alone,'' the suit says.??     At the same time that the LJM2 transaction was being?renegotiated in December and January, Chief Executive Officer?Kenneth Lay, President Mark Frevert and other top managers sold?the $73 million in shares, the suit alleges.??     Enron executives ``bailed out of shares... reaping huge?insider trading profits,'' the lawsuit says.??     Other sellers included former CEO Jeff Skilling, Chief?Strategy Officer Cliff Baxter, broadband services CEO Ken Rice,?Chief of Staff Steve Kean, pipeline group CEO Stanley Horton and?Chief Risk Officer Richard Buy, the suit says.??     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the?lawsuit.??     ``We haven't been served (notice of the suit), and it's our?policy not to talk about pending litigation,'' she said??     In March, spokesman Mark Palmer said the executives exercised?stock options that would have expired worthless otherwise.??     Enron has formed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and?sell company assets, according to records from the Texas secretary?of state. The Houston-based company reported $1.01 billion in?third-quarter losses, including $35 million from the LJM?partnerships run by Fastow.??                            SEC Inquiry??

(Adds description of Enron Net Works in sixth paragraph.)??     Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief?Financial Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange?Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest?energy trader $35 million.??     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets?group, as CFO because ``it became clear to me that restoring?investor confidence would require us to replace Andy,'' Chairman?and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.?Fastow will take a leave of absence.??     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, have fallen 80 percent?this year. Third-quarter losses of $1.01 billion from failed?investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped?out 70 percent of the profit earned in the past four quarters.??     ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to?Andy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded?Enron to ``long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.??     As Enron treasurer, McMahon complained to then-Enron?President Jeffrey Skilling about potential conflicts of interest?posed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street Journal?reported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the?Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.??     ``McMahon was made famous under Skilling by going to him and?objecting to the partnerships,'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was?transferred out of the treasurer function into Enron Net Works,''?which oversees Enron's Internet trading system.??                       `An Outstanding Job'??     Fastow, 39 years old, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,?two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's?involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million?in third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares?from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.??     On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's?board of directors continue to have the highest faith and?confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as?CFO.''??      Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock?closed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in today's trading.??      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday.?Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron?is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.??     The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships?and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as?power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office?indicate.??     The Texas records list dozens of Enron executives as officers?and directors of company-related partnerships. None of them have?any financial interest in the partnerships after Fastow severed?ties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.??                        `Zero Compensation'??     ``The managers in these affiliates listed as managing members?are representational in nature only,'' he said. ``They get zero?compensation.''??     The LJM partnerships were different. Enron's board allowed?Fastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years, to run them?and earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested,?the Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a?shareholder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships?reworked an agreement with Enron to avoid taking big losses.??     Enron is obligated to repay $3.3 billion associated with two?other partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, if they can't raise?enough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, Enron?spokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when?asked if the partnerships will generate enough cash.??     ``The concern now isn't just with the LJM partnership, it's?more with the other partnerships, such as Osprey and Marlin,''?said A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a ``hold'' rating on?Enron and owns no shares.??                       High Level Departures??     Enron has lost several senior executives in the past two?years. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the?job, citing personal reasons and frustration with declines in the?company's stock price. Enron Corp. Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton?left the company in November as the company switched its focus?from developing assets to energy and commodity trading.??     Rebecca Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S.?business, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of?Azurix Corp., a water company formed by Enron Corp. Mark also?resigned from Enron's board.??     Azurix was a money-losing investment. Enron sold shares in?the water company to the public that it later had to buy back.??--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651??

Coralina, you'll recall that all of the above companies were set up to be part of the Power Plant/Regasification facility JV with Union Fenosa.  That has died, and these companies are now considered ""shelf"" companies, with no business and no purpose; however, we cannot keep them as such, since they are costly, I'd like to dissolve them before year-end.

Would you kindly send me a return message with your approval to proceed with dissolving all of the above entities.  I of course will send an annoucement memo company-wide (""Notice of Intent to Dissolve"") to give those involved a chance to review and respond back if there is any reason NOT to dissolve them.  I do have one group wanting Enron Dominicana B.V.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Budget Update","FYI on budgets.
 
We almost have the total IT depreciation pulled together.
 
The systems development budget is moving down since our meeting.  We are meeting heavily with operations and the business unit heads or their designees to get those numbers down to what is necessary for 2002.
 
Got some agreement on headcount analysis form Wes today and will confirm with all other business units tomorrow so Jenny's budget will be accurate and the projected 2002 headcount accurate as well.
 
Richter is in tough spot trying to roll out the EOL pricing methodology to EA, EGM, EEL and EIM but he is doing the best he can.  The good news is that you know the total and they agree with the total.
 
Operations is almost agreed to.  Most business unit heads are close to their operations person (Bbo Hall, Brent Price, Kevin Sweeney, Beth Apollo) so they trust their budget recommendations.
 
Final complaint is, as expected, indirects but we are trying to get to yes on that.
 
When this is better in a few days, I will e-mail you a new sheet like the one we showed you that has new expenses, new capital and the TOTAL IT depreciation number.
 
Thanks.

Enron CFO's Partnership Had Millions in Profit
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document. 
The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.
Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investors in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicates the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction early. 
The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders and analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putting the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wachovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuous time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming the nation's biggest energy-trading company. 
This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured business initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on investments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million, was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That termination also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as the company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM2 deals. 
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 a share. 
Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at helping hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding sources of capital. 
Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In late July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareholders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe his relation to LJM2. 
In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of return at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a decline in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related energy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals. 
In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in ""Raptor III,"" which involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a set price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron to settle the investment early, ""causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million capital invested plus $10.5 million in profit,"" the report said. The renegotiation was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced LJM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indicated.

Enron CFO Profited From Partnerships With Company, WSJ Reports
2001-10-19 01:00 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow realized profits through a limited
partnership that did business with Enron, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an internal partnership document.

     LJM2 Co-Investment LP, of which Fastow is a general partner,
made millions of dollars on transactions with Enron, the paper
said. Fastow and possibly a handful of partnership associates made
$7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in
capital increases on an investment of about $3 million in the
partnership, the paper said.

     Enron shareholder Fred Greenberg filed a lawsuit yesterday,
alleging that Enron's board cost the company at least $35 million
by allowing Fastow to manage partnerships that bought Enron
assets. Enron reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from
failed investments.

1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?
One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - news - commentary) , the German chemical maker, which has seen its share price gain 10.4% since the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the stock might be getting ahead of themselves. 
Bayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand for Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of the company's overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year (and, according to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its acquisition of Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put the demand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S. sales of the drug to be approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001. 
Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably won't add that much to Bayer's overall revenues. The president has asked for $643 million for antibiotics to combat bioterrorist attacks. While it's possible that sum will be increased, not all the money would be spent on Cipro. 
Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Cipro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some pressure in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other manufacturers. 
On another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit related to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It was forced to withdraw the drug from the market. 
Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's a refuge for investors. 
2. Losses at Twice the Price
You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double the price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , the supply-chain software maker. After market close on Tuesday, the company posted losses under generally accepted accounting principles that amounted to $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for the latest quarter, including all charges. 
In other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share price, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement. 
Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of Aspect Development in March 2000. 
To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2 typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordinary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so bad: The company met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3 million, or 13 cents per share. 
Still, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock down 25% the day after they were reported. 
3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks
In times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as usual at many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a competitor. 
It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the words ""Microsoft Server Crunch"" to customers of rival server software maker Novell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained ""a number of false and misleading statements"" intended as putdowns of Novell products. 
Among the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged food. For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a line on the Microsoft boxes read: ""What's the expiration date on that NetWare platform?"" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly funny engineers.) 
The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consulting services, which Novell says isn't true. 
Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intended to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. ""It was all in the theme of a mock cereal box,"" he said. ""It was a modest campaign."" 
In response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter in September to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements, and it's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For the record, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money damages. 
4. AMD's Feisty Pledge
CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be too much to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical rough edges cross the line into embarrassing. 
Case in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which earlier this week reported a loss for the first time in almost three years. The company, facing harsh pricing competition from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , said its revenue was down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for the fourth quarter. 
Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to be extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference call, he indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called ""Hammer"" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, ""We feel that when the upturn comes, we're going to kick ---."" 
Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders, meet Mr. Reeves. 
OK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But his comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will look better when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime soon, what matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges notwithstanding. 
5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style
Analysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produced results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they came from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gotten even more unsettling. 
To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted a steep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop that its shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion. 
In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to the ""removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares."" According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased 55 million shares issued through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital, a partnership that until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO. 
TSC's Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy Enron stock. 
Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it had expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet its accounting critics. 
Enron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify exactly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest revelation, to say the least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility. Enron, whose CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, had seen its stock fall 59% for the year leading up to its latest earnings release. Since then, it's dropped another 12.6% 


The New Power Company Revises Its Netting Agreement With Enron; Provides For Receivables and Inventory Financing

10/19/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The New Power Company (""NewPower""), a wholly owned subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NPW) today filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting that it has revised its master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (together, the ""Enron Subsidiaries""). 
The amendment affects the Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement (the ""Master Netting Agreement"") among NewPower and the Enron Subsidiaries, and expands through January 4, 2002, the types of collateral that NewPower is permitted to post to the Enron Subsidiaries.
The effect of the amendment is to reduce, through January 4, 2002, the amount of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron Subsidiaries. Under the amended Master Netting Agreement, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of NewPower, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Pledging receivables and inventory is consistent with NewPower's previously announced intention to secure asset-backed financing. 
With the amendment and NewPower's cost reduction efforts, and absent a similar rate of decline in commodity prices or other significant events, NewPower believes that it has sufficient financial resources to conduct its business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing, which will be necessary upon the expiration of the amendment. NewPower has been and is actively seeking to arrange asset-backed financing with other parties, although to date no such arrangements have been secured. 
The Company expects to meet its previous estimate of net loss and loss per basic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2001. However, customer count and revenues are expected to be slightly lower than previously forecast. 
The Company will provide revised guidance for the fourth quarter 2001 and an outlook for 2002 on its third quarter conference call scheduled for Thursday, November 8.

LOBBYING
K Street's Top 10: The Shifting Lineup
Shawn Zeller

10/20/2001
National Journal
Copyright 2001 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.

How do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselves in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners? Van Scoyoc Associates Inc. does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to retain them. Quinn Gillespie & Associates doesn't have a long client list, but it is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client. Greenberg Traurig, meanwhile, lured away a rival firm's top rainmaker-and his lucrative book of clients. 
These are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal's survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income from January 1 to June 30. The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same ones as a year earlier: perennial powerhouses Cassidy & Associates Inc.; Patton Boggs; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand.
But two new players-boasting huge growth rates-are among the firms nipping at the heels of these top dogs. 
Greenberg Traurig, which came in at No. 5 in National Journal's midyear 2001 rankings, had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying firms. According to PoliticalMoneyLine, which compiles a comprehensive annual list of all lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig had the 35th-highest income during the first six months of last year. 
And No. 7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie, another first-time member of the top 10. Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinton White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie-a one-time adviser to House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas-the firm has seen its fortunes rocket upward. Quinn Gillespie was No. 13 in the first six months of 2000. 
In between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates, ranked at No. 6. There has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc, which was No. 28 in fee income at the end of 1996, the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act first took effect. 
Rounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams & Jensen; Washington Council Ernst & Young; and Barbour Griffith & Rogers. 
National Journal ranks the top-10 lobbying firms every six months by tallying the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the 1995 legislation. National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 top firms in PoliticalMoneyLine's comprehensive annual survey. 
With its $16.68 million in fees for the first six months of the year, Cassidy & Associates continued to blow away the competition. The last time any firm reported a six-month total larger than Cassidy's was during the first half of 1998, when Verner, Liipfert led the way. During the first six months of this year, Cassidy & Associates received a massive fee of $1 million from the Taiwan Studies Institute, a think tank with close ties to the Taiwanese government; Boeing Co. paid Cassidy & Associates $600,000; and Tiffany & Co. paid it $400,000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mined in conflict-ridden areas of the world from entering the global market. 
Despite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat, lobbying goes on, company Chairman Gerald S.J. Cassidy said. ""During difficult times, people come to Washington with their problems. During more-robust times, they come seeking opportunities."" 
But the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig. The firm, which posted just $1.71 million in lobbying fees during the first half of 2000, saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly $8.7 million this year. Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff, the conservative K Street mover and shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Last year, Abramoff left his old firm, Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, and brought $3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig. Preston Gates, which was ranked in the top five during Abramoff's tenure, dropped out of National Journal's rankings this year. The lobbying firm's fees fell by nearly 50 percent. 
Abramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig, billing $860,000 to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, $500,000 to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and $300,000 to garment manufacturers that operate in that U.S. territory. A few new clients also forked over big bucks: the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana ($440,000); Voor Huisen Project Management, a homebuilder with international operations ($300,000); and the American International Center ($100,000). Despite initial concerns among some Greenberg Traurig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in, Abramoff insists that his team of lobbyists has been ""totally integrated"" into the firm. 
But Abramoff wasn't the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig's higher earnings. Ronald W. Kleinman, a former State Department lawyer, persuaded Congress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Section 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. This section of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban government funds that are frozen in U.S. banks to compensate the families of three men who had won multimillion-dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amendment to the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act. The amendment allows victims of terrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. 
Greenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre, Carlos Alberto Costa, and Mario M. de la Pena-three members of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban-American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida. The three men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on February 24, 1996. The families sued Cuba and were awarded $96.7 million in damages by a U.S. District Court judge in 1997. The State Department opposed payment, but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill. Greenberg Traurig reported a fee of $4 million. 
Fred W. Baggett, the chair of Greenberg Traurig's governmental practice group, said this was a one-time fee, but he added that the Cuban case ""established a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one-time efforts in the future,"" and noted, ""We have a few coming down the pipeline."" 
Baggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem by the Palestinian group Hamas, and Americans who were used as human shields in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. None of the Americans was killed, and all were eventually released. 
Taking the flip side of the mega-fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates, which reported receiving no fee above $180,000. Nonetheless, the firm continued its steady rise. A key reason, said firm President H. Stewart Van Scoyoc, was the ability to recruit and retain clients. The firm signed up 34 clients between January 1 and June 30, while only nine out of 159 clients terminated contracts during the period. 
""We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a contract,"" said Van Scoyoc. ""We make sure we're clear on the goals and objectives, and in a typical relationship, we don't guarantee that we can do everything."" The firm's $6.24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23 percent higher than its fees for the same period last year. 
Quinn Gillespie's ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenberg Traurig's. Quinn Gillespie's billings were almost $6.09 million at midyear 2001, a 71 percent rise over the same period last year. The firm has only 34 paying clients, but the average fee per client-$180,000-is the highest among the top 10. During the six months, the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council paid a fee of $540,000 to Quinn Gillespie, while Enron Corp. paid $525,000. The Canadian group hoped its high-powered lobbyists would win greater access for Canadian lumber in the United States, but U.S. tariffs were reinstated earlier this year. Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregulation, particularly in California. Enron is a major creditor of Southern California Edison, the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shortages in California last summer. 
Quinn Gillespie's staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to nearly 30 today. ""We like to think we have a toolbox here-people who may be Republicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit the client,"" Quinn said. 
Patton Boggs had fees of $10.26 million in the first six months of 2001, but that was just a 5 percent rise over the same period in 2000. Still, the firm leapfrogged over Verner, Liipfert to capture the No. 2 ranking. Patton Boggs earned $360,000 from Russia's government-owned NTV television network, which was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when the government took over the independent network and ousted its staff. 
Akin, Gump also jumped past Verner, Liipfert to No. 3 in the rankings, posting $9.48 million in fees-a 16 percent increase over a year earlier. Akin, Gump's biggest client was the troubled tire manufacturer Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., which paid just over $1.5 million in fees. Akin, Gump also earned big money from AT&T ($800,000) and the Gila River Indian Community ($620,000). 
At No. 4, Verner, Liipfert saw the biggest drop in fees, taking in $8.84 million in the first six months of 2001-down 16 percent from the same period in 2000. Verner, Liipfert lost lucrative contracts with Puerto Rico after the government there changed hands last year. (See this issue, p. 3273.) 
Rounding out the top-10 rankings, Williams & Jensen at No. 8 billed $5.68 million, a 12 percent increase over the first half of 2000, while Washington Council Ernst & Young saw its fees drop 11 percent to $5.5 million. The firm fell four places to No. 9 in the rankings. Barbour Griffith & Rogers's fee income was up 7 percent to $5.48 million, putting the firm at No. 10. 
Falling out of the midyear top-10 rankings were Preston Gates-No. 6 at midyear 2000-and PricewaterhouseCoopers, No. 7 last year. PricewaterhouseCoopers's billings were $5 million for the period, a 6 percent drop from the first half of 2000.

Houston Chronicle
Houston entrepreneurs added to Texas Business Hall of Fame 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Texas Business Hall of Fame's annual awards ceremony Thursday night honored four Houston business leaders. 
The event at the George R. Brown Convention Center put the spotlight on Weingarten Realty Investors Chairman Stanford Alexander; Compaq Computer founder and former Chief Executive Officer Rod Canion; retired Reliant Energy Chairman and CEO Don Jordan; and Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson. 
This is the 19th year the nonprofit Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation has honored the state's business leaders with a dinner and induction event. 
As chairman of Weingarten Realty Investors, Stanford Alexander built the company into one of the nation's largest publicly traded real estate companies. 
After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Alexander joined J. Weingarten, a Houston-based chain of 87 supermarkets. He later became an executive with Weingarten Markets Realty Co., an affiliated real estate firm that developed free-standing supermarket stores. 
The firm later changed its name to Weingarten Realty. The Houston-based company is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Weingarten owns shopping centers, warehouses and other property in 17 states from coast to coast. 
Weingarten's notable developments in Houston include the upscale Village Arcade near Rice University and the Centre at Post Oak, across from the Galleria. 
Rod Canion came up with the idea behind Compaq in 1982 after a trip to a local ComputerLand store. Along with colleagues from Texas Instruments, Jim Harris and industrial designer Ted Papajohn, Canion envisioned a portable computer that ran all the programs that operated on the IBM PC. 
By the next year, the company was producing the original Compaq luggable computer, a move that essentially created the modern PC industry. By 1987, its fifth year, the company made business history by breaking $1 billion in sales, the fastest pace ever for a corporate startup. 
Canion left Compaq in October 1991 but continued to be active in other ventures. In 1992, he founded Insource Technology Group, a consulting services and network engineering firm, and continues to serve as chairman. 
Don Jordan has been in the forefront of Houston business and society for decades. And even though he retired from the post of chairman and chief executive at Reliant Energy in late 1999, he has remained active in the city's growth and development. 
Jordan was with Reliant and its predecessor Houston Industries for 44 years and helped position the company for its eventual split between the company's regulated businesses, such as HL&P and Entex, and unregulated business that is now called Reliant Resources. 
Jordan, along with his corporate rival Ken Lay of Enron, was instrumental in the successful campaign last year to convince voters to approve the use of public funds to build a new arena downtown for the Houston Rockets. 
Jordan has spent a lot of time on the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo board and many other civic groups. 
Chuck Watson has built Dynegy into one of Houston's leading energy companies, but he is more well-known for his forays into the world of sports. 
Watson established NGC Corp., Dynegy's predecessor, in 1985 and served as president until becoming chairman and chief executive officer in 1989. 
Recently Watson was revealed to be the largest investor in the limited partnership assembled to put together the Texans, Houston's National Football League franchise. It begins playing next year. 
Watson also owns the Aeros, Houston's American Hockey League team. 
Watson's support was also pivotal to getting voters last year to approve the use of public funds for the new downtown arena. Watson had opposed an earlier deal to use public money to build the facility. 
Watson has also been a strong supporter of Houston's bid to land the 2012 Olympic Games. 
To date, the foundation has awarded more than $1.8 million in scholarships to students pursuing business degree at Texas colleges and universities. 

Recession, Budget Cuts, Travel Fears To Subdue LME Week
By Mark Long
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The many travails of the metals industry will dampen the spirits of those who make it to the annual round of meetings and parties at London Metal Exchange Week, which starts Monday. 
In what is expected to be a much smaller group of delegates than usual, conversations will be dominated by fears of global recession smothering already-lousy demand, the increasingly pressing need for production cuts, and the exit of several important participants from the metals business.
Cuts in companies' travel budgets and fears of flying are keeping many of the usual attendees away from London this year, dealers and analysts said. 
""Sentiment is going to be bearish, and we've just heard in the past few days of people who were previously going to come along not coming, largely on their companies' advice,"" said Adam Rowley, an analyst at MacQuarie Bank in London. 
Indeed, a representative at another major bank said fully half of the guests expected at its satellite activities have canceled. 
Forecasts for base metals demand and average prices have been widely revised downward in the past few weeks, particularly since the impact of the Sept. 11 terror attacks accelerated the world economic slowdown. 
Just this week, Standard Bank ratcheted its expectations lower, with LME cash copper - a bellwether for the complex that's especially sensitive to industrial productivity - seen at $1,350 a metric ton in December 2001, down from an actual year-to-date average in 2001 of $1,619/ton. 
Producers are reluctant to cut copper output, and declining Chinese imports and weak demand in the west mean there is still further downside potential for copper, Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar said. 
With demand for base metals slumping so sharply, eyes have been turning to the producers to make moves on the supply side. 
In copper, analysts say U.S. producers are the most likely to cut back, as the recent strength in the dollar hits their bottom line the hardest. However, a recent slump in energy prices has kept the wolves from the door so far for some producers in an industry that's energy-intensive. 
Elsewhere, zinc is suffering from a supply glut that recently pressured the LME three-month price to a 17-year low of $766 a metric ton. 
The troubles of Australian zinc producer Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS) will surely be a hot topic, following the company's move to voluntary administration due to its large debt load, dealers said. 
But aside from all the market concerns, the most worrisome topic will likely be the recent succession of companies bailing out of or reducing their commitment to the metals business, market participants said. 
In the past week, N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. quit the base metals business and ScotiaMocatta - the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia (T.BNS) - removed itself from open-outcry ring trade at the LME. Earlier this month, Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, and all these moves follow Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. ditching its market-making activities in the metals business earlier this year. 
Who's next? 
""It could be anyone,"" is the refrain from nearly all market participants surveyed.

HC to hear DPC's plea

10/19/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court will, on December 11, begin hearing a petition filed by Enron-promoted Dhabol Power Company (DPC), challenging the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to adjudicate the US-based multinational's dispute with Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
A division bench headed by Justice Ajit Shah decided to hear the matter at a stretch for a week beginning from December 11. The court permitted MERC members P. Subrahmanyam and Venkat Chary to be impleaded as respondents. They have been asked to file affidavits by November 9.
The multinational power giant had levelled certain allegations of bias against an MERC member Jayant Deo. Mr Deo urged the court that he would like to recluse himself from the proceedings. 
DPC was allowed to amend its main petition in view of the allegations levelled against Mr Deo and were asked to amend it within week. 
In his affidavit replying to allegations of bias by the DPC, Mr Deo said he was neutral in his stand as a MERC member. 
The court has made it clear that when the hearing in the case commences, two intervening parties, US Exim Bank and a consortium of 11 offshore lenders of DPC would not be allowed to make any pleadings. The court, however, said they would be permitted to assist the court by making oral submissions.

ENE: The Balance Sheet Matters; Prospects For Further Writedowns

*	ENE shares have declined due to concern over writedowns, actual and
prospective, in our view.  While management announced $2.21 billion in
charges ($1.01 billion through the income statement and $1.2 billion as a
direct charge to shareholders equity) when they reported earnings (see our
10/16/01 note), the prospect of further charges has spooked the stock
*	We think further write-offs are likely at non-core global assets
(Dabhol and South America) and possibly at their broadband unit (already
partially written off).  Several other complex off-balance sheet vehicles
have raised concern.
*	Offsetting these potential hits to shareholders equity are likely
reductions in debt from the proceeds of various asset sales over the balance
of the year
*	Moody's has captured these concerns by putting Enron's senior debt
on review for possible downgrade.
*	We are evaluating these issues and currently maintain our 1H rating.

USA: UPDATE 1-Energy casts some light in gloomy profit season.

NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. 
Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend.
FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. 
Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. 
Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. 
""The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point,"" said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. 
FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS 
""The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically,"" he said. 
Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. 
""Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,"" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. ""These are good, well-financed companies."" 
Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. 
The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. 
Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. 
TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE 
Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. 
Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. 
""Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,"" said Burnham. ""Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months."" 
""Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse,"" he said. 
This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report. 
Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. 
Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner. 
""In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years. 
Future options for the broadband business include ""sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities"" he said. 
""We still think over time that it will be a valuable business,"" Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a ""total meltdown"", he added. 
Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters. 
Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations. 
Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.

USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.
By C. Bryson Hull

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. 
Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.
""What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. 
Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. 
Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. 
The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. 
""They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,"" said Meade. 
Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. 
ILL-FATED BUSINESSES 
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. 
The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. 
Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. 
Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. 
Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. 
DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW 
Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. 
The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. 
All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. 
The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. 
The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. 
In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost the company $1.01 billion.

     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.

     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas
pipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman
and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news
is out.

     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''
said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight
Equity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it
doesn't mean there aren't more.''

     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the
past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO
in August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said
he left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't
confident Enron was detailing all its problems.

                         Failed Businesses

     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are
equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters.

     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New
Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.

     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit
that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as
well as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be
more specific.

     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost
another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired
workers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers.

     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its
water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron
said.

     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than
$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,
Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other
significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''
Lay said.

                         Excluding Losses

     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43
cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes
energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and
taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.
     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock
had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.

     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its
energy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who
helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

                     `Ridiculous Investments'

     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.

     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,
from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in
1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North
American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.

     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the
bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and
taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.

Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.

     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for
the best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments.''

     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money. The company
gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including
coal, forest products and steel.

     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''
Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and
clear, and that the effort is there.''

SEC Seeks Information on Enron Dealings With Partnerships Recently Run by Fastow
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. said it has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking information on the energy giant's controversial dealings with partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. 
Following Enron's announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry, the company's stock took another big slide, falling more than 20% in New York Stock Exchange trading. As of 4 p.m., Enron shares were trading at $20.65, off $5.40, knocking about $4 billion off Enron's market capitalization. Volume topped the Big Board's most-active list at about 36 million shares. A week ago, Enron stock was trading at about $33 a share. Subsequently, the company announced a $1.01 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss.
Analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurking amid Enron's vast and extremely complex operations. The company has dealings with a number of related entities. Under certain circumstances, if Enron's credit rating and stock price fall far enough, the company would be obligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is strong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults. 
In a statement, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company ""will cooperate fully"" with the SEC inquiry and ""look(s) forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" Enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastow-related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed. The company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership-related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions. 
The SEC inquiry came from the agency's Fort Worth, Texas, regional office. According to a person familiar with the matter, this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the SEC's enforcement arm, as opposed to its corporate-finance section. The participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law. However, enforcement-branch inquiries often don't produce any allegations of wrongdoing. It also appears that the SEC hasn't yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation, which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated. The SEC declined to comment. 
Certainly, there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions, which contributed to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of Enron's efforts to unwind the deals. Mr. Fastow, who has declined repeated interview requests, resigned from the partnerships, known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, in late July in the face of rising conflict-of-interest concerns by Wall Street analysts and major company investors. 
Since then, internal partnership documents have shown that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM2, the larger of the two partnerships. 
Mr. Fastow's partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron, according to people familiar with the matter. For instance, these people say, sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999, Enron Treasurer Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr. Fastow's activities. Mr. Skilling didn't share Mr. McMahon's concern, these people say, and Mr. McMahon requested and received reassignment to another post. 
Mr. Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in mid-August, citing personal reasons and the fall in Enron's stock price, which peaked at about $90 a share last year. Mr. McMahon and Mr. Skilling haven't responded to repeated interview requests. 
Investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enron's dealings with other related entities. In some cases, Enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so-called double trigger provisions occur. 
For example, last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II, which sold $915 million in notes that are due July 15, 2003. However, Enron can be considered in default, in advance of that date, if its stock price falls below $34.13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's. 
Currently, Enron debt is still investment-grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category. Last week, Moody's put Enron on review for a possible downgrade. However, observers believe that even if Moody's lowers Enron's rating, the company will still be investment-grade.

Where Did the Value Go at Enron?

What really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen?
Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE>) released its quarterly earnings a week ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions.
The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a preliminary inquiry.
Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.
The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listeners seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings release.
When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity was related to the termination of ""structured finance vehicles"" involving partnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial officer.
""Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how the company goes about its business,"" said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's ""credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its own.""
Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another conference call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today. 
The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many analysts. They referred to such things as ""share settled costless collar arrangements"" and ""derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts."" The disclosures said the company entered into the transactions ""to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets.""
It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall Street Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.
One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot produce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company that sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, ""is the result of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.""
Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the details were not clear, ""Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and they were not"" worth that much.
Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released.
Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.
While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important role in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was only enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.
But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into problems, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the company's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wondered if there might have been similar deals with others.
Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to understand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for doing just that.
In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s request for information. ""We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,"" he said.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION: SEC probes Enron over financial dealings 
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By JULIE EARLE, JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron, the US energy giant, disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start of an informal inquiry. 
The announcement follows a rapid sell-off in the stock in reaction to Enron's surprise revelation last week of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles. 
In revealing the SEC call for more detailed information ""regarding certain related party transactions"", Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that it should be more transparent. ""We welcome this request,"" said Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer. ""We will co-operate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" 
The SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this stage, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. However, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information on an issue. 
Such a probe could turn into a formal investigation at any time. In that case, regulators would be armed with subpoena powers and could demand certain documents be handed over. The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence of the Enron probe. 
Mr Lay did not say which transactions the SEC was reviewing, although analysts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow, Enron chief financial officer, who has been reported to have run a limited partnership that bought assets valued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 
Analysts say the transactions, while controversial because of Mr Fastow's links to the company, have been disclosed. What concerns them, however, is how Enron valued the assets involved. www.ft.com/energy

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Group full of surprises after failing to open up 
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY

Ronald Barone joked he would have to get plenty of rest ahead of Enron's results last week, noting the US energy company's reputation for producing what some analysts say is the most complicated of earnings reports. 
The UBS Warburg analyst was, nevertheless, as ill-prepared as his peers for the announcement of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles. 
The news overshadowed Enron's on-target 26 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings per share, sending the stock plunging. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's subsequent request for more information about Enron's financial activities has reinforced analyst perceptions that the company should have been more transparent in its reporting. 
Curt Launer, of Credit Suisse First Boston, says expectations for more disclosure had built up over the past two months. Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, had promised to be more forthcoming when he resumed the duties of chief executive following the resignation of Jeff Skilling in August. 
While Mr Lay did improve Enron's disclosure by creating headings for new business segments and providing more detail within each of them, the Dollars 1.2bn charge still caught the market off guard. 
""It came as a surprise to us,"" said Stephen Moore, of Moody's Investors Service. ""We should have been informed that it was there."" 
Mr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in ""a fleeting comment"" during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it in its nine-page news release. 
""Despite progress in other areas, there appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved,"" he said. 
Enron contends that ""we did disclose it in the conference call, and it was one of the first points raised in the Q and A session (on the conference call)"". 
Mr Lay has pledged to co-operate with the SEC's request, which appears to be part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation. In the meantime, he adds, Enron will focus on its core businesses. 
That is something analysts say Enron has strayed too far away from. Ray Niles of Salomon Smith Barney says the company's core franchise - its wholesale business - is doing well. Most of Enron's problems have arisen from stepping out of this area. 
""They need to come clean on the financial effects of all of their off-balance sheet financing,"" Mr Niles says. ""Investors want to see clear, easy-to-understand financial information."" Moody's has placed Enron's Dollars 13bn in debt securities on review for possible downgrade and Mr Moore believes there is potential for more write-offs. 
Enron is embroiled in a legal dispute with an Indian state electricity board over a power project and is one of several energy traders facing questions in California over accusations of a manipulation of power prices - a charge it denies. 
Analysts say its UK businesses are not seeing big multiples, and Enron says it only expects to take Dollars 200m in ""goodwill"" versus Dollars 5.7bn on its books.

Enron Discloses SEC Inquiry 
Information Request Involves Ties to Money-Losing Partnerships 
Washington Post
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, October 23, 2001; Page E03 
Enron Corp. shares sank more than 20 percent yesterday after the Houston energy company disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission request for information about Enron's ties to outside investment partnerships set up by the company's chief financial officer.
The SEC would not comment on its action, which Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called an ""informal inquiry,"" not an investigation. ""We welcome this request,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of the Houston-based company.
But the announcement jarred investors' confidence in the giant energy-trading company, already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling in August, and heavy losses from investments in broadband Internet and other technology ventures.
""A lot of people threw in the towel today,"" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York.
The SEC request was made privately last Wednesday, the day after Enron reported a $1 billion write-off of investment losses and restructuring charges from unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations. The write-offs left Enron with a $618 million loss in the third quarter (84 cents a share).
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that $35 million of the write-off was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, and run by him until July.
Enron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased 55 million shares of its stock held by the partnerships that Fastow had directed, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow set up several investment partnerships with the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships engaged in billions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and made major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron.
An Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enron's board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financial officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned millions of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships. What Enron received from the relationships is not clear.
Feygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partnerships, which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncertain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financial statements. 
""In hindsight, that was an error in judgment. I don't think it was an error in principle,"" the analyst said.
Enron could have revealed the SEC inquiry last week but did not disclose it until yesterday, and for many investors, that was the last straw, Feygin said.
The stock closed yesterday at $20.65, down $5.40, as 36 million shares changed hands.

Enron Suffers After Unclear Disclosure, New York Times Says
2001-10-23 06:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission's decision to look into some Enron Corp.
transactions and the company's recent decline in value show what
can happen when a company lets a major reduction in its balance
sheet dribble out, Floyd Norris of the New York Times reported in
his column, citing analysts.

     Investors are concerned as to how Enron reduced shareholders'
equity by $1.2 billion and why this was not mentioned in a news
release the company issued with its quarterly earnings last
Tuesday, the paper said.

     Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent yesterday after the
Houston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission
requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Enron created
partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets
such as power plants to lower the debt on its books.

     ``Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more
clarity about how the company goes about its business,'' said
Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service,
according to the Times.

SEC asks Enron for investing data 
Stock price declines as regulators seek details on partnerships 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Shares in Enron Corp. fell almost 21 percent Monday after the company disclosed federal securities regulators asked for details on investment partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer. 
The request covers transactions between Enron and two private partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that did business with Enron. 
The partnerships entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron declined to say if the SEC's request -- which it called voluntary and said represents an ""informal inquiry"" -- included other issues. 
The SEC request, made by fax Wednesday to Enron and followed up with a call Thursday, comes as the Houston-based energy trader was already fighting to put a series of problems behind it and regain credibility with investors and analysts. 
""It's further bad news, further question marks related to Enron in general and this transaction specifically,"" Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York, said of the SEC request. 
Some investors prefer to sit on the sidelines until the issue clears up, Meade said, adding: ""The level of uncertainty with this stock has gotten pretty high."" 
An SEC spokesman declined comment. 
Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, managed both of the LJM partnerships, according to SEC filings made by Enron last year. 
Both partnerships are described as investment companies that primarily buy or invest in businesses involved in energy and communications. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM partnerships in June amid criticism and questions from some on Wall Street about a potential conflict of interest. 
Investors worried Monday that Fastow's duty to Enron shareholders competed with his duties to LJM, Meade said. 
In a written statement Monday, Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company welcomed the SEC's request. 
""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,"" said Lay, who reassumed the duties of CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned unexpectedly in August. 
Enron said its external and internal auditors and attorneys reviewed the arrangements, its board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, which were disclosed in Enron's SEC filings. 
The issue drew renewed interest from investors and analysts after Enron released third-quarter earnings last Tuesday. 
During the quarter, Enron took $1.01 billion in one-time charges to reflect losses in its broadband, retail electricity and water investments. 
The amount also included $35 million related to ""early termination"" of Enron's relationships with the LJM partnerships. 
During a call with analysts the same day, Enron said it recorded a $1.2 billion reduction to shareholder equity, or the shareholders' ownership stake in the company, as part of the LJM termination. 
Enron declined to answer questions Monday about the LJM entities, including those about their relationship with Enron or Fastow's role with them. 
The day after Enron's third-quarter earnings release, the Wall Street Journal ran the first of three articles highlighting the LJM partnerships, Fastow and Enron. 
The Journal's Friday report said LJM2 ""realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron,"" and that ""Fastow, and possibility a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees."" 
Shares in Enron, which closed last Tuesday at $33.84, ended the day Friday at $26.05. Then Monday, shares in Enron dropped by $5.40 to close at $20.65. 
Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York, believes there were no improprieties surrounding LJM. 
""From inception, the LJM situation was obviously one that would raise eyebrows,"" said Feygin, adding Enron anticipated that and made sure proper legal structures were in place. 
The LJM entities are what's known as off-balance sheet financing vehicles, he said. Generally, they allow a corporation to take on financial obligations without having to report them as liabilities. 
Feygin also said it appeared Enron intended to give Fastow an ""opportunity to participate in the upside from these entities"" to reward him. 
Even though the LJM transactions have been disclosed by Enron, Meade noted that they are complicated, difficult to follow and their implications tough to understand. 
In transactions detailed in an SEC filing made by Enron last year, LJM Cayman received shares of Enron common stock and LJM2 acquired assets from Enron. 
Another filing last year said LJM Cayman and/or LJM2 acquired various debt and equity securities of certain Enron subsidiaries and affiliates. 
Investors are also concerned about potential shareholder lawsuits as well as equity commitments facing Enron from two other financing vehicles called Whitewing and Marlin, Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston, wrote in a research note Monday. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, those equity commitments from Whitewing and Marlin could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
At least two shareholders have already sued Enron's board in state district court, while two law firms filed suit on behalf of Enron shareholders Monday in federal court seeking class-action status. 
Carol Caole, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron from a buy to a hold Monday primarily because of issues surrounding the credibility of Enron's management. 
Several times over the past six months, Caole asked specific questions of senior Enron executives, she said. They denied problems existed, but six weeks to two months later it was revealed there were, indeed, issues, she said. 
Coale recently asked about an SEC investigation and was told there wasn't one. But, she said, it turns out it's an ""inquiry,"" not an investigation.

Minnesota Mining and GM Climb In a Rally That Builds Late in Day

NEW YORK -- During yesterday's Wall Street rally, investors responded with accommodation toward the release of third-quarter earnings results and fourth-quarter forecasts. 
Shares of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing added $5.22, or 5.1%, to $107.39 after the manufacturing company released third-quarter earnings, which narrowly edged out analysts' projections, and spoke frankly of the challenges the company continues to face this quarter in light of economic weakness.
Despite this kind of hesitation about the economy's outlook, investors gravitated toward some of the manufacturing and capital-equipment stocks that tend to struggle during periods of weak economic activity. Shares of General Motors, for example, added 1.21, or 2.9%, to 42.57, Alcoa gained 1.16, or 3.7%, to 32.83, and Fluor, an engineering and construction company, rose 1.79, or 4.2%, to 44.77. 
Stock averages initially struggled for direction, reflecting some skepticism about the sustainability of the market's recent success, before turning firmly higher in the final two hours of trading. Trading levels thinned out, as well; on the New York Stock Exchange, less than 1.1 billion shares changed hands, compared with 1.2 billion shares Friday, an options-expiration session. 
Nevertheless, market averages posted impressive gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved 172.92 points, or 1.88%, to 9377.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 36.77 points, or 2.2%, to 1708.08. 
""We had another one of those days where there is a lack of liquidity, so any moves, in either direction, just get exaggerated,"" Bob Basel, senior trader at Salomon Smith Barney, said yesterday. 
Shares of semiconductor companies, including makers of both chips and chip-making equipment, rose sharply after a spending forecast from Intel, the leading chip maker, proved less grim than some experts had anticipated. The company said its capital spending could be cut 10% to 20% in 2002 from this year's levels; that wouldn't be as severe as some chip industry experts had forecast. 
Shares of Applied Materials advanced 2.22, or 6.8%, to 34.77 on Nasdaq, while KLA-Tencor gained 2.74, or 7.5%, to 39.25, and Lam Research improved 1.36, or 7.8%, to 18.80, all on Nasdaq. Among chip makers, Analog Devices rose 2.57, or 7.1%, to 38.74, LSI Logic gained 89 cents, or 5.6%, to 16.83, and Texas Instruments tacked on 1.17, or 4.2%, to 28.91. For its part, Intel rose 1.15, or 4.8%, to 25.30 on Nasdaq. 
Shares of Lexmark International dropped 5.58, or 11%, to 44.77. The Lexington, Ky., maker of computer printers reported third-quarter results that matched Wall Street's forecasts, but warned that it continues to face sluggish demand in the fourth quarter. 
SBC Communications declined 2.24, or 5.1%, to 41.40. The telecommunications service provider reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' forecasts, and warned that the company won't show ""meaningful growth"" next year. 
Citrix Systems fell 4.14, or 16%, to 21.08 on Nasdaq. Dain Rauscher reduced its rating on the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., maker of computer networking products, saying the company faces competitive pressures from products introduced by rival vendors. 
Jabil Circuit eased 16 cents, or 0.7%, to 22.90. The St. Petersburg, Fla., contract electronics maker adopted a so-called shareholder rights plan, which is aimed at preventing an acquirer from gaining control of the company. 
EMC advanced 68 cents, or 5.9%, to 12.19. The Hopkinton, Mass., maker of data-storage systems signed what was described as a multibillion-dollar enterprise storage agreement with Dell Computer. Dell improved 50 cents, or 2.1%, to 24.55 on Nasdaq. 
SeaChange International advanced 88 cents, or 3.6%, to 25.03 on Nasdaq, boosted by an upbeat research note from Dain Rauscher, which said the Maynard, Mass., provider of video-on-demand technology figures to have posted an upbeat quarter. 
Lucent Technologies declined 20 cents, or 2.8%, to 6.90. UBS Warburg, in a research note, expressed some caution about the outlook for the telecommunications equipment maker's quarterly results. 
Emerson Electric gained 1.38, or 2.8%, to 50.27, even though the St. Louis manufacturer, which makes electronics and telecommunications products, among other product lines, reduced its earnings guidance for fiscal 2001. 
Enron lost 5.40, or 21%, to 20.65, setting a 52-week low. The Houston energy trader, whose stock has weakened since recent articles in The Wall Street Journal raised questions about the company's relationship with two limited partnerships organized by its chief financial officer, said it had received a request for information on Wednesday from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding some of its transactions with those partnerships.

WORLD STOCK MARKETS: Wall St bargain hunters counter earnings gloom AMERICAS 
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By MARY CHUNG

US equities rose sharply yesterday with bargain hunting in technology stocks countering a slew of mostly disappointing corporate earnings and more anthrax scares. 
Gains accelerated late in the session as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 172.92 to close at at 9,377.03 while the S&P 500 index added 16.42 at 1,089.90. The Nasdaq Composite rose 36.78 at 1,708.09. Volume remained light with 1.1bn trades in the NYSE. 
Investors were upbeat in spite of a lack of positive news, suggesting underlying strength in the market and optimism for a rebound, some analysts said. The indices were slightly rattled after news that two postal workers in Washington died after suffering symptoms consistent with anthrax, but the market quickly regained its footing. 
""The market is acting very well. It's come an awful long way in a short time and had to deal with anthrax,"" said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. ""The message is that investors and consumers and the country are in a recovery mode."" 
Semiconductor stocks showed strength with Intel up 4.7 per cent at Dollars 25.30 and Advanced Micro Devices 4.2 per cent at Dollars 9.58. 
Microsoft rose 3.9 per cent at Dollars 60.16 before the launch this week of its Windows XP operating system. Lexmark dropped 11 per cent at Dollars 44.77 after the company reported third-quarter results that met estimates, but warned of a fourth-quarter revenue shortfall. Applied Digital Solutions gained 66 per cent at 58 cents after the company said it had formed a subsidiary to develop and market its ThermoLife thermoelectric generator product powered by body heat. 
3M gave a lift to Dow components, up 5.1 per cent at Dollars 107.39 after the maker of Post-it notes said quarterly earnings beat expectations by a penny a share. The company forecast fourth-quarter profit would be in line with analyst estimates. 
SBC Communications was the biggest decliner within the Dow, down 5.1 per cent to Dollars 41.40 after it said earnings failed to meet Wall Street consensus estimates. 
American Express gained 3.4 per cent to Dollars 30.32 despite reporting a 60 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings. 
Dow components Citigroup and JP MorganChase tacked on 2.5 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively. Shares in Alcoa were up 3.7 per cent at Dollars 32.83 and ExxonMobil 1.4 per cent at Dollars 41.12. 
Enron fell 20.7 per cent at Dollars 20.65 after the energy trading company said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested it voluntarily provide information regarding certain transactions. 
In Toronto the S&P 300 composite index fell just 0.08 per cent to 6,905.21 at the close.

Milberg Weiss Announces Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp.

10/22/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP announces that a class action lawsuit was filed on October 22, 2001, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron Corp. (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:ENE) between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive. A copy of the complaint filed in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on Milberg Weiss' website at: http://www.milberg.com/enron/ 
The action, numbered H013630, is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, located at 515 Rusk Street, Houston TX 77002, against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge presiding over the case.
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors. 
If you bought the common stock of Enron between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as ""lead plaintiff."" Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, or other counsel of your choice, to serve as your counsel in this action. 

Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, a 190-lawyer firm with offices in New York City, San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boca Raton, Seattle and Philadelphia, is active in major litigations pending in federal and state courts throughout the United States. Milberg Weiss has taken a leading role in many important actions on behalf of defrauded investors, consumers, and companies, as well as victims of World War II and other human rights violations, and has been responsible for more than $30 billion in aggregate recoveries.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) will hold a conference call at 9:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday to address investor concerns, the company said in a press release Monday. 
Earlier Monday, a shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit against Enron alleging the board breached their fiduciary duties by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships.
Last week, Enron said it received a request for information about ""certain related party transactions"" from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it would take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
Shares of Enron closed Monday at $20.65, down $5.40, or 20.7%, on New York Stock Exchange volume of 36.4 million shares. Average daily volume is 5.8 million shares. In intraday trading, the shares reached a 52-week low of $19.67. The previous 52-week low was $24.46, reached on Sept. 27.

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)

     (Adds Stilwell shares at bottom.)

     Denver, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Janus Capital Corp., whose
stock funds have lost more than a third of their value this year,
may get another jolt from Enron Corp.

     As of June 30, Denver-based Janus was the biggest
institutional holder of Enron, owning 42.8 million shares, or a
5.71 percent stake in the largest U.S. energy trading company,
according to Thomson Financial/Carson.

     Enron shares have fallen 39 percent over the past four days
on concern that the company's dealings with partnerships run by
its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses. The
Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information on
the partnerships, Enron said.

     Janus, which boosted its Enron stake in the past year in an
effort to diversify its technology-heavy stock funds, is among a
handful of firms including Putnam Investments, Alliance Capital
Management, Barclays Global Investors and Fidelity Investments
that owned more than 2 percent of the Houston-based company as of
June 30, according to Bloomberg data.

     ``It was definitely a real growth darling,'' said Christine
Benz, a senior analyst at Chicago-based fund tracker Morningstar
Inc. ``In a year like 2000, when almost nothing was working for
growth managers, Enron emerged as a story that a lot of growth
managers could like.''

                           Fund Holdings

     According to Thomson Financial, 1,187 mutual funds, or 15.4
percent of all U.S. stock funds, owned a combined 207.9 million
Enron shares as of June 30. Combined losses on the holdings amount
to $2.7 billion since Tuesday.

     According to the latest available data compiled by Thomson,
the biggest fund holders of Enron were: Janus Fund, with 2.15
percent; Janus Twenty Fund, with 1.19 percent; Alliance Premier
Growth Fund, with 1.14 percent; American Century Ultra Fund, with
1.01 percent; Janus Mercury Fund, with 0.88 percent; Vanguard 500
Index Fund, with 0.82 percent; Fidelity Magellan Fund, with 0.73
percent; AIM Value Fund, with 0.6 percent; CREF Stock Account,
with 0.58 percent; and, Putnam Investors Fund, with 0.52 percent.

     Janus Fund has lost 33.2 percent this year through Friday,
while Janus Twenty Fund has lost 33.4 percent and Janus Mercury
Fund has fallen 34 percent. A Janus spokeswoman wasn't immediately
available to comment.

     Morningstar's Benz said she suspects Janus fund managers have
already begun trimming their Enron positions.

     Enron shares had fallen 59 percent this year before last
week's news on concerns about financial reporting and money-losing
investments outside energy trading, such as trading space on
broadband telecommunications networks and building water treatment
plants.

     The stock fell $5.40, or 21 percent, to $20.65 in New York
trading today.

     ``Anecdotal evidence that I'm hearing from the fund managers
there is that they had been trimming pretty aggressively,'' said
Benz. She added that it's ``difficult to make the assertion that
they are in the clear.''

     Janus Capital is owned by Kansas City, Missouri-based
Stilwell Financial Inc., whose shares gained 73 cents today to
$22.52. Stilwell shares have fallen 43 percent this year.


Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)

     (Adds information on conference call in 26th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

     Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

                           Shares Plunge

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

     Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

     Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

                            Bonds Fall

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

     Enron will hold a conference call to discuss investors'
concerns at 9:30 a.m. New York time Tuesday. The call may be
accessed through the ``Investors'' section of Enron's Web site at

Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) stock plunged 20% last week after the energy giant revealed that a complex financing deal caused a $1.2 billion hit to its equity. But other big deals that have yet to receive much public scrutiny could further damage the company's balance sheet. 
In the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnerships called LJM2 and LJM Cayman. An examination of the LJM2-related equity writedown can be found here. 
However, the LJM deals make up only part of Enron's sophisticated financing arrangements. Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron shifted from its balance sheet. These are the $1 billion Marlin Water Trust II and the $2.4 billion Osprey Trust, usually known as Whitewing. 
The key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if they don't unwind as planned. The company may end up issuing stock to repay money borrowed through the trusts. This would dilute existing shareholders. Alternatively, Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on-balance sheet assets. But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and deprive the company's profitable business lines of much-needed capital. 
Whitewing and a Prayer?
Though set up by Enron, Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from the company. Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts. The $3.4 billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron. 
Both trusts are scheduled to unwind in 2003. Originally, Enron had hoped to repay them by selling the trusts' underlying assets. This repayment method would have had a minimal impact on Enron's balance sheet. 
However, there's a potential problem brewing with this approach. The value of the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trust investors. Hence Enron's two unenviable options: issuing stock, or raising cash from its own balance sheet. 
Enron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II won't be sufficient to pay it back. But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of on-balance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin II. When asked if Whitewing's assets are adequate for repayment, Glisan replied: ""We believe so."" 
In reference to the two trusts, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference call Tuesday: ""We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source of repayments."" 
Sterling Marlin
TheStreet.com hasn't seen offering documentation for Whitewing; Enron didn't provide it when requested. But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus. Here's how Marlin II works. Enron took water assets, primarily based in the U.K., off its balance sheet, and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them. Meanwhile, Marlin II issued senior debt to investors, the proceeds of which went to Enron. The company didn't have to recognize these notes as debt on its balance sheet, due to the structure of the trust. Marlin II replaced a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this year. 
Ideally, the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitability of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell them off and pay down the trusts. To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn't raise enough money, Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible preferred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes. 
As it happened, the water assets didn't perform well. In fact, Enron set up Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoid paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock, or with cash from its own balance sheet. This move risked angering the rating agencies that had agreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enron's pledge to backstop it with preferred stock. Suddenly, it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its commitment to make good with stock. 
Enron's Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also invested in Marlin II, illustrating that investors weren't upset by the maneuver. 
Glisan says Enron almost certainly won't decide to issue stock to pay off Marlin II. Instead, he adds, money from pending asset sales can be used to pay it off when it matures in July 2003. When asked if Enron might use the expected $1.9 billion in proceeds from selling Portland General, the utility based in Portland, Ore., Glisan replied: ""That's a good one."" 
But using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enron's frequently stated strategy of selling off low-yielding assets and investing the proceeds in higher-yielding businesses. Portland General is almost certainly a more profitable business than the U.K.'s Wessex Water, which is the dominant asset in Marlin II. In addition, doing so would mean Enron couldn't use all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt. Enron aims to get its debt-to-total-capital ratio down to 40%, from the current 50%. 
Maturity
What about Whitewing, which matures in early 2003? Glisan lists Whitewing's assets as: Central American gas distribution assets; turbines destined for European power stations; interests in European power stations; and various debt and equity participations in energy investments. Glisan says these assets can be sold to pay off the $2.4 billion in notes issued by the trust. 
But what would happen if the Whitewing assets can't fetch the necessary price? Enron could sell off more on-balance-sheet assets. But, again, this wouldn't help debt-reduction efforts, and it may be running short of large assets that it can quickly sell. 
Whitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock. But Enron may be reluctant to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs, and current shareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution. 
Investors also need to keep their eyes on the early-repayment triggers of the trusts. In fact, the stock price-related element of the triggers has already been set off. For Whitewing, the stock has to fall below $59.78; for Marlin II, the stock has to be under $34.13. However, something else has to happen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset sales and stock issuance. Enron's credit rating must fall below investment grade. That looks to be a long shot, since its rating is currently three notches above subinvestment grade. But it is something the market will watch after Moody's said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a possible downgrade. 
Despite all the questions stemming from the trusts, Enron still seems keen to use the structure. Last week, Barclays Capital was inviting investors to subscribe to an Enron-related entity called the Besson Trust. This is being set up to enable Enron ""to monetize substantially all of its interests in EOTT Energy Partners,"" an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crude oil. Expected proceeds from the deal are $227 million, according to the prospectus. Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trusts? 
Due to off-balance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing, it's clear that uncertainty could weigh on Enron's battered stock for some time. 




Why Enron's Writedown Unnerves Some Investors

Enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors, but its decision to reduce equity by $1.2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market. 
The action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner. More important, investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enron's balance sheet, profits and earnings guidance. 
Enron didn't provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction. 
Enron doesn't include a balance sheet in its earnings release, so the equity decrease couldn't be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday. And even though Enron did break out $1 billion in earnings charges in its release, the company didn't feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text. 
Instead, the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call. CEO Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so-called ""structured finance arrangement."" The Wall Street Journal later reported that Enron's counter-party in this transaction was an investment partnership called LJM2 Co-Investment, which has set up and run by Enron's finance chief, Andrew Fastow. 
This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move: ""In connection with the early termination, shareholders' equity will be reduced approximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding."" According to The Journal, Lay then said Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares. 
Enron's supporters count Lay's mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish, because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future. 
But there are two possible problems with this theory. 
First, Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $2.15 per share in operating earnings next year. Critically, the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not. If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares, the company should have upped its 2002 per-share earnings forecast by around 6%, since that's the amount by which the share count will be reduced. Enron needs to say what share count it's using in its guidance. 
Second, it's almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded, casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay's assertion that the share count will come down. 
Why question the CEO? Well, in its 2000 annual report, Enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2. It reads: ""At December 31, 2000, Enron had derivative instruments...on 54.8 million shares of Enron common stock."" The derivative instruments appear to be types of options, or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices. 
But these derivatives-linked shares don't show up where they should in the annual report: in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts. The line item in this table that shows options-related shares totals only 43 million shares, which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion. Therefore, that number almost certainly doesn't include the 55 million LJM2-related shares. The fact is, at least some of the 55 million derivatives-linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options. That's because the LJM2 derivatives appear to have been ""in the money"", or profitable for the holders. Typically, all in-the-money options-based stock has to be included in the diluted share count. And these LJM2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000. Back then, Enron stock was trading around $80, way above the average $68 level at which these derivatives made money for LJM2. 
Maybe these weren't simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count. That's what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply. Alternatively, the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure, though it's hard think where. 
Presumably, investors will get a full explanation in Enron's quarterly financial results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, due by the middle of November.

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the ""market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets."" He added: ""It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets."" 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity.

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, ""I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe."" 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,"" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. ""We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery."" 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. ""If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Dietert says. ""In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow."" 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, ""Why? Ask why."" 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  ""I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants"" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, ""and it's never
been in the news,"" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. ""My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion."" 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  ""Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,"" Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  ""I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance,"" Doot said. ""Those things have in fact
happened from time to time.""

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN
2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits
2001-10-26 15:36 (New York)

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)
2001-10-26 16:18 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking ""non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,"" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron to axe 500 in attempt to boost profits.
By JULIE EARLE.

Financial Times (U.K. edition)

Enron, the US energy group and trader, yesterday confirmed it would cut 500 jobs, or 10 per cent of its European workforce, in an attempt to improve profits. 
Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, is under pressure to restore the company's share price, which has slid more than 60 per cent in the past 12 months.
The cuts, flagged last week, will scale back operations Mr Lay had previously said would be critical to the company's future growth. John Sherriff, Enron Europe's president, said business continued to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but the company was ""seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth"". 
Enron Europe has 5000 employees. Mr Sherriff said the headcount would be cut by between 5 and 10 per cent, and the company hoped to achieve this through voluntary severance. 
Gordon Howald, an energy analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities in New York, said Enron had been criticised over its strategy to increase cash flows. 
""They are trying to slash their workforce and are selling Portland General Electric. This is good timing. When financials are under pressure, it probably makes good sense,"" he said, adding there had been rumours of US job cuts, outside of the previously announced Broadband division job cuts in July. 
Enron yesterday denied there were further job cuts planned in the US. 
Last week Enron said it had agreed to sell the electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for $1.8bn, a disposal it had been planning for some time. 
Enron shares closed $1.81, or 5.4 per cent, higher at $35.20 in New York yesterday.

In college, they call it grading on the curve. In business, it's known as forced ranking. 
In both cases, regardless of performance, someone's going to fail. The practices reward those who perform better than their peers. That's the American way.
But they also can punish those doing good work -- just not as good as others. In college, grading on the curve means failing a course despite learning the material and either being forced to repeat it or flunking out. In business, forced ranking means that every year some arbitrary number -- often 10 percent -- get put on notice that they must improve. Or sometimes they get fired. 
Traditionally, business has used competency-based evaluations of employees. That is, can they do the work? Forced ranking sets up a totem pole. Everyone has a place on that pole, from the top to the bottom. 
And the pole gets chopped off from the bottom. 
About 20 percent of American companies use forced ranking, according to an article on the subject in the Harvard Management Update, a newsletter from the publishing arm of the business school. 
Some companies used forced ranking only for top managers. Others use the system for all managers, or all exempt employees who are not on hourly wages. 
Some of the most admired companies use the process -- General Electric, for example. Here in Houston, Enron uses a five-point scale with 15 percent in the bottom ranking. 
Proponents of forced ranking say it makes managers confront a perennial problem: that of low-performing managers and employees. 
Not only do the low performers cause problems now. If they neither improve nor leave, they block promotion for people who might do a better job. 
Productivity and morale sag. Fewer top people want to join the company. The best performers leave. 
In what seems to be the endless American cycle of hiring and layoffs, forced ranking also gives managers some objective criteria to use when it's once again time to let people go. 
But forced ranking also can raise the usual cries of discrimination that any ranking system brings. At Microsoft, an African-American plaintiff sued, claiming his low ranking came because of his race. At Ford Motor Co., which has dropped forced ranking, the charges of discrimination came from middle-aged white males. 
Forced ranking has provided a much-needed boost at some companies -- ones that have not confronted performance problems of managers over the years. 
Still, after a few cycles of forced ranking, companies must decide what's next. So you've weeded out the slackers. You've helped those who needed help to improve their performance. Overall, the company is doing a much better job of getting the products or services out the door. 
Inevitably, companies will reach a point of diminishing returns. If every manager or exempt employee is at least competent at his or her job, is it really worth it to rate and arbitrarily fire 10 percent or so of them every year? 
Sure, that's going to keep everyone on their toes as they scramble to keep their jobs. But it may not be all that good in encouraging teamwork. 
And, as France's army found in World War I, the practice of decimation -- arbitrarily shooting 10 percent of your own troops to encourage the others to fight harder -- does not tend to raise morale. 
Forced ranking also seems to me to be based on the wrong premise -- that is, that companies need to be filled with high-performance people from top to bottom to succeed. 
That may not necessarily be true. Every organization really needs a mix of people. For example, organizations need a leavening of malcontents. They stir up things, get people thinking, challenge assumptions. Yet an organization composed of nothing but malcontents won't work. 
Sure, every company needs top performers. They are the yeast that causes the organization to rise. But companies also need the steady and the sturdy and people with limited imagination to take care of the millions of details that must be faced every day. 
It's the equivalent of taking out the trash. It's not inspiring work, but unless it gets done, it gets smelly.

India: Greenfield Shipping rejects German bailout offer

10/11/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

NEW DELHI, Oct. 10 IN a fresh twist to the crisis facing the $220-million LNG shipping deal for Dabhol Power Company, German-based KG Finance Group has made a proposal to the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company to bail out the project. 
""The promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company, however, rejected the proposal ab initio,"" sources familiar with the developments told Business Line.
The bailout proposal was made by the German agency during discussions held in London recently between the representatives of the three promoters (Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, SCI and Atlantic Commercial Inc) and the lending consortium led by ANZ Investment Bank. 
As per the offer, the KG Finance Group would facilitate the completion of the 137,000-cubic-metre capacity tanker to be used for transporting LNG from Oman to Enron's power plant at Dabhol. 
The LNG carrier would be converted into a German asset by bringing it under a special purpose vehicle (SPV) registered in Germany. The tanker would be operated by German crew. 
The Greenfield Shipping Company is registered in the Cayman Islands and would fly a Maltese flag. The German entity had also proposed to tie up finances for the entire arrangement through a mix of public and private funding. 
KG Finance Group was of the view that the Greenfield Shipping Company had paid an ""unbelievably higher price"" for the LNG tanker by contracting it a rate of $220 million. In its reckoning, the vessel building price was at least $15 to 20 million higher than the market price prevailing then. 
Against this backdrop, KG Finance Group had told the representatives of the Greenfield Shipping Company assembled in London that the tanker would fetch not more than $65,000 per day as charter hire rates, the sources said. This was against the charter hire rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company. 
The German agency had also said that it would charge a commission of 3 per cent for finalising the deal. 
The proposal was turned down by the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company on the grounds that transferring the asset from a Maltese flag to a German flag would deprive the tanker of depreciation benefits. 
""Besides, the project will not break even at a charter hire rate of $65,000 per day,"" the sources said. 
The offer made by KG Finance Group comes in the wake of a crisis facing the promoters of the LNG shipping project after the lenders suspended the last tranche of the project loan of $55 million, citing an event of default. 
The project promoters will not be able to take possession of the LNG carrier if the remaining project cost of $55 million is not paid to the shipbuilding yard. The crisis has been compounded by the fact that Enron is planning to exit from the project by selling its 20 per cent stake in the venture. 
While various permutations and combinations have been discussed between the joint venture partners, nothing has taken a concrete shape so far, dragging the venture into deeper uncertainty. 
While making its offer, the German entity had drawn attention to the not-so-rosy LNG market globally. The LNG vessel prices are now ruling at about $165 million. 
""Besides, about 24 LNG vessels are lying idle world- over. Even two new vessels delivered recently are lying idle without any commitment to charter,"" the sources said, pointing to the bleak scenario prevailing at the moment which has steeply driven down the charter hire rates for LNG ships.

CM rejects NCP plea for probe into Enron dispute

10/11/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has rejected a demand by the Nationalist Congress party (NCP) for reconsideration of a judicial probe being set up into the Enron controversy. 
Mr Deshmukh told a press conference here on Wednesday, ``As far as we are concerned, the issue of a judicial probe into Enron is over.''
Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, sitting adjacent to him, kept mum when Mr Deshmukh's attention was drawn to the demand by the NCP, the principal partner of the ruling Democratic Front. 
NCP president Sharad Pawar had stated at a public meeting last week that his party would not be responsible if the state had to pay arbitration costs to Enron running into hundreds of crores of rupees. Similarly, NCP spokesman Vasant Chavan had alleged that the decision to institute the judicial probe needed to be reconsidered. 
Mr Deshmukh's outright rejection of the demand could be another reason for tension between the Congress and the NCP, sources said. 
Hiking of water supply charges by the DF government is another major issue that has been hanging fire. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee president Govindrao Adik and other leaders had attacked the government's decision to the hike. When Mr Deshmukh was asked to state the government's response, he announced that the matter would be referred to the DF coordination committee.

AEP Puts Wholesale Operation Behind Growth Targets
By Jon Kamp
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/10/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

COLUMBUS, Ohio -(Dow Jones)- Top officials from American Electric Power Co. (AEP) outlined the utility's growth objectives in a conference with financial analysts Wednesday, emphasizing its plan to lean on wholesale operations for future growth. 
AEP also noted how a planned corporate separation plan, expected to wrap up by the end of 2001 pending regulatory approval, will help by separating and clearly defining the company's unregulated operations.
""That is clearly going to be the major growth driver for AEP,"" said Henry Fayne, executive vice president at AEP and the newly-named head of the company's regulated operations. Fayne is also the outgoing chief financial officer at AEP. 
AEP officials said the company is targeting 8% earnings per share growth on a year-to-year basis for an undefined period. Because regulated utility operations are typically a slow-growth business, AEP expects wholesale operations to increase their contribution to earnings by at least 10% each year going forward. 
On a shorter term basis, Fayne reiterated AEP's guidance for 2001 earnings in the $3.50 to $3.60 a diluted share range. A poll of 12 analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call, by comparison, shows the company earning $3.59 a diluted share for the year. 
AEP also maintained its 2002 earnings guidance, though it said a planned power plant acquisition announced this week should boost results by at least six cents. The company said Monday that it plans to buy two 2,000 megawatt coal-fired power plants in the U.K. from Edison International's (EIX) Edison Mission Energy unit for $960 million. 
With that deal, 2002 earnings should fall into the $3.80 to $3.90 a diluted share range, Fayne said. A Thomson Financial/First Call poll of 13 analysts puts 2002 earnings at $3.88 a diluted share. 
To achieve its longer term targets, AEP plans to lean heavily on its expanding wholesale trading operations. Currently, the company is the second largest wholesale electricity trader in the U.S. after Enron Corp. (ENE), and it ranks in the top ten in natural gas trading. 
The company expects to become a top-five natural gas trader as early as the fourth quarter this year, and to continue expanding electricity trading as the market evolves. And the company's aggressive growth plans shouldn't be deterred by current weakness in natural gas prices, or by wholesale power prices that are barely above generation costs in key U.S. markets, said Eric van der Walde, executive vice president of marketing and trading at AEP. 
The company continues to move into new markets and to use sophisticated analysis to devise market strategies, and because it isn't simply trying to sell electricity above cost, it isn't held back by sluggish markets, van der Walde said. 
""It's not negative for us to have markets where the prices are declining,"" he said. 
Fayne also noted that the performance at AEP's fleet continues to improve, which effectively adds more megawatts to its portfolio. Power plants in the company's eastern Midwest base, where it operates nearly 24,000 megawatts of power, ran at 91.8% capacity in 2001, up from 87.6% capacity a year ago. The company expects continued improvement for 2001. 
Aside from the U.K. power plant acquisition plan announced this week, AEP said it remains open to other future power plant purchases. Though the company doesn't believe it needs to always own power plants in areas where it markets power, like the West Coast, owning assets in those areas can still be helpful, said E. Linn Draper, AEP's president and chief executive. 
""We would be open to the idea of trading something here for something somewhere else,"" Draper said. ""Nothing is sacred in terms of the portfolio. Anything is fair game."" 
The company does plan in the near term to hold on to its large Cook nuclear plant, a 2,110-megawatt generator in Michigan that regained full operations at the beginning of 2001 after a three-year outage, Draper said. But because there has been so much consolidation in the nuclear power industry, the company is open to considering some method of outside management that might allow it to share resources with other nuclear utilities.

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative
2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to ""buy- speculative,"" from ""buy-high risk"", to reflect his concerns that ""lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations."" 
""This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,"" he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual."" 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 


Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
""It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,"" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
""We're always willing to sit down with a customer,"" Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
""To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,"" he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
""That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,"" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
""We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,"" Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. 
In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. 
The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. 
Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. 
Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. 
In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 
Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. 
Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. 
States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. 
In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. 
In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. 
Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. 
In major U.S. market action Wednesday: 
Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. 
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron
Corp. Common Stock

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox
(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and
certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is
brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common
stock of Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,
2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants
engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates
and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial
position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from
the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve
Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an
artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held
positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of
interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these
transactions.

The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants
made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's
Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share
price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never
post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to
make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to
maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.
Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband
business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in
financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing
arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,
its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's
finances from its investors and the market, further artificially
inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially
inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482
million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of
the above practices.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is
represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.  Our firm, with offices
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years of
experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions

              Mark Haines, co-anchor:

              Joe Kernen, what's going on?

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as ""other"" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff

Shell  (Stasco, Equiva)--no trades

Bank of Montreal--no trades  (started several weeks ago)

Phibro--appear to be no trades, but hard to confirm

Diamond Shamrock has a very small spread position on with us, and asked us to find someone to stand between.

"Entergy- Koch","I spoke with Troy Martin at Entergy-Koch this morning and have proposed the following bilateral collateral matrix to Master Netting Agrements which we are negotiating.  He will propose this structure to David Sobotka, the President of Entergy-Koch, and will let us know.

			US			Europe
BBB+/Baa1		$30mm			GBP20mm		Original lines were $60mm and GBP30mm
BBB/Baa2		$15mm			GBP10mm
BBB-/Baa3		$10mm			GBP5mm
BB+/Ba1 and below	$0			0

US Master Netting Agreement covers Master Agreements for phyiscal gas, physical power, and financial swaps.
UK Master Netting Agreement covers Master Agreements for UK physical gas and UK physical power.

Our current exposure (as of 10/23/01) is as follows:

			US			Europe
			$(43mm)		~$(40mm) or ~GBP(27mm)

Total collateral outstanding is as follows:
			
			US			Europe
			$8.5mm (incoming)	GBP20mm
			$15mm (outgoing)

Net impact is we post additional $6.5mm in US and will be able to reduce our L/C in Europe by GBP13mm.

CA May Seek to Reneg. Power Deals; Headline/Political Risks Re-emerge

*	Expect Calif. Gov. Gray Davis will announce today plans to
renegotiate power contacts that the California Department of Water Resources
(CDWR) signed with suppliers earlier this year. 
*	Potential exposure for: EPG, DYN, WMB, MIR, NRG, CPN, AYE, CEG and
SRE, but estimate in the low single digit range, if any (See Table). DUK and
REI not exposed,    as contract expired or none signed.
*	Main risk: resumption of Calif. headline risk, which had subsided
earlier this year with the decline in power prices. 
*	It appears that none of the power companies have yet been contacted
by the state, and it is unknown what approach that the state may take.  
*	Some companies have expressed a willingness, but no obligation, to
discuss the contracts, but would push hard to retain the NPV of the deals.

"FW: Budget Update and  Research project","
FYI below from Webb on the project with Webb and Vince Kaminski (EOL trade data).

Also, on 2002 budget, we agreed with EA OTC (Louise) yesterday on their total ENW budget for 2002 broken out into EnronOnline, Operations, Systems Development and IT Infrastructure for both expense and capital with Systems Development broken in to two portions, one supported by operations and one supported by gas and power commercial.  We will work with EA, EGM, EIM, and EEL next week to see if we can get them to accept a pricing structure for EOL that is more service and transaction based.  Brad is working with Louise, Sheriff and Shankman on this and our goal is to get something structured in this manner.

We also plan to get the EIM and EGM OTCs to agree to their complete budgets early next week.  ENW also has a meeting with the EES OTC on their ENW budget next week.

Due to all these numbers moving around so much (mostly down) and in an effort to keep Kerry Roper, Sally Beck and Pickering  focused on making progress with the business units, I am going to wait until next Tuesday or Wednesday to have a new ENW 2002 packet sent to you if that is OK.  Since we met with you on the total ENW budget on October 15th, EA alone went down $6 million in expense and $31 million in capital. We are making good progress down on EIM and EGM as well.  EES might be a different story. 

When you get that packet, you will see 2001 forecast vs. 2002 plan on the date we met you (October 15th) vs. where we are on October 22nd for 2002 Plan.  You will also have the total IT depreciation across EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EEL, ENW, EBS.  This is slowly trickling in but we feel good that we can get it right.

Please e-mail me back if you need anything sooner or if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks.

Hi Greg,

We created the database for them and gave them access a couple of weeks ago.  Last week, we created a tool for them to make it easier to mine the data and get subsets of data into Excel.   This afternoon we're releasing software that will keep this database updated in real-time.  That is going to be great; we may even consider switching all reporting to this database.  Finally, I extended an offer to a guy yesterday to be our full-time representative on this project. 

Next steps:
   1. create a schema for capturing price tick data.
   2. begin capturing price tick data in real-time on some EOL products.
   3. begin capturing external feeds like Nymex, FX, treasuries, stock quotes.

Mike and Jeff :
Here is a copy of a new article from Bloomberg which featured Enron and crude. I think both Andrew and Matt displayed exceptional professionalism. I also think this reflects well on our business unit. In addition to the story, I have included Andrew's directives on this matter.

All,

Congratulations to Matt Anderson.  Through building and developing a network of media contacts Matt has been quoted by a Bloomberg Journalist in a news article.  Not only does this reflect well on Enron as a company, it also serves as a great reflection on the Fundamentals Group.  Well done Matt.

Portraying ourselves as a quotable and authoritative source will allow us to build credibility both internally and externally, so there is no reason why other groups cannot follow Matt's example.  However, given the potential pitfalls we would like to use this as an opportunity to point out a few vital do's and don'ts in order to avoid potential problems.

Do's

Do think very carefully about what you say - your comments will be seen my the masses and will reflect on both you and Enron.
Do pass your quotes and comments through your Line Manager who will approve them and get them certified by the Press Relations department - this is a company rule and something taken very seriously by Senior Management.


Do Not's

Do not comment on specific companies, Enron included.
Do not, ever, give investment advice or stock recommendations.  Not only is this company policy, it is also a legal requirement by the SFA.
Do not say anything you don't believe implicitly or can't justify and back up both plausibly and convincingly.

The text of the article can be found below :-

     Singapore, Sept. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil rose on                       
speculation that OPEC might cut production at a November meeting                
if prices don't rally in the weeks ahead.                                       
     The producers, after meeting yesterday in Vienna, left their               
output targets unchanged, though they've trimmed them by 3.5                    
percent this year as demand slipped from a sagging economy. Saudi               
Arabia is urging members to meet their quotas, which they exceeded              
by an estimated 3 percent in August. OPEC still may reduce                      
production if prices stay low, Iran's oil minister said.                        
     ``The focus on compliance is an intermediate step between a                
cut and doing nothing,'' said Matt Anderson, an analyst at Enron                
Corp. in Houston. ``They want credibility as guardians of oil                   
price stability, and don't want to be seen hurting the global                   
economy.''                                                                      
     Crude oil for November delivery rose 36 cents, or 1.6                      
percent, to $22.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange                 
during floor trading overnight. It rose another 21 cents to $22.95              
in after-hours electronic trading. Crude oil on Wednesday fell as               
low as $20.30 a barrel, the lowest since August 1999.                           
     Oil is still 17 percent below the level the day before                     
terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11.                                       
     Brent crude oil for November settlement yesterday fell 21                  
cents to $22.79 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange                
in London.                                                                      
     ``Our credibility is only as good as the continuation of the               
effort among our member countries'' to meet their quotas, said                  
Chakib Khelil, Algeria's oil minister and OPEC's president.                     
     The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has an                   
informal accord to cut supply if its price index stays below $22                
for 10 consecutive days, though Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali                
al-Naimi, has indicated the group may not use that method for                   
boosting prices.                                                                
     Al-Naimi said yesterday that OPEC members would seek to                    
improve compliance with existing output targets as a means of                   
boosting prices.                                                                
                                                                                
                        Managing the Market                                     
                                                                                
     ``We have a strong willingness to manage the market,''                     
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told reporters after                 
meeting with al-Naimi in Vienna. ``We think that the non-OPEC                   
members should contribute with OPEC members to solve this                       
situation.''                                                                    
     OPEC's goal is to keep the price of its oil index within a                 
range of $22-$28 a barrel. The index was quoted at $20.11                       
yesterday.                                                                      
     Excluding Iraq, the only member without a quota, OPEC

exceeded its September quota of 23.201 million barrels a day by                 
5.8 percent, according to PetroLogistics, a Geneva-based                        
consulting firm. A Bloomberg survey early this month estimated                  
that the producers were 3 percent above their goals in August.                  
     The 10 OPEC members exceeded their combined quota this month               
by 1.35 million barrels a day, said Conrad Gerber, president of                 
PetroLogistics, which tracks oil shipments.                                     
     The producers said they will meet again on Nov. 14.                        
     Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez called for a meeting of the               
heads of state of OPEC members to define a strategy to defend                   
against slumping oil prices.                                                    
     ``We need to prepare another meeting,'' Chavez said late                   
yesterday on returning from a trip to Colombia. ``We have to                    
defend prices under any circumstances.''                                        
     OPEC heads of state met last year in Venezuela, their first                
summit since 1975. Venezuela in August was OPEC's third-biggest                 
producer, after Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to Bloomberg                   
estimates. Iraq was a close fourth.

Subject:	Reinsurance impact update report: 9/24

Attached is our updated report on the Sept. 11 impact on the insurance/reinsurance industry.  We appreciate your feedback and will provide updated reports upon receipt of further follow-up questions/taskings.

Executive Summary
Immediate short-term impacts are already being felt in the global aviation sector.  Japan's two leading airlines have seen their rates rise sevenfold, amounting to almost US$140 million.  The US airline industry has already secured US$15 billion in government-sponsored financial help, including assistance with insurance and liability issues for the next six months.  
Sources concede that the industry will be forced to change its focus back to risk analysis and be less customer acquisition-focused (in the sense that premiums will need to rise to compensate).  Moody's has already indicated that several insurance and reinsurance companies will be rated negatively following the impact of the attacks.
Other generally accepted long-term impacts include a reduced capital base, higher risks and expected losses, acquisition of smaller players, better investment opportunities for insurers and reinsurers, and possible government involvement.
Several well-informed industry sources have serious doubts about Lloyd's stability.  Most of their policies are not guaranteed.  Significant Lloyd's shareholders such as Ace and XL are also negatively impacted.  
Table 1 shows revised claims estimates to date for the major insurance and reinsurance companies.
Table 2 shows total estimated losses and change in stock price to date for the major insurance and reinsurance companies.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron impatient at power deregulation pace.
By Chris Baltimore

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Nearly 10 years after Congress passed the Energy Policy Act in 1992 to promote competition in the nation's $220 billion wholesale power market, Enron Corp is growing impatient. 
From the U.S. Supreme Court to Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Houston-based energy and commodities trading giant has spread its open-market gospel.
""Five years ago we clearly thought we would be much farther along than we are now,"" Rick Shapiro, Enron's managing director of government affairs, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. 
""Finishing the job of making wholesale markets work across the U.S. is our number one objective,"" Shapiro said. 
Enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate. With wide-ranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth, oil and natural gas, its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors. 
For the power market, that means Enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines, the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on short-term price imbalances. 
UTILITIES BLOCK COMPETITION 
Enron's big problem? Traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation, Shapiro said. 
""Vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board,"" he said. 
In its pleas to Supreme Court justices and regulators, Enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition. 
The Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the U.S. power industry and decide whether FERC has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks. 
In a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf, Enron wants the court to give FERC more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors. 
Meanwhile, New York has brought a companion case that says FERC has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states. 
""This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds,"" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, said at the oral argument. 
New York wants the court to revoke FERC's authority to regulate retail sales, contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation. 
""I think a victory for New York would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country,"" Shapiro said. 
""FERC has jurisdiction. All they need to do is exercise it,"" Shapiro said, echoing Enron lawyers' case to Supreme Court justices that existing laws give FERC the power to do Enron's will. 
Enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans, Shapiro said. ""FERC is doing its job on the electricity front. I'm not sure that legislation is required on that front."" 
FERC SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS 
With new Chairman Pat Wood at the helm, FERC is moving in the right direction to drive competition, Shapiro said. ""It's early in his tenure,"" Shapiro said of Wood. ""Many of the signs are promising."" 
Wood has made so-called regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them. 
RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems. Enron sees RTOs as a positive step toward competition. 
In what he called a ""carrots and sticks"" approach, Wood signaled in late September that utilities must either join RTOs or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets. 
FERC will hold a week-long meeting on RTOs beginning Monday. 
Enron is skeptical that carrots are useful, and is a bigger fan of sticks, Shapiro said. 
Utilities have ""gotten quite fat over the last nine or 10 years,"" Shapiro said, and will shrug off FERC's incentives. ""I'm not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies,"" Shapiro said.

UK: Enron's European electricity trading volumes soar.

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron on Friday said it traded five times as much wholesale electricity in continental Europe during the first half of this year as in the same period last year. 
Continental power trading director Gregor Baeumerich told Reuters the company traded 523 terawatt hours in the first half - roughly equivalent to annual German power demand - up from 93 terawatt hours in the first half of 2000.
""On average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties,"" he said. 
Liquidity in Germany, Europe's biggest power market, had risen partly due to more trading by municipal utilities, he said. 
Baeumerich said volumes in the French power market had risen sharply in recent weeks after Electricite de France last month auctioned off access to 1,200 megawatts of it generation capacity. 
He said annual contracts for physical baseload power for 2002 were trading daily. Up to 30 companies participated in the French market. 
""Utilities from across the continent are trading the French market,"" said Baeumerich. 
Much of the trading took place on France's borders with neighbouring countries, he said.

Northwest Natural Picks Merrill, CSFB to Arrange $2.1 Bln Loan
2001-10-12 13:05 (New York)

Northwest Natural Picks Merrill, CSFB to Arrange $2.1 Bln Loan

     New York, Oct. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Northwest Natural Gas Co.
picked Merrill Lynch & Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston to
arrange a $2.1 billion loan to help finance its acquisition of
Portland General Electric, said bankers familiar with the loan.

     The high-yield loan, the largest announced since the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, will include $450 million of
working capital. Another $450 million will be replaced by a junk
bond of the same size, the bankers said.

     Merrill, which advised Northwest on its acquisition, will
manage the bond sale. Credit Suisse advised Enron Corp. on the
sale of Portland for $2.9 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt
to Northwest.

     Portland, Oregon-based Northwest also plans to issue $150
million of common equity once the acquisition is closed, according
to Chief Executive Richard Reiten. The company expects a nine-
month to 12-month regulatory approval period, Reiten said.

     Northwest is forming a holding company to take on the debt
needed to finance the transaction. Standard & Poor's said that the
debt at the holding company is expected to be rated below
investment grade. The utilities -- Northwest Natural and Portland
General -- are expected to keep their investment-grade ratings,
S&P said.



UK: INTERVIEW-Metals screen trade set to evolve - Spectron.
By Andy Blamey

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Electronic trading of base metals futures has established a firm foothold in the market but the nature of online trading platforms looks set to evolve further, says Gavin Gross, head of LME metals at Spectron Futures Ltd. 
UK-based energy and commodities broker Spectron's electronic platform for the trading of London Metal Exchange (LME) contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the LME's own system LME Select and the Enron Group's EnronOnline.
""I think we've proved that people will trade LME derivatives contracts online, because there are some great advantages to doing so,"" Gross told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
""And unlike the physical markets, where things haven't really taken off online, all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market."" 
Both Spectron and LME Select are neutral platforms in which Category 1 and Category 2 LME members trade with each other, while EnronOnline is open to a wider membership but has Enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction. 
This leaves a gap in the market for a multi-party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community, Gross suggested. 
""I think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online,"" he said. 
Direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker, he said. 
""Clients will have the advantage of more control, more visibility and more transparency in what they do. However, they'll have to pay for services,"" Gross said. 
""You could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions, certain institutions would provide clearing, others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market-making."" 
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS 
Difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities; this week alone has seen N.M. Rothschild & Sons exit base metals trading and both Bank of Nova Scotia and Enron looking to scale back. 
""On the LME now you've got low volumes, falling volatilities, falling prices and we're in the grips of a bear market. It's very, very poor for business in general,"" Gross said. 
""There are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business...Each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels."" 
Spectron has not been immune from declining volumes. 
""Our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic, way beyond what we had expected. However, our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter,"" Gross said. 
""That's due to two factors: first, the overall market activity is lower, and second LME Select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of."" 
The company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform. 
""We're beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently. That might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service,"" Gross said. 
But, he stressed, ""we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost."" 
UNCERTAINTY 
In the current environment, the LME's refusal to throw its weight behind either open-outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to ""allow the market to decide"" - may prove to be counterproductive, Gross said. 
""By having two systems running side by side ... the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions,"" he said. 
""There's a feeling that the ring is doomed, which doesn't do anything to encourage its use, while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you're still only seeing a trickle of business going through Select in terms of overall volumes."" 
While preferences vary in different sectors of the market, the current uncertainty is helping no-one, he said: 
""Metals traders just want to trade. They just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money.""

USA: Citizen wins two Petroecuador oil contracts.

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Oil firm Citizen won the remaining two of Ecuador's crude oil contracts by matching the price differential of $6.97 below West Texas Intermediate (WTI) set by another bider, Petroecuador said Friday. 
Petroecuador awarded U.S.-based Citizen two contracts, each of 12,000 barrels per day (bpd), for three months after matching Coastal Petroleum's bid of $6.97 under WTI, with a floor price for WTI at $20 per barrel.
Petroecuador last week retendered eight three-month crude lots, each for 12,000 bpd, following a price dispute with former contract holders that led Ecuador's state oil company to break the deals. 
Enron Corp. and Rio Energy were awarded earlier this week one 12,000 bpd contract each, while Anglo Energy and Coastal each will take two contracts. 
The new contract holders will start loading their first cargo during the first half of November, a Petroecuador official said. 
Petroecuador will set the price of Ecuador's crude for December and January based on market values.

British Court Blocks Indian State's Enron Challenge, AP Says
2001-10-12 12:25 (New York)


     Mumbai, Oct. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bid for
international arbitration over its Dabhol Power Co. project to
recover claims of as much as $5 billion can't be delayed with
legal action by an Indian state government, a Commercial Court in
London ruled, the Associated Press reported.

     The injunction prevents the Indian state of Maharashtra from
initiating legal action that would delay arbitration of disputes
over the Houston-based power company's project, AP said, citing
Enron.

     The injunction obtained Wednesday is separate from a case
pending before the state-owned Maharashtra Regulatory Commission,
AP said. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has said it can't
afford the energy prices negotiated seven years ago.

     An Indian court has ordered a stay until a decision is
reached on whether the commission has jurisdiction in the matter.
Enron has a 65 percent stake in 2,184-megawatt power project,
India's biggest foreign investment, AP said. The company wants to
pull out of India and recover its investment and that of its
partners, General Electric Co. and closely held Bechtel Group.

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Adds comment from CFO Fastow in fourth paragraph, Enron's
short-term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its
finances. The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends
on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to
finance day-to-day operations.

     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13
billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,
any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to
$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declined
to comment.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.

     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying two
partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership
of them was a conflict of interest.

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books.

     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may have
to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's
debt ratings fall too far.

Enron CFO: Company Has Sufficient Liquidity
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.
In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a ""Chinese wall"" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
The procedures were ""rigorously followed,"" Lay said. 
In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were ""reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties."" 
Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. 
The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. 
During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. 
Lay said the company would be providing a list of ""Frequently Asked Questions"" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. 
After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
Lay said he was ""extremely disappointed"" in the current stock price. 
""Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business,"" he said. 

During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. 
Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a ""worst-case scenario."" 
However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. 
Moody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. 
According to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. 
""We are committed to maintaining our ratings,"" Lay said. ""Moody's said they would work with us,"" he added. 
Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have ""sufficient liquidity"" to meet all its capital requirements. 

Enron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. 
Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
""Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that,"" Lay said.

Enron says shareholders' 'best interests' were sought in all LJM dealings

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp said it sought the ""best interests"" of its shareholders in all its dealings with LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships which were set-up and run until recently by Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
""The board (of Enron) was fully aware and kept a real Chinese wall between Enron and LJM. Enron's shareholders best interests were sought in all LJM dealings,"" said Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay, in a conference call with analysts.
The company scheduled the call after Enron's stock slid 21 pct yesterday, when it revealed the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. 
Overnight, two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against Enron and its officers, alleging that operating results were also ""materially overstated"" as a result of the company failing to timely write-down the value. 
In its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, of 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders' equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow resigned from the partnerships in July, due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests. 
During the call, Lay said that he, and Enron's board of directors, have ""the highest faith and confidence in (Fastow)."" 
Lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations, and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating. 
Analysts have raised the possibility that, should Enron's credit rating and stock price continue to fall, the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with.

US class action suit filed against Enron for misleading statements

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against Enron Corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between Jan 18, 2000 and Oct 17, 2001, thereby inflating the company's share price artificially. 
The suit was filed on behalf of Enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the US District Court in Houston against Enron Corp, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned recently, and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
The suit claims that Enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy.
The company's operating results were also ""materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships"" managed by the company's CFO. The suit additionally alleges that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. 
On Oct 16, Enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non-recurring charges of 1.01 bln after-tax, or 1.11 usd per share, which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's chief financial officer. Enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd. 
Enron's share price consequently fell sharply. During the class period, Enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally-held Enron common stock. 
Holders of Enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than Dec 21, Milberg Weiss said. 
Yesterday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions.

Word of SEC probe puts Enron into deep dive: Problems mount

NEW YORK - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20% yesterday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.
The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. 
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took US$1.01-billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined US$5.49, or 21%, to US$20.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shaving off almost US$4.2-billion of its market capitalization. 
The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8% yesterday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into ""certain related-party transactions"" involved the partnerships. 
""Related-party transactions"" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Mr. Fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy- and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported US$35-million of its third-quarter loss of US$638-million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, ""most notably in telecommunications,"" have declined precipitously. 
""Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined,"" Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
""This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
""It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one."" 
The price of shares in the company is down 75% this year.

City - SEC inquiry sparks Enron share fall.
By Simon English.

in New York 
ENRON, the American power giant, saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which Mr Fastow has, or had, links. 
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement: ""We welcome this request. We will co-operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" 
Questions were raised last week on Wall Street after the company announced a write-down of more than $1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses. 
The disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23pc. Yesterday they fell another $5.30 ( #3.80) to $20.75 in early trading. 
According to the annual report the ""related party transactions"", as Enron describes them, took place in 1999 and 2000, resulting in losses of $16m and $36m respectively. 
Mr Lay said that auditors approved the deals, but would not give further details of what they were. 
They are understood to have been hedging transactions against Enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment JP. 
""We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done,"" added Mr Lay. 
The relationship between the investment losses and the SEC probe is not clear, though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions. 
Enron owns Teesside Power Station and Wessex Water in Britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the US. Investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company's credit rating. 
An Enron spokesman said Mr Fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion. 
The SEC inquiry is ""informal"", says the company. The watchdog contacted Enron last Wednesday, the day of the results announcement. The SEC declined to comment. 
Enron made a loss of $638m in the third quarter, its first in over four years.

Shares of Enron Plummet 21% Energy: SEC requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive.

Shares of Enron Corp. set a 52-week low Monday on word that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the Houston-based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said it had voluntarily provided information on ""certain related-party transactions"" that had been previously disclosed to the SEC.
""We welcome this request,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive. 
""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,"" he said. 
The SEC request is the latest in a parade of bad news for Enron, which has seen investments sour in telecommunications, retail electricity sales and water. 
Investors have battered the company's stock, which once sold for nearly $85 a share in the last year, and many have criticized Enron's stingy meting out of financial information. But several Wall Street analysts remain upbeat on the stock, noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn. 
In August, Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, one of the main architects of the company's strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit, stunned Wall Street by resigning. 
Skilling cited personal, family-related reasons, but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company's stock price contributed to his departure. 
On Monday, Enron shares plunged $5.40, or nearly 21%, to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron's stock has lost nearly 40% of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third-quarter loss of $618 million after $1.01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments. 
But the charge also included $35 million related to what Enron described only as the ""early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity."" 
In a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings, the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions. 
But investors were stunned when stories last week in the Wall Street Journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and that Enron had whittled $1.2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $1.2-billion note it had received from the partnership. Shareholder equity now stands at $9.5 billion. 
The limited partnership, called LJM2, and Fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved Enron assets and stock, the Journal reported. 
Lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed. 
A shareholder lawsuit charging that Enron's directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in Texas state court. 
Many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes, but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them, analyst say. 
Investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that Enron has guarded financial information, making it difficult to analyze the company's complex web of businesses. 
And many are not confident that all the bad news has been released. 
Analyst M. Carol Coale, who follows Enron and other energy companies for Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron to a ""hold"" from a ""buy"" rating Monday out of such frustration. 
Coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of Enron. 
But Bob Christensen, energy analyst with First Albany Corp., said that despite Enron's recent difficulties, the bulk of the business remains strong. 
""I continue to tell investors that 70% of this company's business is growing at a 26% rate, and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on,"" he said. 
Investors are panicking because of a ""bad news story that doesn't reflect reality,"" said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with the Raymond James & Associates brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
""They are the world's largest energy trader, and they are very good at that,"" Cartwright said. 
""The reality is that everything is fine here,"" although more charges, perhaps $500 million worth, are expected in the next few quarters, related to businesses that Enron is selling.

OUTLOOK Enron Q3 EPS 43 cents vs 34

10/11/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is expected to report next Tuesday third-quarter earnings per share of 43 cents, compared with 34 cents a year earlier, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 17 brokers. 
The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.
Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. 
Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. 
Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position. 
Lay is likely to remain in the position until it is filled within 12-18 months, Tulis said. 
The company remains embroiled in arbitration proceedings in India after its 2.9 bln usd Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to pay bills that now total about 45 mln usd.

UK: UPDATE 1-Rothschild exits base metals, precious unaffected.
By Andy Blamey

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Blue-blooded banker N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd said on Thursday it would shut down its base metals trading operations except in Australia - the third base metals trader this week to announce cutbacks. 
Rothschild remains firmly committed to its precious metals activity, however, company managing director and group treasurer Geoffrey Spice told Reuters.
The company, the merchant banking arm and UK branch of the Rothschild family's financial empire, chairs the twice-daily benchmark price-setting London gold fix. 
""In light of difficult trading conditions in the base metals markets, we have concluded that our limited base metals operation is no longer viable,"" company Chairman Sir Evelyn de Rothschild said in a statement. 
""We've been reviewing the situation for quite some time. We've found that trading conditions (in base metals) have been difficult and opportunities have been limited,"" Spice said. 
Rothschild would not be taking on any new positions in base metals but would see existing positions on its books through to fruition, according to clients' wishes, he said. 
Rothschild is a category 2 (associate broker clearing) member of the London Metal Exchange (LME); the company would maintain its LME membership while existing positions run their course and would review it in due course, Spice said. 
The move to exit base metals will involve the closure of Rothschild's metals sales desk in New York and a number of redundancies in the London and New York trading, sales and support areas, the company said. 
Employees were informed of the decision on Thursday afternoon; around 20 Rothschild staff in total would be affected by the move, Spice said. 
The company's Australian base metals activities would continue as normal, however, he added. 
""Australia has a very strong franchise and will continue to operate in the base metals market,"" he said. 
The Rothschild move follows news this week that the Bank of Nova Scotia will scale back its base metals trading desk and that Enron Metals plans to cut around 10 percent of staff as a part of a Europe-wide job cut programme. 
Base metals traders have been struggling in recent months in the face of falling business volumes and sagging metals prices as continuing economic gloom and uncertainty after the September 11 attacks on the United States leave buyers sidelined. 
PRECIOUS METALS STRONG 
Spice stressed, however, that the company's precious metals operations would continue as normal. 
""We have a very strong position in precious metals which will not be affected in any way,"" he said. 
""N M Rothschild remains strongly committed to our core business in precious metals and continues to be at the forefront of spot, forward and option bullion markets and a leading member of the London Bullion Market Association,"" the company statement said.

INDIA: London court gives Enron India unit respite in row.

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service

BOMBAY, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp . said on Thursday it had obtained a ruling from a London court preventing a provincial government from legally challenging international arbitration proceedings. 
Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Company, has taken a local Indian utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London for a breach of contract.
The utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, had signed a contract to buy the output from Dabhol's $2.9 billion power plant on the western coast of India. It later said it did not need all the power from the 2,184 MW plant, and that it was too expensive. 
But a local regulatory authority, the Maharashtra State Electricity Commission, said the power company's dispute with the utility fell within its ambit, and that Dabhol could not proceed with the arbitration. This sparked a round of litigation, which is now at a stage where the Bombay High Court must decide whether Dabhol can take the dispute to London. 
In order to prevent more litigation, Enron obtained an injunction from the Commercial Court in London which restrains the government of Maharashtra, which owns the utility, from also filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings. 
""Over the past few months, the government of Maharashtra and other government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations,"" Dabhol said in a statement received late on Thursday. ""This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago."" 
Government officials were not be reached for comment.

ECUADOR: Three firms accept Ecuador oil contracts at WTI-$6.97.

QUITO, Ecuador, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Anglo Energy, Enron and Rio Energy agreed to match the price of $6.97 below West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for Ecuador crude contracts for November, a Petroecuador official said Thursday. 
Petroecuador last week retendered eight three-month crude contracts, each for 12,000 barrels per day (bpd), following a price dispute with former contract holders that led Ecuador's state oil company to break the contracts.
The company awarded Coastal Petroleum two contracts on Friday at WTI minus $6.97, with a floor price for WTI at $20 per barrel, and offered other interested companies the chance to match this price for November. 
Petroecuador will set the price of Ecuador's crude for December and January. 
Anglo Energy will take two contracts while Enron and Rio Energy will take one contract each, the official said on the condition of anonymity. 
It was not immediately clear what would happen to two crude contracts sought by Glencore. Glencore had yet to respond to the offer on Thursday, the source said.

UK: Asian clean tanker freight seen falling - brokers.

LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Asian petroleum product trades are likely to benefit from falling freight costs next week, as a raft of surplus tankers makes its way towards Singapore, tanker brokers said on Thursday. 
""There's a lot of ships ballasting down from Japan, arriving from the middle of next week onwards,"" said a Singapore broker. ""From October 15 to 20 there will be eight to 10 ships in the area. Rates will fall further.""
He said that intra-Asian freight rates had already started to slide from a spike that topped W280 at the start of the week to W260 on Thursday ($17.52 per tonne). 
He said that transpacific trade, which often serves to tighten up the intra-Asian market, was dead. 
""The only arbs that are open are gasoline to Singapore from Europe and jet going the other way,"" he said. ""Cargill did 35,000 tonnes from Malacca to UK-Cont on the High Challenge: we're guessing jet."" 
London brokers said Enron had also booked a ship, the Teekay Freighter, to shift 70,000 tonnes of gasoil from Jamnagar, India to Europe. 
Brokers said that the Mideast Gulf trade, which occasionally sucks surplus ships out of Asia, was also quiet. Glencore booked two tankers for 40,000 tonne clean cargoes from Yanbu to East Coast India at W235, down 15 points on week-ago levels. 
""Long Range trades from the Gulf are quiet,"" said a London broker. ""Nothing's happening so it's difficult to know where rates stand, but basically it's going down."" 
A panel of brokers from London's Baltic Exchange pegged the naphtha trade on 75,000 tonners from the Gulf to Japan at W189 late on Wednesday, following a fall of eight points from week-ago levels.

LOCAL
DANIA RESIDENTS POKE HOLES IN PIPELINE PLAN

A proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to Broward County drew harsh reviews Wednesday from an audience in Dania Beach. 
Not a single speaker spoke in favor of the project, although one or two were neutral, during a public workshop held by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the I.T. Parker Community Center.
""It is totally insane to put a high-pressure natural gas pipeline through such a densely populated area,"" said Susan Epps, of Oakland Park. ""The loss of life and property if there would be an accident would be catastrophic."" 
The commission is preparing an environmental impact statement for the project. More workshops will be held once a draft is ready. The process is expected to take several months. 
Enron Corp. of Houston proposed the pipeline as a way to meet the state's growing demand for natural gas, a relatively clean and increasingly popular fuel for power plants. Two other companies have made similar proposals. 
Enron's representatives say construction of the pipeline would do minimal damage to the coral reefs in its path. And it is an extremely safe way to transport natural gas. 
But few people in the audience saw it that way. 
Dan Clark, a member of a Broward County group that monitors the health of coral reefs, said that the company's representatives painted too rosy a picture of the project's impact on coral reefs by claiming that drilling a path under the reefs would leave them unharmed. 
""What they failed to tell you is that they're going to have to assemble the pipe across the second reef and drag it across the second reef,"" he said. ""At a time when we're losing these habitats, we don't want to lose any more, willingly."" 
Some speakers questioned the wisdom of bringing in another source of fossil fuels, however clean it may be, rather than putting more effort in conservation and renewable energy. 
""Why don't we regulate people's use of energy?"" asked Judy Kuchta, of North Beach in Hollywood. ""Why do people have to waste energy playing stupid video games and watching mindless TV?"" 
Several speakers worried about the project's effects on John U. Lloyd State Park, a popular beachfront park under which the pipeline would run. 
""The park simply can't sustain the additional degradation of pipeline construction and operation,"" said Sara Case, speaking for Save Our Shoreline, a Hollywood conservation group. ""The beach is one of Broward County's most important sea turtle nesting areas. Shore birds are attracted to the park. We simply find it difficult to believe that significant environmental damage is not inevitable from this monumental project.""

Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, plans to cut as many as 500 jobs in Europe, or as much as 10 percent of its work force there, to reduce costs and boost profit. 
The company has 5,000 workers in Europe and plans to trim jobs by 5 percent to 10 percent. ""Business continues to grow in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company, we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less,"" John Sherriff, chief executive of Enron Europe, said.
