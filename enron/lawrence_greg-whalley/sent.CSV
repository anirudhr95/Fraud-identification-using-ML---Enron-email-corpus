 <<Enron Proprietary Trading Proposal III.doc>> Dear Greg and John,

     Following up on the call we had with John
     on March 19, the attached Executive Summary
     describes a joint venture between Enron & WR Hambrecht,
     a securities capability focused initially on proprietary
trading
      of common stocks in the technology sector as the first
phase
     of a relationship which could expand further to take
advantage
     of financial market opportunities including equity
derivatives trading
     and market making, fixed income agency block and
principal trading,
     fixed income and hybrid securities derivatives, and ECNs.
The
     financial model provided envisions supporting a
relatively small
     initial effort to control enterprise risk as well as to
provide a setting
     wherein Enron and WRH can begin to work together.
Economics
     should scale well in tandem with the amount of committed
and
     reinvested capital.

     In order for Enron to investigate this JV opportunity in
depth, we
     would like to propose as a next step a meeting at your
offices wherein
     we may speak at some length to our ideas for
collaboration.

     In addition to this proposal, as discussed, we remain
interested in
        exploring a separate effort focused on the area of lease
securitization
     and would appreicate your guidance on how to proceed with
initial
     conversations within Enron on this front.

     Thanks for your consideration. I look forward to speaking
with both
     of you.

     Leslie Mueller
     Head, Corporate Marketing

Subject: Singapore Overnight 5/9/00

Crude  -  Rather quiet day on the physical front with one Oman deal reported 
@ -10.  Mkt still expecting Chinese to come in and buy Oman once the diffs 
get down to the mid teens. However, AG is getting cleaned up for June 
loaders.  Reported that CPC Taiwan mutually agreed with a seller (Statoil ) 
to cancel a early June loader of Oseberg that they had bought a couple of 
weeks ago.  They say they won't rebook it now that the strike is over. 
Paper -  FTB's were off early on the back of announcement that Norweigian 
strike was over.  Recovered later in the day on the Brent recovery. 
Tapis weaker vs Brent with EFS @ 35 and Dubai weaker as well with EFS @ 2.28. 

Gasoil : Once again, Singapore gasoil lagged behind crude and other products. 
June swap traded between 26.35 - 26.60 usd/bbl with East / West at - 10 
usd/mt (versus - 8 usd/mt yesterday). Front-to-back widened with June / July 
at 0.15 / 0.30 and June / Q3 also improved by 10 / 15 cents/bbl. Crack under 
pressure with Q3 at 2.90 / 3.20, a drop of 20 cents/bbl.  Three sellers this 
evening : Onyx , Shell and Marc Rich with the most aggressive offer at 27.0 
usd/bbl or MOPS + 0.50,  Caltex bid a cargo at 26.30 usd/bbl or MOPS + 0.20 
but no deal concluded. 

Jet / kerosene : Regrade being sell down with June at 1.85 / 2.00 and July at 
2.40 / 2.50 by the end of the day.  With limited outlets for the prompt jet, 
front-to-back will be forced to open up so that some barrels will go to the 
storage. Four sellers this evening (including three majors) - Caltex, Shell, 
BP and J Aron with the most aggressive offer at 28.30 usd/bbl, but still 
attract no buying interest.

fueloil-physical price tread lower as bp n hinleong test the mkt without 
bidding today n shell offer down to 153/mt.paper held yesterday nos thru the 
day at 143.5-144.25 june jul 138-139 jun/jul held at 5/5.5 crack widen 
further to 1.5/bbl for june n 1.9/bbl for jul negative.kepco tender to buy 
lsfo for june dlvry.physical mtk is tight thru may n early june for 180cst n 
will see the strength to surface later in the mth when the main players price 
in cargo totally.stay bullish on fo though temporary n time being looks soft.

Subject: Interviews


Hey Greg,
I enjoyed interviewing with both you and Jim last week
friday. I would like to talk to you some more about
the opportunities available in Enron Networks. Two
areas I thought would be interesting would either be
helping to structure a market for Enron Networks to
enter, or help develop a market that Enron Networks is
in the process of entering.

A couple of things that I thought were interesting
about your strategy for B2B is that unlike most
business plans where the strategy is build the site
and the volume will come, Enron uses it's own volume
to entice other people to participate. What most
e-commerce sites want to do is charge for the dating
process, but in reality this has very little value
added unless the market is coupled with a
finance/clearinghouse function and a physical delivary
system for physical goods. We addressed some of these
issues in the ilogex business plan.

I have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan to
give you an idea of some of my thoughts on e-commerce.
 I look forward to talking to you tommorrow morning.

Thanks,
Brad

Subject: 


Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a ""Bundle Products"" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

"Re: April 3rd Class","Mr. Bodily,

I was able to speak w/Greg this morning and I regret to inform you that he 
will not be able to join your class via video conference on April 3rd as we 
had previously hoped.  

Greg will have to leave Houston for some of our overseas offices beginning  
April 2nd for approx. two weeks (London, Tokyo & Sydney).  I do apologize for 
the short notice, but these things tend to happen quickly, and with little or 
no notice.  

Please provide me with some possible future dates during the month of May and 
I will discuss them with Greg.

Subject: April 3rd Class


Greg,
I understand from your assistant, Liz, that you will be able to join my
colleage Venkat and I and our eStrategy class on April 3 10:00-11:25 Eastern
Time (9:00-10:25 Central) by videoconference.  That is wonderful news for
us!

We have a T1 line in our classroom and we can connect using two-way video so
that you can see the class members and they can see you.  I know that we can
also arrange to put your power point slides on one screen and your face on
another, if we wish to.   At some point we'll get your technical people and
our technical people to work out the details on the connection.  We would
want to verify soon that our systems are compatible.

We can chat about how to use the 85 minutes we have.  I was thinking that we
ask the students to prepare the digital case, The Transformation of Enron
1986-2000, in which you appear in a few segments in living color, and you
look great, I might add. Liz said she thought she could a copy of the CD
from Sherri, Jeff Skilling's secretary, or, alternatively, I'll be happy to
send you a CD.  In addition to the case, I would like to give the students
additional new material (accessible on the course web-site) about Enron's
new ventures in the online and electronic network world.  (We could use a
little help from some of your people to get the best materials, I suspect).


In class, we could have a case discussion led by Venkat and I for (say) the
first half of class, and followed by your presentation/talk for the last
half of class. Or we can give you more or less of the time--let's talk about
it.
I was hoping that you could direct the focus of your talk toward topics such
as the following:
1.  The strategy for new ebusinesses at Enron.
2.  Enron's strategic advantages and competitive positioning in the digital
economy.
3.  Examples of laws of network economics in the digital world
4.  Implementation of Enron's digital strategy.

We need to prepare specific assignment questions for the students to
prepare.  Some of them could be taken from the introduction to the case,
which we could supplement with additional questions from you or that we
devise together.

This will be a great experience for our students and for Venkat and I as
well.  And we are flexible about how much time you want to take and also
about your specific topic.  So please give me a call (or email) and we can
settle on a plan.

Thanks very much for your willingness to participate.

We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, 
given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe 
Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and 
reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount 
to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 
(US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

"RE: Draft of Organizational Announcement","this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

"Re: Sept 20 / 21 Napa Valley","Rick,

I was able to speak w/Greg and Mike McConnell on your Napa Valley 
conference.  Unfortunately, Greg nor Mike are able to attend.

Many Thanks,

Subject: Sept 20 / 21 Napa Valley




Greg -

Thanks for giving some additional thought to sending an Enron representative 
to
Chase H&Q's Energy and the New Economy conference. I think your suggestion of
Mike McConnell is great  -- in fact I saw a piece on energy e-business in
Sunday's Chronicle in which Mike was heavily quoted albeit in his former role 
as
CEO of Enron Global Technologies. I don't know Mike well but met him a couple 
of
times in London in connection with a financing that Chase led on the TGTL
situation.

Anyway, you had asked about other presenters and format.

The format will be a panel dicussion during which each company will give a 10 
-
15 minute business overview probably in a powerpoint format with books for
audience members to take away. Following the formal presentations there will 
be
questions both from the floor and from the moderator to be addressed by all
panel members.

Assuming that EnronOnline is able to participate on the Energy Exchange panel
the moderator will be yours truly -- so I'll be serving up some softballs for
Mike.

The other confirmed panelists for the Energy Exchange session are:

Houstonstreet.com -- Howard Smith
Enemetrix.com - John Gaus
Downstream.com - John Ireland

We are expecting good attendance from industry (both incumbants as well as new
economy types) as well as from the buyside. So far there are over 100
participants and I expect we see a number of additional confirmations between
now and the conference.

Logistically, Mike would need to fly to San Francisco on Wed Sept 20 -- we 
will
work with him on transport up to Silverado Resort in Napa Valley. The panel 
will
be first thing on Thursday Spet 21 (probably around 9 am) after which Mike 
will
be free to attend other conference sessions, play golf, tour wineries or
whatever.

The full list of sessions  includes:

Distributed Generation
Communications
B2B
Investor Perspectives
Energy Exchanges
Energy Retail
Venture Stage
European New Energy

"Re: FW: Gas Curve Validation April 2001","you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but 
there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that 
showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like 
that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Are you needing to do this during the month of April?  Throw me back some 
dates to play with.  The 3rd &4th week of April are no good.  Early May could 
work out fine, it that's not too late.

Hey Greg!

Though you're unavailable on March 21st to speak at Stanford, Stanford still 
wants YOU!!!

Will you please check your calendar and  propose some dates you can make it 
there--the class is about 50 Exec eds, CXO levels form high profile 
companies.  It would be an easy presentation--about 1hr 1/2 on ""The evolution 
of Enron"".

Thanks!

Christie,

If Greg comes to the Bay Area sporadically, we can plan around that.  What I
have in mind now is our E-Commerce Seminar (Wednesdays every two weeks)
which is an open forum for discussing E-Commerce issues.

To: All Enron Employees North America

Subject: Super Saturday Changes

The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weekend 
is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous 
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on &selling8 
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will 
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have 
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Super 
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions 
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron 
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant.   
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to have 
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees and 
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant 
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evaluate 
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron 
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages 
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will 
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We 
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To 
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the 
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students will 
rotate. 
In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates.  
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of 
the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that 
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation 
forms are completed and input prior to the meeting. 
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on 
Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday 
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 PM 
to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron,s executive management 
team.  Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.  Kevin Hannon, 
Jeff Shankman, John Lavorato, Rick Causey and Dan Leff will facilitate 
subsequent meetings. 
Need for interviewers.  There has been a tremendous response to the call for 
dinner participants; however, we are still in need of interviewers for each 
of the Super Saturdays.  Please respond with your willingness to interview 
at:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp    
(When selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who 
attend the schools for which you are a team member).
We thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program.

Subject: White Paper



Greg,
?
I had sent this white paper to Kenneth  Lay.?? When I followed up with him, 
his office suggested that I send  you a copy of our Offshore Development 
white paper.? Primarily, the white  paper addresses the reasons and cost 
benefits to offshore development.?  
?
SI Systems is an American company that specializes  in interfacing with 
global development centers to provide American?project  management and 
communications.? With the offshore model,  companies?reduce their IT 
budgets?significantly and the fact that the  development is offshore is 
transparent to our clients with SI Systems as the  interface team.?? Our 
clients do not have to communicate after hours  with another country to 
ensure their project is on track, we do that for  them.? Additionally, we 
offer ethics regulation to ensure that our  customers receive fair?and 
expected pricing throughout the project  lifecycle.
?
We have partnered with?10 of the best of breed  offshore companies to ensure 
that?we?can provide?a  variety?of application development languages with the 
best quality.?  Paul, I will follow up with you this week to see if?you?would 
like to  explore this model further.?

High Regards,

Subject: Draft of Organizational Announcement

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with the all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These 
investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private 
equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new investments 
unit.

This new group will report to an investment committee consisting of Greg 
Whalley, Ken Rice, and Dave Delainey.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick and the other members of this group in 
this effort.

Greg,
Certainly hope you can join us for the keynote session to describe one
year's experience with EOL and what's in store next.  Tim Ling, chairman of
TradeRanger -- the fourteen-company procurement consortium with BP Amoco,
Shell, Unocal, Total Fina and others -- has confirmed.  Still working with
the others.

August 17, 2000

Greg Whalley
Vice Chairman & CEO, Enron Net Works LLC
Managing Director, Enron Corp.
PO Box 1188
Houston, TX  77251-1188

VIA E-MAIL: WHALLEY@ENRON.COM


Dear Greg:

To follow with my phone message, please consider accepting a keynote speech
for Interactive Energy, Tuesday morning, Oct. 24, in Houston. We've
confirmed either the head of the E-Commerce Practice or the North American
Energy Practice from McKinsey and have issued invitations to Tim Ling, the
chairman of TradeRanger (the Shell, BP, Unocal procurement hub), and John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP.

Interactive Energy has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
e-strategy event (see www.interactiveenergy.com).  Skilling gave the keynote
last year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents from
Halliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote
session.  More than 1,450 executives attended.  Given the large number of
early registrations and the strong program, we expect this year,s to be much
larger.

Ideally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and
describe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and
objectives in this area.  The target audience for the conference is senior
energy management who are integrating technology into their core business
strategies.

Interactive Energy 2000, which will have more than 100 speakers, will cover
technology development across five sectors:

1) Upstream
2) Transportation & Logistics
3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)
4) Wholesale
5) Retail

Press Coverage:
The conference has been a high priority for the trade press as well as the
general media.  At previous years' events, we had editors from more than
twenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street
Journal, FT Energy, Oil & Gas Journal, Oil & Gas Investor, World Oil,
Bloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.  National Public
Radio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.  As
result of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,
including Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil & Gas Investor, Houston Business
Journal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,
Energy Commerce and others.

Benefits:

Enron Net Works will benefit in four ways:

? First, you will educate customers and partners.  Cisco is bringing some 70
senior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most
interested in your perspectives.  Energy buyers from such organizations as
Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium) have
attended in previous years.

? Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba, Luminant,
IBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron,s
vision.

? Third, you will educate employees.  Some 43 executives from Enron attended
last year,s event.

? Fourth, you will persuade recruits.  Capable professionals in this area
are in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of
Enron's innovations and rapid growth.

I hope that your calendar is clear.  Look forward to the possibility of

Greg,
Certainly hope you can join us for the keynote session to describe one
year's experience with EOL and what's in store next.  Tim Ling, chairman of
TradeRanger -- the fourteen-company procurement consortium with BP Amoco,
Shell, Unocal, Total Fina and others -- has confirmed.  Still working with
the others.
Bob

Managing Director, Enron Corp.
PO Box 1188
Houston, TX  77251-1188

VIA E-MAIL: WHALLEY@ENRON.COM


Dear Greg:

To follow with my phone message, please consider accepting a keynote speech
for Interactive Energy, Tuesday morning, Oct. 24, in Houston. We've
confirmed either the head of the E-Commerce Practice or the North American
Energy Practice from McKinsey and have issued invitations to Tim Ling, the
chairman of TradeRanger (the Shell, BP, Unocal procurement hub), and John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP.

Interactive Energy has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
e-strategy event (see www.interactiveenergy.com).  Skilling gave the
keynote
last year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents
from
Halliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote
session.  More than 1,450 executives attended.  Given the large number of
early registrations and the strong program, we expect this year's to be
much
larger.

Ideally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and
describe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and
objectives in this area.  The target audience for the conference is senior
energy management who are integrating technology into their core business
strategies.

Interactive Energy 2000, which will have more than 100 speakers, will cover
technology development across five sectors:

1) Upstream
2) Transportation & Logistics
3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)
4) Wholesale
5) Retail

Press Coverage:
The conference has been a high priority for the trade press as well as the
general media.  At previous years' events, we had editors from more than
twenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street
Journal, FT Energy, Oil & Gas Journal, Oil & Gas Investor, World Oil,
Bloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.  National
Public
Radio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.  As
result of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,
including Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil & Gas Investor, Houston Business
Journal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,
Energy Commerce and others.

Benefits:

Enron Net Works will benefit in four ways:

?    First, you will educate customers and partners.  Cisco is bringing
some 70
senior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most
interested in your perspectives.  Energy buyers from such organizations as
Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium)
have
attended in previous years.

?    Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba,
Luminant,
IBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron's
vision.

?    Third, you will educate employees.  Some 43 executives from Enron
attended
last year's event.

?    Fourth, you will persuade recruits.  Capable professionals in this
area
are in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of
Enron's innovations and rapid growth.

I hope that your calendar is clear.  Look forward to the possibility of
working with you and your staff.  I'll call to follow up.

Yours respectfully,

Bob Nimocks

"Re: FW: Enron Everywhere","don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing 
power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in 
oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in 
Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our 
fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring 
into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in 
EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are 
setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping 
origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you 
make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in 
the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's 
and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, 
structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are 
pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an 
Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant 
development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan 
or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our 
projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call 
Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

"RE: Draft of Organizational Announcement","this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

"United Way Executive Solicitation","As you know, Enron,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way.  
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize the 
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kick-off of the 
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  Enron,s 
United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporate match). 
ENW,s share of this goal is $161,700.  While these are aggressive goals, they 
are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we can easily 
surpass these goals. 

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I,d like to have 100% 
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important 
among our executives.  We define ""participation"" as an employee who has 
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the 
level.
 
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I,ll need the 
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across 
the ENW organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision 
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our 
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENW.  Your 
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our 
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENW by giving generously and 
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

I trust that you are doing well.? In reference to the email below, I will

Importance: High 

Greg, 

I do hope you remember me, and that Liz Taylor passed the note on to you 
requesting a meeting with you regarding possible re-employment with Enron, 
but more specifically, employment with Enron Net Works.? I believe that you 
are running the efforts of that group, and I am more than excited to speak 
with you about employment opportunities.

Although you have interviewed me in the past for the crude oil options 
trading position (1996, my first year at Enron), the passage of time 
hopefully allows me to refresh you on my background, in brief.

Pursuant to working at Enron, I currently work at Chematch.com, a leading 
online, real-time B2B Exchange, concentrating in the petrochemical and 
polymer industry, but with reaches into the fuel products arena.? I was one 
of the first dozen employees. We were the first movers of our business type 
in this vertical.? My role here has been on the 1) business development 
efforts, 2) prime member on the venture capital raising process, and 3) prime 
member of the IPO process/due diligence team.? Most recently, I was promoted 
from Vice President to Vice President & Senior Officer, heading the entire 
content portion of our firm (petrochem.net).

Prior to joining Enron, I attended the University of Chicago Graduate School 
of Business and received an MBA with concentrations in Analytic Finance and 
Accounting.? Prior to that, I spent three years on Wall Street with Merrill 
Lynch and Prudential Securities, in in both investment banking and FI capital 
markets.

If you need a couple of quick recommendations from Enron, I would humbly 
suggest Fred Lagrasta, Jeff Shankman, Harold Buchanan, Donald M. Black, Greg 
Woulfe, and others of your choice.

Attached is my resume for your review.? I know the extremely busy schedule 
that you uphold, but would greatly appreciate the chance to meet you once 
again to discuss any opportunity you may see fit for me within your group.

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to ""soak up liquidity"" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

""Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself,"" said 
Altra's Coleman. ""But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another."" 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply ""providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace."" 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the ""Big Brother"" 
of the energy marketplace. 

""The historical information is not available,"" EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
""We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well."" He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

Hi Greg:
?
I have been fascinated by Enron's move into bandwidth for some  time now.? I 
firmly believe no company is in a better position to  understand the dynamics 
of the market or the importance of providing liquidity,  market-makers and 
transparancy to a market.
?
I am the CEO of a company called Bid4me.com, inc.? We are  an?start up with 
an eye for innovation in the internet solutions  field.? In particular, we 
are looking to bundle huge groups of small and  medium sized businesses 
into?blocks and force vendors to?bid  aggressively for their businesses in 
a?unique two-stage reverse auction  process.
?
We are?currently in stealth mode, however, our business  model so impressed 
Pillsbury Maddison Sutro, LLC (please see http://www.pillsburylaw.com ) that 
they  accepted us as clients on a deferred fee basis.
?
Our vision is to work with Enron to bring greater savings to  SMEs.??We will 
bring hundreds of SMEs' internet access demands at once  to several vendors.? 
Very few of them will be able to accommadate such  demand without appealing 
to companies like Enron for the provision of extra  bandwidth.? We would like 
to not only bring the SMEs to the vendors to bid  on but?to offer the vendors 
a bandwidth discount through exclusively using  Enron's market-place.
?
This way everyone benefits, including Enron.? Enron get's  a huge block 
demand for bandwidth and?its market-makers get the  revenue.??Enron will also 
gain greater credibilty through getting  increased liquidity flow.
?
The vendors, e.g. Adelphia Business Systems, benefit by  receiving a block 
discount through Enron and by receiving revenue from a large  block of SMEs.
?
The SMEs benefit by receiving savings passed on to them from  the Enron 
discount and through using the soon to be patented Bid4me  model.
?

Our website is currently housed on a Stanford University  Server.? ? However, 
very shortly it will be housed on our own  server.? So in the future you will 
be able to reach us at http://www.Bid4me.com
?
The site is password restricted so please be advised that  the:
?
login is:angels
password is: engelsev1
?
Note also the login/password is case sensitive
?
http://www.stanford.edu/~zpogue/bid4me/
?
If you double-click on the section 'For angel's eyes only' you will find  our 
current business plan and financials.? Our financials were written by  two 
CPAs in London.
?
You might be interested to know that aside from just  developing our alpha 
website we currently have a small team from Stanford  University ( including 
three PhDs) working on developing our alpha  prototype.
?
Brio, Inc have recently agreed to furnish us, for a trial  period, with their 
software licences (Brio explorer and Brio designer).?  The licence fees are 
usually $5,000.
?
Edgar.com have permitted us to have a free trail of their software.
?
We are looking for at least $1.5mm to launch Bid4me.? If  you have any 
interest in funding us or in working with us in the future I would  be very 
interested to hear your feedback. 
?
Last thing: as we are still in the process of applying for a  patent I would 
appreciate your discretion.? Please do not forward this  password-restricted 
website to anyone outside of Enron Corp.
?
Kind regards 
?
Sebastian Elliot

"Re: RedMeteor.com","we currently have nothing working with redmeteor.   i have spoken with 
dicosmo a couple of times, but he has never seemed interested in persuing 
anything.  we would be willing to discuss an arrangement where enron posts 
some of its prices directly from EOL to redmeteor, but i question whether his 
technology is up to it.  we are entering into arrangements like this with 
other trading platforms.  there is certainly no reason to avoid talking to 
them, but i would suggest a conversation with Andy Zipper on the EOL team.  
he is the one that is handling these types of deals.  i will also forward 
your message to him.

thanks for the heads up

John,
     I had lunch today with David Ownby (plus, Brent Larsen and Michael Chang 
of RedMeteor.com).   David suggested that perhaps there could be some sort of 
arrangement between RedMeteor.com and EOL wherein each could benefit from the 
other's platform.  He was referring specifically to the refined products and 
crude oil areas (where they are primarily physical and we are primarily 
financial).  I am under the impression that there may have been some contact 
earlier this year between Enron management and Vincent Di Cosimo of RedMeteor 
and I had heard the names of Greg Whalley and John Sherriff mentioned in that 
regard.  Is that correct and did anything ever materialize?
     As you know RedMeteor and Vitol are in the process of formalizing a 
strategic alliance to ""aid in their positioning in the global marketplace"" as 
reported in the media.  And the person involved from Vitol, Mike Loya, is a 
person that I have known for years, but have not discussed this topic with 
him.  Is there anything worth pursuing with RedMeteor?
Regards,
Mike

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to ""soak up liquidity"" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

""Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself,"" said 
Altra's Coleman. ""But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another."" 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply ""providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace."" 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the ""Big Brother"" 
of the energy marketplace. 

""The historical information is not available,"" EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
""We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well."" He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

"Physical Power Volumes - 1st Q99 vs 1st Q00","Jim,

Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from 
Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 
1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase 
and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.

Please advise.

Subject: Keynote feedback


Greg,

Your keynote address hit the nail on the head this morning; it has already
spawned constructive discussions and debates, such as what services will the
core exchange(s) offer, what are secondary and tertiary strategies, and how
will various companies in the value chain support and benefit from the
exchanges.  One editor commented that your presentation offered stark
contrast to the Chevron presentation during lunch, which was a much more
passive ""bring the horse to water"" approach.  Tomorrow and Thursday's
presentations will address many of your points more fully.

Thank you very much for taking the time to drive out.  I realize how
difficult carving a morning from your schedule can be.  However, the
industry benefited from your insights.  Hopefully, Enron Net Works will
receive some high-quality prospects and/or recruits in return.

Yours sincerely,

EnronOnline Market Power Under Fire

The simmering pot of market concerns regarding the market power of 
EnronOnline finally boiled over in public yesterday at Chicago's LDC Forum. A 
representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from 
competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron 
the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over 
competitors. 

Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary 
systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of 
large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry 
because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own 
independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic 
competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers 
trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On 
EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every 
transaction. 

The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market 
manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last 
November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. 

Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one 
of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and 
trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged 
that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of 
the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available 
only to Enron. 

EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion 
since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions 
every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online 
business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. 

Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and 
there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. 
There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a 
transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a 
broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is 
supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other 
systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price 
discovery of EnronOnline. 

Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to ""soak up liquidity"" in the 
marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its 
competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about 
its competitors' positions in the market. 

""Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself,"" said 
Altra's Coleman. ""But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough 
of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one 
direction or another."" 

EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply ""providing a 
service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think 
Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out 
there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to 
sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market 
manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the 
marketplace."" 

When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the 
system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of 
its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the ""Big Brother"" 
of the energy marketplace. 

""The historical information is not available,"" EnronOnline's Shults admitted. 
""We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now 
providing that information to the market so everyone else has that 
information as well."" He said Enron does not retain information about those 
who use its system. 

Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market 
much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With 
increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide 
commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the 
Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. 

Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted 
electronic exchange revenues could grow from $500 billion this year to more 
than $3 trillion in 2004-2005.

I'm Liz Taylor, Greg Whalley's Admin. Assistant.  We have spoken a few times 
in the past.  I have just a few questions concerning the event on December 13:


When in the evening will Greg give his speech?
Who long is he scheduled to speak?
Are you wanting him to have a slide presentation or just talk?  He promises 
to be entertaining (smile).  He really is a greater speaker, if I may say so.
What is the dress code?

Let's talk! 

Hey Greg! It was terrific seeing you and Mary at the wedding (thought I wish 
I had spent more time talking to Mary). Now that I'm back in the office, I 
thought I'd send you this invitation to talk.  In theory, as long as you are 
using Windows, it should work, though I've had recent reports of some 
problems with Netscape.  When you get a mic and you think I might be on-line 
at work, just click the link below, agree to the certificate, and we should 
be connected. If it doesn't work, I'll have to call you to walk you through a 
demo of our other stuff. Let me know. Take care, Henri P.S.  Ulrich is still 
so *serious*!

Greg has decided that he would like to do the 90-minute panel.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor

To: <Greg.Whalley@enron.com>
cc:  
Subject: RE: FW: Interactive Energy Keynote Session


Liz,

We're considering one of two options:

In the first, Greg would make an independent 20 to 25-minute presentation
followed with 10 to 15 minutes of Q&A. Tim Ling, chairman of TradeRanger,
will open the keynote session at 8:10 with a discussion of the evolution of
his procurement hub and how he and his senior management team intend to
manage fourteen disparate buying organizations through one e-marketplace
representing $120 billion in annual spending.  Tim will be followed by a
McKinsey director, likely to be Ron Hulme or Scott Nyquist, who will discuss
e-business strategy conclusions that McKinsey has drawn concerning the
energy industry.  Greg will then follow in the lineup depending on whether
we start upstream and move down, or vice versa.  We finish at 11:00.

In the second option, Greg would participate in a 90-minute panel with two
to three other executives and moderated by the director from McKinsey. Under
this scenario, Ling opens and is followed by the McKinsey presentation.  The
director then will moderate a panel of three to four executives: Greg; John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP; Greg Vesey, head of e-business at
Texaco; and/or Brad Kitterman, VP North America, Schlumberger Resource
Management Services.   Each executive would have 10-15 minutes to discuss
his business model and the key issues that the industry must consider during
the next year, followed by Q&A to the entire panel.

Let me know if Greg has a preference to one of these two scenarios and we'll
try to accommodate it.

About the audience:
The audience is consistently made up of a confluence of energy and
technology executives.  About 30% will be comprised of energy professionals
interested in wholesale and retail trading.  For example, we already have
some 70 European gas and electricity executives scheduled to attend.
Cisco's London Office is arranging a Pan American tour for these executives
with a stop at Interactive Energy. Many other wholesale and retail merchants
will also be in attendance, including some large industrial buyers.  Heads
of energy procurement from Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall's (an
eight-state buying consortium's) have attended in the past.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,

Bob

Dear Greg:

To follow with my phone message, please consider accepting a keynote speech
for Interactive Energy, Tuesday morning, Oct. 24, in Houston. We've
confirmed either the head of the E-Commerce Practice or the North American
Energy Practice from McKinsey and have issued invitations to Tim Ling, the
chairman of TradeRanger (the Shell, BP, Unocal procurement hub), and John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP.

Interactive Energy has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
e-strategy event (see www.interactiveenergy.com).  Skilling gave the
keynote
last year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents
from
Halliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote
session.  More than 1,450 executives attended.  Given the large number of
early registrations and the strong program, we expect this year's to be
much
larger.

Ideally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and
describe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and
objectives in this area.  The target audience for the conference is senior
energy management who are integrating technology into their core business
strategies.

Interactive Energy 2000, which will have more than 100 speakers, will cover
technology development across five sectors:

1) Upstream
2) Transportation & Logistics
3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)
4) Wholesale
5) Retail

Press Coverage:
The conference has been a high priority for the trade press as well as the
general media.  At previous years' events, we had editors from more than
twenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street
Journal, FT Energy, Oil & Gas Journal, Oil & Gas Investor, World Oil,
Bloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.  National
Public
Radio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.  As
result of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,
including Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil & Gas Investor, Houston Business
Journal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,
Energy Commerce and others.

Benefits:

Enron Net Works will benefit in four ways:

?    First, you will educate customers and partners.  Cisco is bringing
some 70
senior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most
interested in your perspectives.  Energy buyers from such organizations as
Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium)
have
attended in previous years.

?    Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba,
Luminant,
IBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron's
vision.

?    Third, you will educate employees.  Some 43 executives from Enron
attended
last year's event.

?    Fourth, you will persuade recruits.  Capable professionals in this
area
are in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of
Enron's innovations and rapid growth.

I hope that your calendar is clear.  Look forward to the possibility of
working with you and your staff.  I'll call to follow up.

Yours respectfully,

"Re: FW: Enron Everywhere","don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing 
power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in 
oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in 
Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our 
fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring 
into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in 
EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are 
setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping 
origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you 
make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in 
the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's 
and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, 
structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are 
pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an 
Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant 
development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan 
or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our 
projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call 
Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

"fractional","the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair 
will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly 
rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or 
capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of 
them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a 
big plane.

I was talking about you and Jay to the guys here the other day and telling

Subject:  Keynote feedback


Greg,

Your keynote address hit the nail on the head this morning; it has already
spawned constructive discussions and debates, such as what services will
the
core exchange(s) offer, what are secondary and tertiary strategies, and how
will various companies in the value chain support and benefit from the
exchanges.  One editor commented that your presentation offered stark
contrast to the Chevron presentation during lunch, which was a much more
passive ""bring the horse to water"" approach.  Tomorrow and Thursday's
presentations will address many of your points more fully.

Thank you very much for taking the time to drive out.  I realize how
difficult carving a morning from your schedule can be.  However, the
industry benefited from your insights.  Hopefully, Enron Net Works will
receive some high-quality prospects and/or recruits in return.

Yours sincerely,

Bob Nimocks

We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, 
given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe 
Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and 
reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount 
to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 
(US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Greg has committed to participate in the conference.  Give me until

Many Thanks,

Liz

To: <Greg.Whalley@enron.com>

Subject: RE: FW: Interactive Energy Keynote Session


Liz,

We're considering one of two options:

In the first, Greg would make an independent 20 to 25-minute presentation
followed with 10 to 15 minutes of Q&A. Tim Ling, chairman of TradeRanger,
will open the keynote session at 8:10 with a discussion of the evolution of
his procurement hub and how he and his senior management team intend to
manage fourteen disparate buying organizations through one e-marketplace
representing $120 billion in annual spending.  Tim will be followed by a
McKinsey director, likely to be Ron Hulme or Scott Nyquist, who will discuss
e-business strategy conclusions that McKinsey has drawn concerning the
energy industry.  Greg will then follow in the lineup depending on whether
we start upstream and move down, or vice versa.  We finish at 11:00.

In the second option, Greg would participate in a 90-minute panel with two
to three other executives and moderated by the director from McKinsey. Under
this scenario, Ling opens and is followed by the McKinsey presentation.  The
director then will moderate a panel of three to four executives: Greg; John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP; Greg Vesey, head of e-business at
Texaco; and/or Brad Kitterman, VP North America, Schlumberger Resource
Management Services.   Each executive would have 10-15 minutes to discuss
his business model and the key issues that the industry must consider during
the next year, followed by Q&A to the entire panel.

Let me know if Greg has a preference to one of these two scenarios and we'll
try to accommodate it.

About the audience:
The audience is consistently made up of a confluence of energy and
technology executives.  About 30% will be comprised of energy professionals
interested in wholesale and retail trading.  For example, we already have
some 70 European gas and electricity executives scheduled to attend.
Cisco's London Office is arranging a Pan American tour for these executives
with a stop at Interactive Energy. Many other wholesale and retail merchants
will also be in attendance, including some large industrial buyers.  Heads
of energy procurement from Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall's (an
eight-state buying consortium's) have attended in the past.

Please let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,

Bob

Greg,
Certainly hope you can join us for the keynote session to describe one
year's experience with EOL and what's in store next.  Tim Ling, chairman of
TradeRanger -- the fourteen-company procurement consortium with BP Amoco,
Shell, Unocal, Total Fina and others -- has confirmed.  Still working with
the others.

Vice Chairman & CEO, Enron Net Works LLC
Managing Director, Enron Corp.
PO Box 1188
Houston, TX  77251-1188

VIA E-MAIL: WHALLEY@ENRON.COM


Dear Greg:

To follow with my phone message, please consider accepting a keynote speech
for Interactive Energy, Tuesday morning, Oct. 24, in Houston. We've
confirmed either the head of the E-Commerce Practice or the North American
Energy Practice from McKinsey and have issued invitations to Tim Ling, the
chairman of TradeRanger (the Shell, BP, Unocal procurement hub), and John
Leggate, Group Vice President, IT at BP.

Interactive Energy has grown to be the largest and most prestigious
e-strategy event (see www.interactiveenergy.com).  Skilling gave the
keynote
last year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents
from
Halliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote
session.  More than 1,450 executives attended.  Given the large number of
early registrations and the strong program, we expect this year's to be
much
larger.

Ideally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and
describe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and
objectives in this area.  The target audience for the conference is senior
energy management who are integrating technology into their core business
strategies.

Interactive Energy 2000, which will have more than 100 speakers, will cover
technology development across five sectors:

1) Upstream
2) Transportation & Logistics
3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)
4) Wholesale
5) Retail

Press Coverage:
The conference has been a high priority for the trade press as well as the
general media.  At previous years' events, we had editors from more than
twenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street
Journal, FT Energy, Oil & Gas Journal, Oil & Gas Investor, World Oil,
Bloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.  National
Public
Radio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.  As
result of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,
including Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil & Gas Investor, Houston Business
Journal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,
Energy Commerce and others.

Benefits:

Enron Net Works will benefit in four ways:

?    First, you will educate customers and partners.  Cisco is bringing
some 70
senior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most
interested in your perspectives.  Energy buyers from such organizations as
Ford, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium)
have
attended in previous years.

?    Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba,
Luminant,
IBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron's
vision.

?    Third, you will educate employees.  Some 43 executives from Enron
attended
last year's event.

?    Fourth, you will persuade recruits.  Capable professionals in this
area
are in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of
Enron's innovations and rapid growth.

I hope that your calendar is clear.  Look forward to the possibility of
working with you and your staff.  I'll call to follow up.

Yours respectfully,

Bob Nimocks

Subject: Enron At A Glance Interview Questions - Thursday

Here is the agenda...

Enron At A Glance is an opportunity for 3-6 month employees to learn 
information about the individual business units.  March 1st will mark the 
third edition of the newly designed orientation.  Based on audience feedback, 
the New Hire Network Team is searching for creative ways to engage the 
audience and encourage deeper conversation on the stage.  

The Enron Wholesale Interview needs to focus on broad contributions to Enron, 
general business processes, and 2001 goals. Most of the wholesale business 
units have sent speakers to discuss their specific commodities, goals, and  
contributions to EWS.
Enron Networks  Beth Perlman
Enron Industrial Markets Tammy Mulrooney
Enron Global Markets Mike McConnell
You may notice Enron Americas and Europe are not included.  Their speakers 
are unavailable.  Thus, I will ask questions about the gas and power industry 
as well as examples of initiatives in Europe.  
We will also follow your interview with several pre-recorded interviews with 
lead commodity traders (i.e. Hunter Shively, Janet Dietrich, Dave Duran, 
etc).  They will focus on the trading responsibilities.

I will be interviewing you on stage.  During your interview, we will be 
interrupted by ""Late Breaking News"" concerning power peaker issues and 
describing how Enron makes money with this initiative.  This is a 4-5 minute 
pre-recorded video that runs on the screens behind our interview area.  You 
will not need to contribute anything to this video.

Here are the questions I have written.  Please give your feedback.

(1)  Greg, you came to Enron in 1992 while the gas market was deregulating 
and the power market was moving towards deregulation.  Tell us what you 
experienced during this time.
 (a)  What risks did Enron take then?
 (b)  Did the Enron leaders have a real idea of amount of opportunities that 
would open the gas and power markets?
 (c)  What was the atmosphere at Enron during this time?  Excitement?  
Frustration?  High Egos?
 (d)  Do you think that EES and EBS are experiencing the same type of 
excitement while they forge into undiscovered markets?

Interruption:  ENA Investigative Report (Part 1) - Late Breaking News

(2)  In 1996, you moved into the European market and lead the trading 
divisions in the oil and refined products.  
 (a) What was the atmosphere like in the International arena?
 (b)  Has the atmosphere changed over the last 5 years?
 (c)  What are some initiatives that are hot in Europe?

(3)   Enron is entering the Japanese market.  They are focusing on the power, 
foreign exchange and metal markets.
 (a)  What are their goals in these markets?
 (b)  What are their challenges this year?  in the next 3 years?
 (c)  What other opportunities area arising in Japan?

(4)  Enron Wholesale Services was created and announced in November 2000.
 (a)  What was the business purpose for this formation?
 (b)  What accomplishments/successes  have been made already?
 (c)  What is the business model for EWS?
 (d)  What characteristics does a market need to interest EWS?

(5)  Finally, EWS and its business units have been losing its intellectual 
capital, its people resources, to the other divisions of Enron such as EBS 
and EES.  
 (a)  What characteristics are you looking for in future employees
 (b)  Recruiting is offering a $5000 incentive to Enron employees referring 
people with trading skills.  What are your needs in this area?

Conclusion of interview:  You will exit the stage while I set up the audience 
for Part 2 of the Investigative Report.  Thanks for your time.

"Re:","call liz and get on my calendar.  maybe we can grab lunch or something.  i 
heard about the ag meeting.  sounds like things could have gone better, but 
it also sounds like jeff was a little difficult.  he never has liked the 
notion of that business though.  i'll try to explain it next week.
