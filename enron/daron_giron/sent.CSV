I was traveling on Friday.  The Doubletree is the closest.  I'll get you a number.  Dinner on Monday is a good idea.  If you have a 5:30pm flight, leaving the office at 3:00pm will give you enough time to return a car and get to the terminal.

Is the closest hotel to the Enron office the Doubletree?  Do you have an
address or phone number?

I was thinking that perhaps we should plan to have dinner on Monday evening.
This would be a good opportunity to get acquainted.  Are you available?
Please let me know as we have not made our airline reservations.

I think we will take the 5:30 flight back to Minneapolis.  I assume that we
should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we
need to leave earlier?

   works
   best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere

   Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place

   Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

"RE: taxes","The current exemption is $675,000.  So that means that the first $675,000 of an estate is tax free.  Anything over that is taxed at 55%, but you are allowed deductions such as debts, probate fees, funeral expenses, and any state estate or inheritance taxes.  So the effective rate will be a little lower.  The increase to $1 million will not take effect until 2006.  This is very basic information, estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability.  Obviously, if the estate is not worth much money, then no taxes will be owed.  I'm sure these professionals are highly compensated because they have the ability to save millions of dollars to some of their clients.

"RE: BCS","We are going to Dallas.  I bought the tickets the week of the OU game.  Thought I would be selling them until last Sat evening.  I think a 5% chance at Pasadena.  I think it comes down to Miami-VT.  Florida should cruise at home against Tenn and anyone in the SEC west on the carpet in Atlanta.  But stranger things have happened........

ANYONE REMEMBER THIS??
IT WAS 1987!
At a UNC lecture the other day they played an old video
of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during
the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country
getting the third degree. But what he said was stunning!! He was being
drilled by some senator;

""Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home
security system?""
Ollie replied, ""Yes I did sir.""
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the
audience, ""Isn't this just a little excessive?""
'No sir,' continued Ollie.
""No? And why not?"" the senator asked.
""Because the lives of my family and I were threatened
sir.""
'Threatened? By whom?"" the senator questioned.
'By a terrorist, sir.' Ollie answered.
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that
much?""
""His name is Osama bin Laden sir."" Ollie replied.

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

""Why are you so afraid of this man?"" the senator asked.
""Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I
know of,"" Ollie answered.
""And what do you recommend we do about him?"" asked the
senator.
""Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that
an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
the earth.""

The senator disagreed with this approach and that was
all that was shown
of the clip.

Osama  Goes To Hell
One day in the future, Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies.  He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him. 
""I  don't know what to do here,"" says the devil. ""You are on my list, but I have  no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm  going to do. I've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you.  I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU  decide who leaves."" 
Osama thought that sounded pretty good, so he  agreed. The devil opened the first room; in it was Richard Nixon and a large  pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed -- over and over  and over. Such was his fate in hell. 
""No,"" bin Laden said. ""I don't  think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day  long."" 
The devil led him to the next room; in it was Tony Blair with a  sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hamm! er,  time after time after time. 
""No, I've got this problem with my  shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all  day,"" commented Osama bin Laden. 
The devil opened a third door. In it,  Osama saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head,  and his legs staked in a spread eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky,  doing what she does best. 
Osama bin Laden looked at this in disbelief  for a while and finally said, ""Yeah, I can handle this."" 
The devil  smiled and said, ""OK, Monica, you're free to go.""

This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

"RE: Saturday","I bought the tickets the week of the Texas-OU game.  Up until Sat night, I was planning on selling them to a guy I work with who went to OU.  I never thought about a hotel because I really never thought UT would be in the game.  I really don't want to put you guys out, especially with a new baby.  We are bringing Christopher (he is really excited about going) and a high school aged neighbor (his girlfriend's brother is on the team).  If you truly don't mind, then I will talk to Kristi about it.  We'll see.  How's the new house?  Is Flower Mound a little west of Lewisville?  I'm not good on Dallas geography.

tEXas tailgatES talk

Okay, I have come off of the ledge. I thought about a
lot of things when I was out there: what if the punt
was tipped, what if it was a safety, what in the world
was going through Gary Barnett's mind on that fake punt,
what if the field goal was good, wow, it's really high
up here... Mostly I thought this: no more Dallas. Let's
not play any more games in the DFW area, nothing good
happens. We will meet the Okies in Waco and play'em at
Baylor. Who's going to mind?
Certainly not the Bears (they really don't use the field
much any way) and certainly not me.

39-37

If you were a 3rd party observer, this game was probably
very exciting. Texas goes up early, Colorado roars ahead
at half, and Texas fights back, but falls just short. I
AM NOT a 3rd party observer. The Horns were so close. 2
points away from a Big XII Championship. D'oh! Give the
Buffaloes their credit, they brought that nasty running
game that we all thought was an aberration vs. Nebraska.
Chris Brown looked liked he was 9 feet tall (have you
ever seen a guy run higher than him? He makes Eddie George
look like a hunchback It was like watching Michael Johnson
sprint) and the CU o-line was just evil. 3 or 4 of those
guys will be playing on Sundays next year. On defense, the
'horns lack of size showed. It's hard to stop a power
running game that's clicking with small tackles, or even
big ones- ask Nebraska, and quick defensive ends. To their
credit, the Texas defense did not fold, but fought the
good fight and stemmed the tide, holding CU to 10 points
in the 2nd half. The 1st half was the killer.  The 1st half.
Oh. The Horns looked great to start the game, but things
went wrong. Chris Simms didn't play well, and would be the
1st to tell you that it was his worst game at Texas so far.
3 interceptions and 1 fumble. Ouch. Cedric Benson was
running well, 13 carries for 79 yards and a score, before
he was hurt with a pinched nerve. The 'horns got down 29-10
and it looked like they would be blown out (that's sort of
how the OU game in 2000 started), but they refused to die,
and fought back to near even. Major Applewhite went from
cult hero to certified legend by throwing a 79 yd touchdown
pass on his 2nd play after replacing an injured Simms, and
Texas nearly pulled it out, but was too far back in the
long run.  I want to talk about Simms for a second. It would
be absurd to say that those 4 turnovers weren't the main
reason Texas lost. It was. Chris played badly. Horrible.
There is no other way to say it. He is a big boy, and I am
quite sure he has the mental toughness to hear this
(and I'm sure he has) and learn from it. It was not your
day, Lefty, turn the page and move on. Everybody has them.
Ty Detmer threw 7 picks in 1 game this year. Kurt Warner had
4 v. the Saints. You will no doubt have more of those when
you get to the League in 2003. There is no shame in playing
bad, as long as you learn something from it. You had 2 bad
days in '01, but you also had 10 good ones, and 3 or 4 great
ones. Get that 2 down to 1 next year, and you will hear no
complaints from me; of course I'm not speaking for everyone...

I thought the coaches called a good game. Greg Davis opened
up the playbook with some reverses and deep middle-stuff,
and Carl Reese was working up-hill most of the night and
still held CU to 111 passing and 334 total. The blocked
punt call, in my opinion, was a good call. Texas got one
at A&M, and needed some help at that point. To ask the Horns
to go 80 + yards through the air (there was no Benson, so
no running game) with your big tackle (Mike Williams) out
of the game would have been a tall order. Get the block, and
you set up shop at mid-field or even run it back for 6.
They didn't get the block, obviously. Teams call the punt-block
all of the time, but don't hit the kicker. The kid for Texas
missed the punt by 2 inches, but fell into the CU punter.
1st down. Tough break. Hindsight is 20/20, but I would call
it again.

___________________________________________________
tEXas tailgate-
is in the works. It will not be the traditional tailgate
like last year, but more of a gathering somewhere (like a
bar, restaurant or hotel) before we all head to the stadium.
Another email will follow as soon as it is set up.

Travel packages

The Texas Exes are hosting a trip to San Diego. Please click

___________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Major Applewhite will start the Holiday Bowl.
* Cedric got his 1,000. Benson only played a half, but his
79 yards put him at 1,053 yards for the year. He is the 9th
player to rush for a grand at Texas.
* Major Applewhite's 233 yards passing give him 8,059 career
yards, breaking the all-time record of 8,049
(James Brown, 1994-97).
* The Vapor is good. Nathan Vasher tied a school record with
7 interceptions in a season. He also had 54 yards in punt
returns, giving him 554 for the year, breaking the school
record of 538 (Johnnie Johnson - 1977).
* B.J. Johnson's 79 yard touchdown catch was his 4th reception
of 70 + yards. All have been touchdowns. B.J. had his 1st
2 t.d. game, and his 4th 100-yard game.
* D.D. Lewis started his 50th consecutive game Saturday,
breaking the school record of 49 held by Dan Neil (1993-1996).
* Hats off to Alfio Randall. The Big Cat filled in for an
injured Mike Williams, and did not let his man touch Applewhite.
* The home team is 6-0 in Big XII Championship games. The home team
is the one who travels the farthest, and usually is outnumbered
in the stands.
* Through their first 15 starts, Major Applewhite and Chris Simms
have identical 12-3 records.

Around the Conference:
* Coach Bob lost his offensive coordinator. Mark Mangino
accepted the Head Coaching  job at Kansas. Sorry, Coach Bob.
Mangino should be okay there, if he can recruit.
* 8 bowl teams from the Big XII. That is a conference record.
Here is who they are, where they're going and when they play,
in the order they were picked by the bowls..

COLORADO - BCS v. TBA
NEBRASKA - BCS v. TBA
OKLAHOMA- Cotton Bowl v. SEC team, Jan. 1st
TEXAS- Holiday Bowl v. Washington, Dec. 28th
TEXAS TECH- Alamo Bowl v. Iowa, Dec. 29th
KANSAS STATE- Insight.com Bowl v. Syracuse, Dec. 29th
IOWA STATE- MainStay Independence Bowl v. SEC team, Dec. 27th
TEXAS A&M- Galleryfurniture.com Bowl v. winner of
Southern Mississippi/TCU, Dec. 29th

Next week I will begin breaking down the Holiday Bowl, as
well as the other bowl games (we will know who plays who
next week). Expect another email about
the tailgate coming soon.

See you later, and do not hesitate to let me know what you think!
Most of you already know that...

"Accomplishments","These are the three that came to mind.  I had trouble with my email from home.  Let me know what else I need to do.

Thanks

DG

I managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  It was a two year deal in which Enron was assigned all of the utilities' assets (supply contracts, transportation contracts, and storage contracts) and then became responsible for providing 100% of the gas requirements of BUG.  I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal, mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts.  I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group, our logistics group, our risk management group, and gas accounting group.  In addition, I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues.  It was a $24MM/Year deal.  I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk.

I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago.  I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal.  I also created invoice models.  I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management.  We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago.  I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture.  I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues.  This office made $12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective.

I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a $10MM flash to actual variance in the region.  Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P&L and the GL.  Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them.  On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero.  I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem.  After managing the desk for 6 months, I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books.  This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one, saving the company approx $100K/Year.

Subject:	FW: PROJECT 1

Here is a test of several items you have learned in the Excel class so far.

I have set up a basic program structure for you that opens a file and reads the file, line by line, into the variable ""sBuf"".

You should write functions that tally the results asked for on Sheet1  (number of lines in the file, number of characters, etc).  A user should be able to enter a search (source) string.  Given the string you should also search for how many times it occurs in the file under 3 different conditions (case-sensitive, case-insensitive and as a ""word"" - separated by blanks).

You should have all the basic concepts down to complete the program fairly easily.  Work on this project and we will discuss it on the Monday following Thanksgiving.

I will be out tomorrow and next week.

Have fun!

"RE: Texas","Sorry to hear that.  I hope everything goes well at work.  My company is crumbling.  It's pretty scary.  A combination of being too far out of downtown and too many trees meant that I couldn't get a good signal.  I ended up getting a cable modem.  I really didn't want to do that because I absolutely hate Time Warner.  And what do you know, they screwed up my first bill.

Hey Darron,
I don't think I'm going to be able to make it down for the game.  My
department just went through a big lay off, everyone got let go but me,
so I'm pretty busy right now trying to make sure the transition goes ok.
I was thinking about trying to take some time off over the holidays,
making my way down to Dallas and LA.  If schedules work out, maybe we
could arrange a visit then.  I'm really sorry.  I was looking forward to
seeing you and the family, enjoy watching KU get beat really bad... but
the timing just really stinks.

We definitely want to go skiing.  Most likely in the spring.  I may have to wait and see how this thing plays out though.  I am going to Dallas on Saturday and we may stay at your sisters place.

What's up?  I do not know if your  mother told you, but Tracie and I are expecting in June!  We are very  excited.
 
I know it is probably a sore subject, but  what the hell is going on with Enron?  Are you looking for another job or  are you not effected?
 
Let me know if you guys are planning to  go skiing again this year.  I will keep my eyes open for deals.  
 
I'll talk to you later and watch out for  those Buffaloes on Saturday night!

I have created the Twister termination and will get Fred LaGrasta to sign it this afternoon. (we're not allowed to sign financial terminations down here)

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

"RE: What's up","I didn't go to Colorado.  My son had a baseball game and I had been out of town over the weekends lately so we sold the tickets.  They did look pretty good, and could have really blown them out if Sims had been just a little more accurate in the second half.  But I'm not complaining.  I think Brown really made a mistake by going with Ivan Williams against OK.  He is just too slow hitting the hole against a defense like that.  I think the next three are locks.  Then it comes down to T+1.  I don't care how average they may be, UT has won exactly 1 game at Kyle since 1983 (8 games).  Texas should be very good next year.  The only problem area I see is the OL.  I just sent an email to Kyle about lunch.  Let's do it.

ENE is a piece of shit.  That's really all there is to say about that.

Did you go to the game this weekend?    UT looked strong after the first
20min.  Hopefully Neb. and Tech can beat OU.  The A&M game looks like it
could be more of a challenge than I had originally thought.    What's going
on at Enron?  I saw where the SEC will be investigating an Enron
partership.  What's your take on the situation there?

Let's go to lunch soon.

"RE: Season tix are in","I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4 season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.  I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my records
of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you paid
me?

When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and OU
or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than your
season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix with
their season tix.

I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

We'll get it worked out

I just got the tickets.  Thanks for sending them.  I paid for 4 OU tickets,
could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you about the
possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.  I know you
get quite a few each year, but don't know if you have extras available.
Thanks again.

   It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll probably
   just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of
   the
   NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this with
   you
   next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word on

thanks.  I'll look at the PGL deals in a few minutes

We think we may have found part of the problem.  We believe that the problem may be in the way we booked annuities to zero Nov & Dec activity for NSS year 3.  I would like to bounce it off you when we pull all the info together.

Once we correct the problem, we need to change Jan for EMW and enovate.  Phyllis said it was not too late.  Do you know of any reason that we couldn't restate Jan today?

I'll call you later.

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I was supposed to be traveling this morning, but because of the crash in NY it has been postponed to tomorrow.  I will be in a Dallas airport at the time of our call tomorrow morning.  Should I use 763-241-2490 as the number to use for our conference call?  If not, let me know.  I look forward to our conversation.  Thanks

Subject: christmas traditions
Subject: I have always questioned this  tradition
Some Christmass traditions have roots where we would least  expect them.
Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his  annual
trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got  sick,
and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the  regular
ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being  behind
schedule.
Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her Mom was coming to  visit. This
stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer,  he found
that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the  fence
and were out, heaven knows where to. More Stress! Then when he began  to
load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to  the
ground and scattered the toys.
Totally frustrated, Santa went into  the house for a cup of coffee and
shot of whiskey. When he went to the  cupboard, he found the elves
had hit the liquor and there was nothing to  drink. In his frustration,
he dropped the coffee pot and it broke into  hundreds of little pieces
all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the  broom and found that
mice had eaten the straw it was made from.
Just  then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.
He opened the  door and there was a little angel with a great big
Christmas tree The angel  said: ""Where would you like to put this tree
fat man?""
And that my  friend... is how the little angel came to be on top of the
Christmas  tree.
HO, HO,  HO...

"Colorado","I think Phillip is dead serious about trying to start a business.  Enron's stock is down sharply again today.  It's trading at $16.  Remember in March we got out at $71.  My options are now $68 out of the money and it will be at least 3 years before they will approach breakeven.  If I seem depressed lately, that's why.  Anyway, I love you.

Read all the way to the end or you will miss out.

A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of
him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise
jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2"" in diameter. He then
asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was.

So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the
jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open
areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was
full. They agreed it was. The students laughed.

The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course,
the sand filled up everything else. ""Now,"" said the professor, ""I want you
to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things -
your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if
everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be
full.

The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your
car. The sand is everything else. The small stuff.""

""If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or
the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and
energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are
important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your
happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take
your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the
house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal.""

""Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your
priorities. The rest is just sand.""

But then... A particularly adept student took the jar which the other
students and the professor agreed was full, and proceeded to pour in a glass
of beer. Of course the beer filled the remaining spaces within the jar
making the jar truly full.

The student said "" You know, no matter how full your life is of big and
small things, there is always room in it for BEER.""

tEXas tailgatES talk


We will all need to chip in a few dollars for the ENORMOUS
thank you card going to Stillwater this week. I gave the
Cowboys no chance to win that game, and after seeing the
highlights, reading the paper, etc? I still would give them
no chance. It just goes to show that what I think means
absolutely nothing.

21-7

Wow. This game was eerily similar to the Texas/OU game. Both
defense were stellar, and shutdown the opposition's offense.
Some complaints I have heard center on the lack of offense/offensive
creativity in the A&M game, and Chris Simms' decision making
in the passing game. I disagree. If you were at the game, you
noticed the wind was swirling something fierce, and gusting
upwards of around 30 mph at times. Both punters struggled in
the 1st half, with punts of 15,17,19,17,21 and 24 yards. Aggie
qb Mark Farris threw deep a few times, and was picked off once,
and if not for some superb plays by his wr's, at least twice more.
Texas jumped out early with a t.d off of a blocked punt, and then
went into the play-it-safe mode. Seeing that balls thrown deep
were floating up for grabs and the Aggie offense's inability to
move the ball consistently, the Longhorns played the OU-style
field position game, and kept the crowd out of it (except for
the 39-yard punt return by Mickey Jones in the 3rd quarter, when
Texas te Mike Jones was liquidated on a block) and eventually
wore down the undermanned Aggies with 2 scores late in the 4th.
Could the offense have played better? Sure. They would certainly
be the first to tell you that. Simms, in my opinion, did exactly
what the coaches asked him to do: play it safe, don't go for the
home run, and don't give them anything cheap to fire up the crowd.
He did just that. No turnovers, no silly passes (well, 1). His
touch seemed a little off, throwing behind some receivers on
occasion, but he also looked fantastic in the clutch. He fired a
missile between 2 Aggies to hit Bo Scaife on 3rd & 4 at the Aggie
15 on the games go ahead touchdown drive (Benson scored on the
next play). He took what the defense gave him, and now the 'horns
are in Dallas. Fine with me. A 14-point win at the feared Kyle
Field.  The Texas Defense is ON FIRE. They held the inept Aggie
offense to 165 yards total (117 pass: 48 rush) and 1 touchdown.
A&M Aggie qb Mark Farris was never able to find his receivers,
and twice found Longhorn defenders wide open. Neither offense
looked particularly sharp, but the 'horns found a way to pull
it out. Good teams win. Period.
_________________________________________________
THE BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
Texas vs. Colorado
7:00 PM
ABC

Ask and ye shall receive. Here we are. The Longhorns come in
10-1, Winners of the south (thanks, Pokes) and CU comes in 8-2,
claiming the north title. These two unexpected opponents know
each other pretty well. Texas beat the Buffs, 41-7, back on
Oct. 27th in Austin. CU looked a little lost that day, and Texas
pounced on them and wore them down. These are not your October
Buffalos, folks. This team has found itself, and is brimming
with confidence after they thumped Nebraska, 62-36. Put it away,
Buffs, you get the Burnt Orange this week.  Keys for the game:
Texas needs to stop the run (understatement of the year). The
Longhorns will put 8 and 9 in the box to stop the quartet of CU
backs, and dare Bobby Pesavento to beat them. CU has, in my
opinion, the best tight end in college football in Daniel Graham.
He could not be stopped when they met the Huskers, and single
handedly kept the Nebraska db's from crowding the line of
scrimmage. Daniel, this is Nathan Vasher. On offense, Texas will
look for the pass to open the run. Colorado has a suspect
secondary, and the 'horns will try to exploit that with the UT
Towers. If this happens, look for Texas to run well in the 2nd
half.

tEXas tailgate
We are having a tEXas tailgate. It will be located at the
University of Dallas, right across the street from Texas
Stadium. It will begin at 2:00 pm. This seems a little early,
but tickets ordered from the Longhorn Foundation will be picked
up at will call at Gate 10 at Texas Stadium. So you can come by
for a beer and a bbq sandwich, go get your tickets at will call,
and come back for another beer and a sausage wrap, and another
beer? you get the idea.

IT WILL BE FREE OF CHARGE.

That's right. Free. All food and beer will be on a cash basis
(food includes sausage wraps, bbq sandwiches, nachos).
Below is a map to the area around Texas Stadium. The star
represents the U of D campus. There is a pedestrian walkway
from the campus to Texas Stadium.

News and Notes:
* Ced will get his crack at 1,000. The Big XII Championship counts
as a regular season game, so Ced will have another chance to break
RW's record for freshman rushing. Ricky had 12 games his freshman
year, too. He needs 16 yards for the 1,000.
* Benson also set the record freshman touchdowns with his 2 vs. the
Aggies. He has 12 (11 rush/1receiving), breaking Roy Willams' record
of 10 set in 2000.
* Chris Simms passed for 138 yards, giving him 2,473 for the year.
That's 2nd on the all-time list for single season passing yards at
Texas. Unless something really strange happens, that's where he'll
stay. Major holds the record with 3,357 yards (1999).
* Rod Babers blocked his 2nd kick of the season Friday, resulting
in a touchdown after Tony Jeffrey scooped it up. Kool-Aid was the
Co-Special Teams Player of the Week in the Big XII for that effort.
* Texas has now won 8 straight road games.
* The Longhorns post their 1st 10-win season since 1995. They got
their 10th at A&M that year, too.
* The Defense had a season high 4 sacks vs. the A&M Aggies.
* CU is 9-2 this year, tied for the most improved team from 2000
to '01. They were 3-8 in '00, and stand at +6.
* The Buffalos averaged 10.4 yards per carry vs. Nebraska. Yikes.
* Buff tailback Cortlen Johnson needs 49 yards receiving to become
CU's all-time leading career receiver for running backs. He has 677,
and trails Herschel Troutman (725)
* Colorado has only given up 13 sacks in 11 games this season.

Around the Conference:
* Colorado. Wow. 62-36. 62 points. The Buffs had 582 yards, 415
yards rushing. All three are records against the Huskers. 4th
string tailback Chris Brown had 7 touchdowns in the game, a CU
record. That might be more than the Aggies had all season. NU
was definitely looking ahead to Dallas, but I guess they can all
go to tv room in the dorm and watch the game together. They blew
a #1 BCS rating and a shot at the title. The broadcast showed
shocked Nebraska fans in the stands, and one little boy crying.
It makes you feel a little sorry for them. Okay, it passed.
* Kansas beat Wyoming, 27-14. Quarterback Mario Kinsey had 221
yards passing and rb Reggie Duncan rushed for 168 yards and 2
touchdowns. There were 6,500 people at the game. 6,500. There
were more people than that trying to get into K-Mart Friday
morning in south Austin.
* K-State whipped Mizzou, 24-3, on tailback Josh Scobey's 198
yards and 2 touchdowns. He has 31 for his short 2-year career,
tying him for the most t.d.'s in KSU history with Mack Herron
(1968-69). Kansas State is the 8th bowl eligible team in the
Big XII.
* Iowa State beat Iowa, 17-14, in their rivalry game to finish
the year at 7-4. It's the 1st time ever a class of ISU seniors
went 4-0 vs. the Hawkeyes. They should always play this game in
November, not in September.
* Baylor beat Southern Illinois, 56-12. Good for you.
* Tech beat Stephen F. Austin, 58-3. Again, good for you.
* Well, well. Sometimes when I write these, there are things
that happen that I enjoy so much, I want to put them off as
long as possible to savor it. This is one of those times. Let
me get this straight- you lost, AT HOME, to a 3-7 team? 3-7.
It must have been some sort of trick play, I guess. A double
reverse pass back to the punter or something? I can't see any
other way that OSU could score with a TRUE FRESHMAN quarterback
guiding that Offense. Sooner db Derrick Straight said after the
game, ""I am in disbelief."" You and me both, D. The Sooner
secondary is supposed to be vicious, but they melted down in the
clutch and gave up 2 bombs in the last minute to find a way to
lose. Coach Bob, you seemed so smug in Lubbock after the Texas
players left the Tech game, saying they ""had to hope their big
brother knocked us off..."" but I guess you forgot about the weak
little sister who just sent you and your legions to Dallas for
New Year's. Bring a coat; it will probably be a little chilly...

That's it for now. The 'horns are 60 minutes from a ring. We need
everybody there to make Dallas our own. Remember, the tailgate
is free, so you should all come.

See you at Christie's on Friday. See you at the tailgate on
Saturday. Let's roll.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity --- Firm Will Pay Debt, Keep Cash Cushion
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R. Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith and Jathon Sapsford

10/26/2001

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity. 
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But, ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor's, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down six cents at $16.35. 
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes more than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999. 
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by underperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, particularly in today's slower economy. 
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealings with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents related to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclosed its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee-related entity known as Chewco. 
Chewco was established in 1997 ""with approximately $400 million in capital commitments"" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the partnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a managing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the document. 
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco. 
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In response to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that ""Michael Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron."" Mr. Fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partnerships in July. 
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regarding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves ""any director or executive officer."" By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumably wouldn't have. 
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a ""material"" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents in charge of major business units and ""other persons who perform similar policy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of management.""

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump
By Theo Francis and Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year. 
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 million through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paired with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. 
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. Lay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, he sold shares for a total of $26 million. 
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales ""a personal decision."" Many sales by Enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises. 
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research director of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on investment ideas. 
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares. 
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment. 
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they sold 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3.4 million shares for $123.1 million. 
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company shares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the company and Mr. Fastow. 
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics says. 
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment. 
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The suit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 million of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Credit-Rating Concerns
By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C15
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse. 
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% drop during the past two weeks. 
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resulting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower. 
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yesterday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in bonds, a small percentage of a typical trade. 
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating concerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer. 
""Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest,"" said Harold Rivkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N.J. 
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a ""default swap"" -- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit being insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lucent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology company's troubles earlier during the year. 
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment-grade level. 
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last week. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of putting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its long-term ratings outlook to ""negative,"" citing concerns about the company's financial flexibility.) 
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst. ""These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels,"" said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an independent fixed-income research firm in New York. ""They aren't distressed yet, but they are headed in that direction."" 
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the company's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments. 
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacity and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets. 
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without that credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derived from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or commodity. 
""Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses,"" said Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. ""Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron's counterparties"" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with Enron -- ""is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credit analysts said. ""I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
""So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them,"" said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's utility energy project finance group. ""No one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have publicly stated that it's business as usual."" 
Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Treasurys 
Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week's flood of Treasury, corporate and agency debt issues. 
At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4.588% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. 
The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield 5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday. 
Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6. Also providing support for longer maturities, the Treasury Department made another repurchase of issues outstanding. It received offers for $5.04 billion in callable 30-year bonds, of which it accepted $1 billion. The offer-to-cover ratio, an indication of demand, was 5.04.

Motorola Inc.'s offering of three-year mandatory convertible securities, expected late yesterday was boosted from a planned $875 million and could total as much as $1.15 billion (proceeds) if investors exercise their overallotment option. 
The securities were expected to have a dividend of between 6.75% and 7% and a conversion premium of 20% to 22%. Earlier indications were a dividend of 7% to 7.5% and a conversion premium of 18% to 22%. The deal was to come through Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney. 
Separately, LSI Logic Corp. repriced an offering of $450 million of five-year convertible subordinated notes, lowering the price to 99 from par, people familiar with the Rule 144a private placement said. 
The notes have a 4% coupon and a 41% conversion premium and now offer a yield-to-maturity of 4.22%. They were quoted lower at 98 1/2 early yesterday, a sign that the deal wasn't well-received after being brought overnight by Lehman Brothers.

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about. 
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critics would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't figure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company. The company's ""lack of disclosure and transparency,"" he says, is ""a longstanding Enron hallmark."" 
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its ""U.S. Select List,"" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's larger but prestigious ""Recommended List"" of 200 or so favored stocks, where it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993. 
""Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze it' or `I can't figure it out,' "" says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclosed number of Enron shares. ""If that were the case, there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn't follow."" 
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week. 
""Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box,"" says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall -- throughout this year. ""It was really a trust-me story, when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust."" 
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had. 
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practices are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable? 
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company's various partnership transactions. 
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings. 
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darling, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the stock, 10 had a ""strong buy"" or equivalent rating on the stock, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a ""buy,"" though not strongly. 
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a ""sell"" rating on Enron. 
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile examples of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warranted. 
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general collapse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- particularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the companies they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees and other revenue. 
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, for one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Boston, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. 
""Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that hasn't been involved,"" says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer, who still rates the stock a ""strong buy"" with a $40 price target. ""They pay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."" 
He adds, ""We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Are we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to provide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation on the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed."" 
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron, calls his holding ""a meaningful investment"" that is ""not small."" But he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer says his clients ""are happy to know"" he has a stake in Enron, because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is. 
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosures of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, he wrote that he and many other investors historically ""have given Enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings"" and position as an industry leader. 
""There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make their money, but every quarter they do,"" he says. ""It's hard to get inside to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."" 
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains ""confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] and an ultimate recovery in the share price."" 
""I know I'm wrong on the stock,"" Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stock doesn't have much further to fall. 
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. ""Even in relative terms, analysts remain very bullish on this stock,"" says Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock on Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a ""buy"" rating. Enron scores a 1.6. ""This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out,"" Mr. Hill says. 
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped it to ""sell"" from ""buy,"" with a brief stop at ""hold."" While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her recent downgrades come ""too little, too late."" 
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the company's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said ""no,"" she says. 
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC ""inquiry,"" she asked Enron about the previous denial. ""They told me it is an inquiry, not an investigation,"" she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Action by Enron halts stock's fall 
But credit ratings are being reviewed 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The recent freefall of Enron Corp.'s stock price stabilized Thursday, a day after the world's largest energy trader replaced its chief financial officer. 
Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, also made two announcements Thursday night aimed at reassuring the financial community. 
In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOnline on Thursday was above average levels. 
Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokeswoman said. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" Jeff McMahon, who took over Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement. 
Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on Thursday. 
Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: ""Enron continues to be the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our customers continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are strong and performing well."" 
Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as ""just more negative sentiment."" 
At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. 
Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enron, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a possible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative. 
Moody's Investors Service put all of Enron's long-term debt on review for potential downgrade last week. 
Enron, which noted that losing its investment-grade rating would take downgrades of three notches, said Thursday it will do everything in its power to defend its current rating. 
In the SEC inquiry, federal securities regulators are reviewing transactions between Enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, who was removed as Enron's chief financial officer Wednesday. Enron removed Fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility. 
Wall Street is also questioning certain of Enron's financing vehicles and is wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the months ahead. 
S&P said it was concerned that the sizable drop in Enron's market capitalization has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the company's plans to rebuild its balance sheet. 
But it also noted that the ""fundamental strength"" of Enron's energy marketing and trading business has remained steady. 
Unless Enron's rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners, Fitch said, it could ""impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets,"" which would hurt its ability to conduct business. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, said the actions by S&P and Fitch might make some of Enron's energy customers skittish. 


Corporate US on track for bailout
DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

10/26/2001
The Guardian
Copyright (C) 2001 The Guardian; Source: World Reporter (TM)

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 18bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. 
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three years, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amendment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour corporate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt ""new deal"", prefer to see increased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects. 
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying little or no tax. 
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be made retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded. 
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calculate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone, while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Dollars 671m. 
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's third largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced to sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m. 
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dislike other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capital investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They say these amount to a ""giant corporate giveaway"". 
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would help companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely to start in the new year. 
""Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of working families,"" the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of California, said. 
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Dollars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of states. 
* A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world economy after the terrorist attacks on the US, trade secretary Patricia Hewitt said yesterday, writes Charlotte Denny 
As a new report predicted that global trade growth will collapse this year, Ms Hewitt warned that the world must not retreat into protectionism or isolationism in the wake of the attacks. WTO trade ministers are gathering in Doha, Qatar, in two weeks' time to discuss launching a new round of talks, the first since the collapse of their meeting in Seattle, nearly two years ago.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C
Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy? 
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor. 
From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing way.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff member, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer. 
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is going to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.'' 
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client to restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements.'' 
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which would certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting. 
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence. 
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess at Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. It will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accounting was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explain -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer. 
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

Enron draws down at least 1 bln usd from credit lines to boost mkt confidence

10/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of 1 bln usd as part of moves to restore market confidence in the company. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" said newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon.
""This is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in Enron. Additionally, we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long-term credit rating."" 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Enron drew down about 3 bln usd and will use part of the money to offer to redeem about 1.85 bln usd of outstanding commercial paper, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. The newspaper cited a person familiar with the matter. 
It quoted observers as saying the move may be is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. 
The source also said Enron is talking to its banks about a new, multi-billion-dollar credit line.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse. 
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief James Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company ""will perish"" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have worsened since the terrorist attacks. ""Today, we are literally hemorrhaging money,"" he wrote. 
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL (UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,000 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expected to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings. 
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeling that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulties to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one union have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked. 
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but sometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise. 
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War 
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our annihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy some DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car? 
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that Congress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism efforts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the economy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. ""The economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists,"" says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. ""War bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."" 
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just superfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savings bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by the federal government. 
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bonds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books. 
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the company on what's delicately termed a ""leave of absence."" 
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence. 
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disinclination to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure ""unsettling,"" noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase, Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And there could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions. 
4. Gold Diggers 
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. According to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty precious-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, with net inflows of $101 million. 
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, during the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion. But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long. 
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an embarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same period, they were up 7.13%. 
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Sept. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again. 
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma operating profit. 
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in long-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningless aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn an economic profit. 
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren Jenson added the humble qualifier, ""There are no guarantees."" Amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago. 
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made progress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20% over the past year. 
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget and SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from previous buy ratings. ""We thought there might be upside to our estimates,"" noted Blodget. ""There wasn't.""

Stocks Post Gains After A Rough Morning

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pair of grim economic reports. 
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in third-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversing an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29, to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99. 
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in recent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good news regarding individual companies. 
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raised its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarded the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several other parts of the energy sector along with it. 
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69. 
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 44 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-storage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54. 
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measure also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a $100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrorist attacks on the economy. 
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily on the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American International Group and WorldCom. 
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 percent dip many analysts had forecast. 
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, the second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally associated with recessions. 
Other Indicators 
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the American Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2,000 small stocks rose 8.31, to 435.96. 
* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and volume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion. 
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday. 
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York trading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents. 
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
* Gold for current delivery rose to $277.80 a troy ounce, from $275.90 on Wednesday, on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Commodity Exchange.

Sudhakar will head Enron probe panel

MUMBAI: Retired supreme court judge Sudhakar Kurdukar will head the judicial panel set up by the Maharashtra government to investigate into the controversial Enron deal. 
An announcement in this regard was made by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh at a press conference held at Mantralaya on Wednesday.
The ruling Democratic Front (DF) coalition had differences over the appointment of the judge, with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) demanding that a retired judge of the Bombay high court head the judicial panel. The Congress and the Left Front partners in the DF, however, insisted on a supreme court judge. 
The issue was hotly debated in the coordination committee of the DF. The NCP members in the DF finally left the decision to Mr Deshmukh.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 billion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the moves were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down six cents at $16.35.

Enron chief executive resigns from board of i2 Technologies

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

DALLAS (AP) - Kenneth Lay, the chairman and chief executive of embattled Enron Corp., has resigned from the board of software company i2 Technologies. 
""This is a very painful decision,"" Lay said in a statement issued Thursday by Dallas-based i2 Technologies. ""But now that I am again taking on the CEO responsibilities at Enron, I must reduce my outside activities.""
Lay resumed the chief executive's job at Enron in August after Jeff Skilling surprised investors by leaving the Houston-based energy company. 
Enron officials did not immediately return calls from The Associated Press. 
In the past week, Enron has been rocked by questions surrounding partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by the company's chief financial officer. The official was replaced on Tuesday. 
Enron's stock price has fallen nearly 50 percent since interest in the partnerships intensified, and the company acknowledged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the arrangements 
I2 makes software to help companies manage their supply chains, and its clients include Texas Instruments, Ford Motor Co. and Dell Computer Corp. 
I2 stock plunged nearly 25 percent on Oct. 17 after the company reported a $5.53 billion third-quarter loss and said it would cut 1,000 jobs, about one-fifth of the work force. 
Lay joined the board in October 2000. No replacement was announced. 
In trading Thursday, i2 shares rose 24 cents to $4.95, and Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35.

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its problems are isolated
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector. 
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, executives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and free-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector. They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
""The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday, a week ago or a month ago,"" said Jim Donnell, president of Duke Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and trades power. 
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy Inc., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday, when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals. 
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 percent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon. 
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earnings, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse. 
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnerships managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence. 
""They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn't come through with flying colors,"" said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York. 
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits. 
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices. 
""Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear,"" Ellinghaus said. 
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment. 
""The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is overdone,"" Barone said. 
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income of $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million in profits. 
""It's business as usual,"" said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. 
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earned $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sept. 30. 
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesday because of ""dire"" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy. 
""All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality,"" Ellinghaus said. 
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday. 
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying close attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid. 
""They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit,"" he said. ""They've never missed a deadline.""

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)
2001-10-25 19:38 (New York)

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

Enron Broadband Begins Closing London, Singapore Offices
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will close down its trading offices in London and Singapore over the next six months. 
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asian and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headquarters.
""It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out there in the market now,"" Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie James said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires. 
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Singapore office has 15 or fewer employees. 
Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizens. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employees. 
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices. 
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that international bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market. 
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to bandwidth trading, making the markets in those regions ripe for growth.

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to trading partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conference call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California about renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the company signed with the state earlier this year. 
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's consistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conference call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, like Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure to Enron. 
""We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net exposure to Enron,"" said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management, Paul Pasoli. ""We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit threshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."" 
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be halted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a little money. 
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the state of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now than when California bought this past winter and spring. 
""Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif contracts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties to do so as well,"" said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. ""If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."" 
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its program to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is about three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capacity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the difference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said that difference, or ""spark spread,"" has grown the past few months. Furthermore, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all projects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment. 
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually through 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and won't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corporation

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, against defendants Enron Corporation (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). 
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.

TGS Q3 net profit up 22 pct yr-on-yr on higher NGL sales, transport revenues

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Perez Companc SA and Enron Corp pipeline joint venture, Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA, said its net profit in the three months to September rose 22 pct year-on-year to 37 mln pesos on the back of strong growth in sales of natural gas liquids (NGL) and increased revenue from transport. 
Total revenue grew 24 pct year-on-year to 147 mln pesos, as ""TGS continues to grow its revenues in all of its business segments,"" CEO Eduardo Ojea Quintana said.
NGL sales surged 86 pct year-on-year to 31.1 mln pesos, after a partial takeover of the Cerri complex's production at Bahia Blanca, although volumes declined as a result of the start-up of the Mega project at the beginning of 2001, Ojea Quintana said. 
Gas transport revenue rose 11 pct year-on-year to 109.6 mln pesos as average gas transportation contracted capacity rose 6 pct to 62.5 mln cubic metres daily, following a capacity expansion completed in June. 
However, he also noted ""important challenges, mostly associated with the relevant regulatory issues that remain unresolved, as well as the deep economic crisis that Argentina is currently undergoing."" 
""These negative factors have adversely affected our investment plans for the current year and for 2002,"" Ojea Quintana added.

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion. 
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has ""more than adequate"" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain its long-term credit rating. 
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook for Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair plans to rebuild the balance sheet. 
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative news from the company. 
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Average daily volume is 7,832,606 shares. 
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediately. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe Enron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock. 
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks, much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of the $1.01 billion charges. 
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said. 
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this week. 
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have concerns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in policy concerning the company. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they haven't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets. 
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

These are the three that came to mind.  I had trouble with my email from home.  Let me know what else I need to do.

Thanks

DG

I managed all back office issues of an asset management deal with Brooklyn Union Gas Company.  It was a two year deal in which Enron was assigned all of the utilities' assets (supply contracts, transportation contracts, and storage contracts) and then became responsible for providing 100% of the gas requirements of BUG.  I was involved in the negotiations to sign the deal, mostly working with the supply group of BUG doing due diligence on their contracts.  I created a complex invoice model and worked with our trading group, our logistics group, our risk management group, and gas accounting group.  In addition, I made monthly trips to New York to manage the customer and take care of any issues.  It was a $24MM/Year deal.  I was the point person on this deal and worked on it for a year and a half before handing it off to someone else when I moved to risk.

I was involved in another asset management deal with Peoples Gas Company in Chicago.  I also did due diligence work and was involved in negotiations on the deal.  I also created invoice models.  I did not do the day to day work because I was on my way to risk management.  We started a joint venture with Peoples in Chicago.  I set up the risk management department and managed all mid and back office issues of the joint venture.  I managed two book administrators who worked in the Chicago office and made monthly visits to address any issues.  This office made $12MM in its first year and we had no issues from a risk management or accounting perspective.

I took over managing the West desk in risk when there was a $10MM flash to actual variance in the region.  Flash to actual is the difference between the reported P&L and the GL.  Within 3 months I had identified the variances and cleared them.  On a going forward basis I kept the variance at zero.  I identified problems in scheduling that were causing these variances and took proactive steps to fix the problem.  After managing the desk for 6 months, I was able to have everyone cross trained on other books.  This resulted in me being able to reduce the staff by one, saving the company approx $100K/Year.

"RE: Pictures of Grace","Yes, by Skilling mostly.  I can't believe that a handful of people brought the company all the way down to the point of bankruptcy.  Basically, they took all the money that the core businesses made and pissed it all away in poor investments (broadband, India, Azurix, etc...)  I just hope I have a job thru the holidays.  I feel vulnerable because I'm the new one in this group.  I would feel more secure if I was still in risk.  Oh well, I guess it's wait and see.

"Wendy McElroy - War Comes With Unintended Consequences","More than 6,000 (more than 4,000 American citizens) innocent civilians have been killed in a brutal attack on our country and our way of life.  If that is not worth fighting for, then what in your opinion is?  I will admit, I am a conservative and therefore our opinions will usually be polarized on many issues.  I am glad that life in our country allows for dissent.  But I think that this right is worth the ulimate sacrifice.  I honestly believe that if we do not respond, and with calculated deadly force, that we ultimately lose.  And I am not talking about losing a war, but our freedom.  I agree with you that war will bring unintended consequenses, but these consequences in my opinion, are the price we must pay to defend our way of life.

 << File: ENA Participation.xls >> 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

Subject:	BUDDY REQUEST - Monte Jones

Orientation Date:  July 2, 2001

Candidate(s):		Monte Jones


In order for this orientation to be a success we will need your support with several items:

Clear the candidate's work schedule to accommodate this orientation plan. - Orientation is now 8 AM to 12 PM

NEW INFORMATION:

There has been a change in the orientation program for new employees.  From now on it will only last a half day and they will no longer get a lunch.  This makes it more important than ever to ensure that each new employee has a buddy assigned and ready to go.

It will be the buddy's responsibility to pick the new employee up after orientation, get them some lunch and deliver them to their work station on Monday afternoon.

Whenever an employee is hired, a buddy is selected.  Once we are notified of who the buddy is, we send them an e-mail describing what they need to do.

Provide a ""Buddy"" to employee.  The Buddy will need to pick the employee up on Monday (EB5C2) at 11:55 PM.
	

*** A BUDDY MUST BE PROVIDED***

Please forward Buddy name and extension to me by Thursday at noon.

Thanks,
Candace

Subject: The CODE



The CODE (rules for men): 

1. Thou shall not rent 'Chocolat'. 

2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella. 

3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers. 

4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, father,
priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should
not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. You are

permitted to deny his very existence. 
 
5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours. 

6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without
recrimination; beyond that, anyone within 
earshot is allowed to call bullshit. (Exception:  When trying to pick up a
girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent) 

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits
forever. 

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running
late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every
point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale. 

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's refrigerator is
forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable. 

10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. (In
fact, even remembering a friend's birthday is strictly optional.) 

11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying
to hook up with is your legal duty.  Should you get carried away with your
good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to
speak of it, even at your bachelor party. 

12. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission; and
he, in return, is required to grant it. 

13. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies
until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a
buffalo wing clean. 

14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem  - you didn't see nothin'.


15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer. 

16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat.  

17. You girlfriend must bond with your buddy's girlfriends within 30 minutes
of meeting them. You are not required to make nice with her gal pals'
significant dick-heads --- low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.


18. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing. 

19. When your girlfriend / wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney friend
with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn
your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood. 

20. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatuate in front of a woman only after you've
brought her to climax. But, if you trap her head under the covers for the
purpose of flatuent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend. 

21. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're
sunning on a tropical beach...And it's delivered by a topless
supermodel...and it's free. 

22. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked. 
 
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain
sober enough to fight. 
 
24. If a buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to fight, you must
jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have
caused you to think, ""What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin,"" you may
sit back and enjoy. 

25. Friends don't let friends wear Speedo's. Ever.  Issue closed. 

26. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting:
""Yeah, baby, push it!"" ""C'mon, give me one more! Harder!""  ""Another set and
we can hit the showers."" ""Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?"" 

27. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,
but not both.  That's just plain mean. 

28. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his
beer. 

29. Never join your girlfriend / wife in dissings a buddy, except when she's
withholding sex pending your response. 

30. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: Both
urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the
conversation you need. 
 
31. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not
join him  ...too gay. 

32. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt
one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, and
deliver a ""F@CK OFF!"" You are absolved of your of responsibility. 

33. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a friend"" have
carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is
no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big
mistake it was. 

34. In Black Jack, always split aces and eight's.  No arguments.

A woman goes into Walmart to buy a rod and reel for
her Husband's birthday. She doesn't know which one to
get so she just grabs one and goes over to the counter.

A Walmart ""associate"" is standing there with dark
shades on. She says, ""Excuse me sir ... can you tell me anything about this
rod and reel?""
He says, ""Ma'am I'm completely blind, but if you'll
drop it on the counter I can tell you everything you need to know about it
from the sound it makes.""
She doesn't believe him, but drops it on the counter
anyway. He says, ""That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with Zebco 404
reel and 10-poundtest line.
It's a good all around combination and it's on sale
this week for only $20.00.""
She says, ""It's amazing that you can tell all that
just by the sound of it dropping on the counter; I'll
take it.""
The woman opens her purse and sees her credit card
holder drop on the floor. As she bends down to pick it up and passes gas.
At first she is really embarrassed, but then concludes
there is no way he could tell it was she that farted.
Being blind, he wouldn't know that she
was the only person around.
The man rings up the sale and says, ""That'll be $34.50
please."" The woman is totally confused by this and says,
""Didn't you tell me it was on special for $20.00? How
did you get $34.50?""
He replies, ""Yes Ma'am, the rod and reel is $20.00;
but the duck call is $11.00 and the catfish bait is $3.50.

I am preparing the Termination for the Twister deal below.  Can you kill or zero out (whichever is applicable to the particular deal) the effected deals in TAGG, and also put a comment on the annuity leg to reflect which deals that payment references?  

VL2515.1 should be killed
Y05186.2 should be killed

VN4969.1 partially terminated (Oct 01- Nov 01 only)
VU4647.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)
Y05186.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)

And the annuity leg Y05186.7 should have a comment reflecting that this payment is for the termination of these deals.  

Thanks,
Diane

We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

This is the last file I sent Dierdre.  It has four tabs.  One summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns (Peoples Deal and PERC Deal).  The monthly values are PV'd.  The PERC tab is the Lagrasta deals.  The Peoples Deal is broken into two tabs (Baseload Sale and Transport).  The baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index -$.03 deal.  Transport is just that.  I hope this helps.

All,

The last information I had on Benefits was that Enron benefits would cease on Feb. 8 and UBS benefits would start on Feb. 16.

Obviously, there is a gap here, and UBS/Enron are working to put something in place to cover this period.

If you have anything elective, you might find that it would be simpler if you were to avoid this gap period.

      around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
      Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese
   place
      in 2
      Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

"RE: Trip","No.  We are going up without tickets.  People who have been say there are usually plenty available.  Don't worry about the $.  I don't like ND, but from experience, it is better whent the home team wins.  The LSU-AU game a couple of years ago just wasn't as exciting as AU-Florida or Wisconsin-Minnesota.

I'm certainly OK with the arrangement long term if you're happy with your
seats.  I would have liked to get you down lower, but that won't be
possible today without a much larger contribution.

And I'm OK with you helping with the foundation contribution - you just
won't get any recognition from Texas or from the IRS with that arrangement.
And with the job market these days, there might come a time when I can't
continue my own level of giving and then everyone will have to make a
decision.   I'd lower my giving so that the total contribution was level
year after year.  If and when you decided to stop, I'd have to start making
up the difference again to keep my seats on row 3.  Or I'd be bumped
somewhere.

I got this many because people started asking about getting tickets - this
is probably how a lot of people do it.  I'm not sure today if I could add
any more to the general area where everyone is.  Sheila and Mark are still
getting tix.

I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide
not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So
just disregard that suggestion.

I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this
current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the
current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.
It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than
get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony
up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.  I'm just not sure what your plans
would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them
back for yourself.  How did you end up with so many?  Is Mark still getting
the two next to mine?  Just curious.  Don't worry about the OU tix,  I will
find you on Saturday.  Thanks as always.

   I got my files restored and indeed had you down for four OU tix.  So
   sorry.
   Let's try to hook up Saturday.

   I wouldn't mind help with the Foundation contribution, but the downside
   all
   belongs to you.  I could practically guarantee that if you were to split
   away and create your own foundation giving you'd get knocked out of your
   seats unless you jumped in at the $2500 level/yr or higher.  Any money
   given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you.  And if you
   decide in the future to start anyway, you lose all the prior years
   cumulative giving where you didn't start.  Any any money you gave me
   wouldn't mean we'd be guaranteed better OU tix (or season tix) because I
   would lower my personal contribution by the same amount.  I don't want
   to
   be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the
   future
   to stop helping.  That said, that may not be important for you and you
   won't mind sending me dollars.

   I know I wouldn't be getting OU tix at all if it wasn't for my
   contribution
   to the Foundation.  Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any
   more,
   so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at
   all.

   Your choice!

   I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are
   Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

   I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I
   guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know
   the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4
   season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for
   6
   years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this
   arrangement.
   I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the
   Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

      Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my

   restoration
      back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them
   with
      seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

      I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you
      paid
      me?

      When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season
   and
      OU
      or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats
   than
      your
      season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix
      with
      their season tix.

      I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

"RE: What's up?","Mike,
In my opinion Onkyo is just a better quality product than Kenwood, thus the price discrepancy.  I (and this is just me) would not buy a Kenwood.  I would buy Onkyo, Denon, Yamaha, or Harman Kardon.  These are more expensive, but I think better than Sony, Kenwood, JVC, Technics, and Pioneer.  The Onkyo 696 is a great receiver.  And I know you can beat the Crutchfield price.  The sites I would check out are onecall.com, soundcity.com, jandr.com, hifi.com.  You also need to look at audioreview.com.  You can see other peoples opinions of products they have actually purchased.  It is a great site.  They will also indicate where they purchased the equipment and how much they paid.  On those sites to buy that I mentioned, you need to call and talk to someone.  They will give you a better price than advertised on the internet.  Give me a call @ 713-853-9573.  I leave for Chicago later this afternoon.

Darron,

What's going on?  How are Kristi and the kids?  How is that Mustang running?
Hey, I finally got the Tahoe.  Still trying to sell the TA..interested?
Just kidding.  Hey, I am starting to look at receivers and had a question or
two (I got the latest Crutchfield Magazine - what website did Scott use to
order his stuff??)

How important is THX Select/Ultra?

Onkyo has a couple of receivers (TX-DS595 and TX-DS696 for $500 and $800)
that have Dolby Digital, DTS, and Dolby Pro Logic II, and 0.08% THD at
75watts X  5 and 0.08% THD at 100 watts X 5 (both 20 - 20 khz), but are not
THX Select.

If you want THX Select on an Onkyo, you are looking at prices of $1000 and
up.

Kenwood has a new one (VR-510) that has THX Select, Dolby Digital, DTS and
Pro Logic II, but it has 0.7% THD at 110watts X 5 (20-20khz).  Crutchfield
has it at $600.  Is the 0.7% THD too high?  I read an article that said you
should try to keep it below 0.1%.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Is the closest hotel to the Enron office the Doubletree?  Do you have an

I was thinking that perhaps we should plan to have dinner on Monday evening.
This would be a good opportunity to get acquainted.  Are you available?
Please let me know as we have not made our airline reservations.

I think we will take the 5:30 flight back to Minneapolis.  I assume that we
should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we

Please confirm the following:

2. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PRICE (CP ID 11360)
3. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PR-OPT (CP ID 92649)
4. Commodity code: NG or NGGJ?
5. Please provide the cutoff date to determine active deals (e.g. instr_end_dt > ? 1-jan-2002?)
6. Use ENA CP ID 1305 as the other side counterparty?

If I can have all the answers soon then I think the deals move can be completed around 3:00p.m.

Importance:	High

Attention: All Enron Employees

HireSynergy wants to express its condolences for everyone at Enron. We have
met and developed relationships with many of you over the years, and have
heard the disappointing news with both the job losses and the invasion of
privacy by the news and media. Since Tuesday 12/4 seems to be the last known
day of employment for most of you, we are offering everyone at Enron the
following immediate services at no charge, so please forward this email to
all of your friends and colleagues:

How HireSynergy can help you NOW:

1) Resume writing tips that help you get the interview
2) Interview techniques to help you get the job offer, even if your
technical skills aren't an exact match
3) Identify specific job opportunities that match your background and
criteria (as opposed to you applying via the internet or Human Resources job
postings, and not hearing back for weeks or being completely overlooked.).

HireSynergy is a retainer and contingency search firm that traditionally
charges fees to clients for our services.  However, since most of Enron's
major competitors already have access to you, our contribution to the Enron
community is proactively helping everyone through the job search process,
regardless of what stage of the interview process you're in.

HireSynergy specializes in the areas of Accounting, Tax, Finance and Risk
Management.
In addition, we have a division that places Executive Secretaries and all
clerical/ administrative staff.

We are walking distance from Enron! Please give us a call at 713-222-7667.

Hi Darron,
Hope all is well with you and your family.  Boy, do I have an offer for
you!!!

Sprint is looking for consumers in Houston to test our new ION
technology.  ION stands for Intergrated On-Demand Network.  It basically
provides your voice service and your data service over the same phone
line.  ION offers several different products.  There is a 1 phone line
version, 2 phone lines and up to 4 phone lines.  We also offer just a
data/internet access only product.  The real benefit with ION is that
when you have one phone line, you can be on the internet and talking on
the phone at the same time.

Anyway, if you are interested in helping us test ION in Houston, please
let me know.  I will need your phone number and address to see if you
are in our coverage area.  Of course, the service would be free of
charge during the testing period.  If you want more information
regarding ION, you can visit our website at www.ion.sprint.com.

We need to start making plans for the KU-Texas football game!

Tell everyone hello for me!

Be sure to visit this  sight.  It is very well done.  Some of you know
Jamie Wax  and  others will have heard the name Taranto because Darlene,
who taught Hank and  Mamie and will, hopefully, teach Mak in 5th grade is
Paul's wife.  Paul and  Jamie wrote the musical ""Evangeline"" (based on the
Acadian story of Evangeline).   The music is from that play.

I have seen several tributes -- but this one is really special.  New photos
of the WTC
disaster - such an unbelievable nightmare.  Take a few minutes to watch
this.  It's worth it.
-- Jarja

A  guy in Baton Rouge -- Mason Wood -- put together this incredible
montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical ""Evangeline"".
They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
up!  Then send this on.  I did.

"RE: Season tix are in","I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So just disregard that suggestion. 

I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.  It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.  I'm just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself.  How did you end up with so many?  Is Mark still getting the two next to mine?  Just curious.  Don't worry about the OU tix,  I will find you on Saturday.  Thanks as always.

I got my files restored and indeed had you down for four OU tix.  So sorry.
Let's try to hook up Saturday.

I wouldn't mind help with the Foundation contribution, but the downside all
belongs to you.  I could practically guarantee that if you were to split
away and create your own foundation giving you'd get knocked out of your
seats unless you jumped in at the $2500 level/yr or higher.  Any money
given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you.  And if you
decide in the future to start anyway, you lose all the prior years
cumulative giving where you didn't start.  Any any money you gave me
wouldn't mean we'd be guaranteed better OU tix (or season tix) because I
would lower my personal contribution by the same amount.  I don't want to
be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the future
to stop helping.  That said, that may not be important for you and you
won't mind sending me dollars.

I know I wouldn't be getting OU tix at all if it wasn't for my contribution
to the Foundation.  Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any more,
so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at all.

Your choice!

I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are
Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I
guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know
the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4
season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6
years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.
I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the
Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

   Subject:  RE: Season tix are in


   Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my
   records
   of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
   back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
   seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

   I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you
   paid
   me?

   When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and
   OU
   or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than
   your
   season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix
   with
   their season tix.

   I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

   We'll get it worked out

   I just got the tickets.  Thanks for sending them.  I paid for 4 OU
   tickets,
   could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you about
   the
   possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.  I know you
   get quite a few each year, but don't know if you have extras available.
   Thanks again.

      OU tix are in!

      We'll work out leaving the tix for you under the mat, unless you'd
   like
      me
      to fedex them to you.  Let me know

      It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll
   probably
      just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day
   of
      the
      NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this
   with
      you
      next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word
   on
      OU?

      Thanks

         I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the
         tickets.
         If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later

You have two cows.  You sell three of them to your publically listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank.  

Then, you execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general officer, so you get all four cows back, with a tax-exemption for the fifth cow, of course.

The rights to the estimated future value of the milk cash flow stream of the six cows are monetized and transferred via an intermediary to the Caymen Islands, secretly owned by a majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company, off-balance sheet, of course. 

The annual report says the company owns eight cows and recognizes milk revenue for the 20 year life of the cows.

This is hedged with derivative cow life insurance policy through a Caymen Island bank, and these hedges are arranged through EnronOnline's commodity storefront with an option to buy one more cow, no balance sheet provided.....

The company says it will file all footnotes at a later date.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon works
best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place in 2
Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

DG

I hope you had a good Holiday Season.  Hopefully 2002 will be better than 2001!  I believe that this year the limit has been raised on the Education IRA's.  Is this true?  If so, I would like to contribute more than the $500 that it has been.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

"FW: Cross Timbers 1/01","Anne,
It looks like Crosstimbers had a phys trade with us at NWPL Rox + $.025 and they also had fin trades (Nymex and Basis).  We combined them to essentially make Jan01 a fixed price deal.  It appears the customer is questioning this.  Why they are 8 months after settlement date, I have no idea.  I already spoke with Carole about this and she has the deal tickets but if you have any questions, just ask.

Megan,
Anne should be able to explain this to you.  She runs the West desk now.

Darron:
I saw your name in the audit as changing a price on Cross Timbers deal 434968 for Jan 01.  The note in the terms tab says that the deal was triggered at 8.65, so you changed it from NWPL.Rockies + 0.025 to a fixed 8.65.  I spoke to Cross Timbers and they said they did not trigger this deal.  They said the price should remain at index + 0.025.  Can you confirm this price for me?  I'm showing a $40k adjustment that Cross Timbers does not.

Thanks,
Megan

Subject:	Fw: The cost of kids...


The Cost of  Children 
I have seen repeatedly the breakdown of the cost of 
raising  a child, but this is the first time I have seen the 
rewards listed this way.  It's nice, really nice! 
The government recently calculated the cost  
of raising a child from birth to 18 and came up with 
$160,140! That  doesn't even touch college tuition. 
For those with kids, that figure  leads to wild fantasies about 
all the money we could have banked if not for  (insert your child's name 
here). 
For others, that number might confirm  the decision to remain childless. 
But $160,140 isn't so bad if you break  it down. It translates 
into $8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month, or $171.08 a  week. 
That's a 
 mere $24.44 a day! Just over a dollar an hour.  
 Still, you might think the best financial advice says don't  
 have children if you want to be ""rich"". It is just the opposite.  
 What do you get for your $160,140? 
Naming rights.  First, middle, and last! 
 Glimpses of God every day.  
 Giggles under the covers every night. 
 More love than  your heart can hold. 
  Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.  
 Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds, and warm cookies.  
 A hand to hold, usually covered with jam. 
 A partner  for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building 
 sandcastles, and skipping  down the sidewalk in the pouring rain. 
 Someone to laugh yourself  silly with no matter what 
 the boss said or how your stocks performed  that day. 
 For $160,140, you never have to grow up.  
 You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek,  
 catch lightning bugs, and never stop believing in Santa Claus.  
 You have an excuse to keep: reading The Adventures of Piglet  
 and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney  
 movies, and wishing on stars. 
 You get to frame rainbows,  hearts, and flowers under 
 refrigerator magnets and collect spray  painted noodle 
 wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay for  
 Mother's Day, and cards with backward letters for 
 Father's  Day. 
 For $160,140, there is no greater bang for your buck.  
 You get to be a hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the  
 garage roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, removing a  
 splinter, filling the wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of  
 bangs, and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always  
 gets treated to ice cream regardless. 
 You get a front  row seat to history; to witness the first step, 
 first word, first bra,  first date, and first time behind the wheel. 
 You get to be  immortal. 
 You get another branch added to your family tree, and  
 if you're lucky, a long list of limbs in your obituary called  
 grandchildren. 
 You get an education in psychology,  nursing, criminal 
 justice, communications, and human sexuality that no  
 college can match. 
 In the eyes of a child, you rank  right up there with God. 
 You have all the power to heal a boo-boo,  scare away 
 the monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart,  
 police a slumber party, ground them forever, and love 
 them  without limits, so one day they will, like you, 
 love without counting  the cost. 
 ENJOY YOUR KIDS (and grandkids) !!!!!!

Dear Billy, 
Nice spelling. You're on  your way to a great career in lawn care. 
How about I  send you a frickin book so you can learn to read and 
write? 
I'm giving your older brother the space  ranger. At least HE can

Dear Santa, 
I have been a good girl all  year, and the only thing I ask for is 
peace and joy in  the world for everybody!

Dear Santa, 
I don't know if you can do  this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and daddy  to get back together. Please see what you 
can do?  
Love Teddy 
Dear Teddy, 
Look, your dad's banging the  babysitter like a screen door in a 
hurricane. Do you  think he's gonna give that up to come back to 
your  frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give 
up that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead.

Dear Santa, 
What do you do the other 364  days of the year? Are you busy 
making toys?  
Your friend,

Dear Thomas, 
All the toys are made in  China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I 
spend most of my  time making low-budget porno films.  These 
producers seem to like fat studs. I unwind by drinking myself  
silly and squeezing the asses of all the cocktail  waitresses 
while losing money at the craps table.  
Hey, you wanted to know.

Dear Santa, 
Do you see us when we're  sleeping, do you really know when

Dearest Santa,

Mark, 
First, stop calling yourself  ""Marky"", it sounds gay. That's why 
you're getting your  ass whipped at school.  Second, you don't

Third,  I get inside your pad just like your mother's boyfriend 
does, thru the bedroom window. 
Sweet  Dreams,

Periodically, I need some help in data gathering for analysis.  Is it
possible for someone at Enron to occasionally provide the gas market data
that I need?

I would like to look at the following data for 1999 and 2000 prior to our
November 13 meeting.

*	Daily Henry Hub Prices
*	Daily Ventura Prices
*	Monthly Index Henry Hub (Inside FERC Gas Market Report)

I got your message, but I must have missed you.  Try calling Debbie Delgado @ x39183.  She is the ADMIN who sits next to me.

If you want to just call Kai directly about mortgages, his vital signs are below (just kidding).  The best place to reach him is at 713-816-1300.

Kai Bike

See you soon.

How are things in your world ?

Pretty strange to be starting in a new group at such an uncertain time.

I like my group.

Thanks

Subject:	more terminated deals to move

Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and I have been working from a report provided by Russell Diamond that lists ""live"" deals for counterparties and our current exposure.  Based on that list, here are some deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books.  There will be many more deals listed to move on Tuesday.  Please note that deals for many of the counterparties listed on Russell's report have already been moved into the bankruptcy books due to auto-termination.

Once we finish looking at the ""live"" counterparties, we will continue providing deal information for new contracts that are added to the Master Log report compiled by Legal.  I will be adding the deals from Cyndie's sheets on Tuesday.  I have 8 more counterparties to review from Russell's report and that information will be provided on Tuesday as well.

Please call if you have any questions.  

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Lucy wanted me to let you know that I will be handling Utilicorp from the gas end.  It is a territorial issue.  I gave John a quote on the Cal 02 strip and am following up with credit because we don't have an ISDA in place with them.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance on your end.  Thanks.
