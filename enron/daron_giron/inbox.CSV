"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.

The file was too big to email.  It contains all financial deals (P,B,I,GD) in the active NG-PRICE book.  It does not contain any option deals.  I will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  It is saved in O:/_Dropbox.

: Thermics of Hell

The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington
chemistry mid term.  The answer by one student was so profound that the
professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course,
why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.

Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs
heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas
cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some
variant.  One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need
to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are
leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it
will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are
entering Hell, lets look at the different
religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that
if you are not a member of their religion,
you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and
since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that
all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in
Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the
volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature
and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand
proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:
1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter
Hell, then the temperature and pressure   in Hell will increase until all
Hell breaks loose.

2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell,
then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So
which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year,
....that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you, and take
into
account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations
with her, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is
exothermic and will not freeze.

The student received the only A given

Attached is a spreadsheet with the potential write offs in 12/01 general ledger.  In addition, I think Phyllis talked to you about other changed - i.e. we will not be booking UA4 or FTA in 12/01 general ledger.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I am not sure of the process on our end, I have submitted this information to Greg Whiting who is going to submit it to his boss, etc.  I will let you know when I hear something back from them and please let me know if there is a problem on your end.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"FW: Blood Drive Update","Group:

I know you are all being forwarded the messages on the blood drive and the contribution matching by Enron (2 for 1) to charitable organizations in NY.  I know we ask a lot of our employees and sometimes all these ""contributions"" seem overwhelming.  I personally ask each of you to take time this week in your own personal way to give thanks.  We have group members who were close to harms way and the Central Region has family members potentially lost in this tragedy.  

The best way I know to encourage an official ""time-out""  is to ensure you all start your weekends with your families starting at noon today.  Officially Central Origination/enovate are closed this afternoon.

Sincerely,

Laura

Wow!  Enron employees and other Houstonians are showing such generosity!  

The response to the blood drive has been outstanding.  Employees from Continental Airlines and other surrounding corporations have come to our blood donation site to give.  Blood Center personnel have informed us that because of the overwhelming response donations are now being taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Blood Center is attempting to keep appointments on schedule.  However, we ask for your patience and understanding if there is a delay. 

It is indeed gratifying to witness your continued generosity to the community and beyond.

The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls

Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.


Thanks

"RE: new script for moving books","
Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Subject: The CODE



The CODE (rules for men): 

1. Thou shall not rent 'Chocolat'. 

2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella. 

3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers. 

4. When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, father,
priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should
not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts. You are

permitted to deny his very existence. 
 
5. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a
friend out of jail within 12 hours. 

6. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without
recrimination; beyond that, anyone within 
earshot is allowed to call bullshit. (Exception:  When trying to pick up a
girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent) 

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits
forever. 

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running
late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every
point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale. 

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's refrigerator is
forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable. 

10. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. (In
fact, even remembering a friend's birthday is strictly optional.) 

11. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying
to hook up with is your legal duty.  Should you get carried away with your
good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to
speak of it, even at your bachelor party. 

12. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission; and
he, in return, is required to grant it. 

13. Women who claim they ""love to watch sports"" must be treated as spies
until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a
buffalo wing clean. 

14. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem  - you didn't see nothin'.


15. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer. 

16. A man must never own a cat or like his girlfriend's cat.  

17. You girlfriend must bond with your buddy's girlfriends within 30 minutes
of meeting them. You are not required to make nice with her gal pals'
significant dick-heads --- low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.


18. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing. 

19. When your girlfriend / wife expresses a desire to fix her whiney friend
with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn
your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood. 

20. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatuate in front of a woman only after you've
brought her to climax. But, if you trap her head under the covers for the
purpose of flatuent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend. 

21. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're
sunning on a tropical beach...And it's delivered by a topless
supermodel...and it's free. 

22. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked. 
 
23. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain
sober enough to fight. 
 
24. If a buddy is outnumbered, outmanned, or too drunk to fight, you must
jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have
caused you to think, ""What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin,"" you may
sit back and enjoy. 

25. Friends don't let friends wear Speedo's. Ever.  Issue closed. 

26. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting:
""Yeah, baby, push it!"" ""C'mon, give me one more! Harder!""  ""Another set and
we can hit the showers."" ""Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?"" 

27. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,
but not both.  That's just plain mean. 

28. If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his
beer. 

29. Never join your girlfriend / wife in dissings a buddy, except when she's
withholding sex pending your response. 

30. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: Both
urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the
conversation you need. 
 
31. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not
join him  ...too gay. 

32. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt
one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, and
deliver a ""F@CK OFF!"" You are absolved of your of responsibility. 

33. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly ""just a friend"" have
carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is
no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big
mistake it was. 

34. In Black Jack, always split aces and eight's.  No arguments.

games are on Tuesday or Thursday for the remainder of the season.  Based upon
this schedule, I have tried to get Queenston # 4 for us to practice on every
Saturday from 4 to 6 p.m.

Also note that the game for tomorrow night has been changed from Queenston #
7 to Queenston # 7.

There is a new faciltiy  that was not on the original list - West Little York
# 1.  If you do not know where this field is, ask me or check out
www.cy-fairsports.com.  Simplified directions are take 290 east towards the
beltway, exit Gessner/West Little York, turn on West Little york east (goes
over 290).  Stay on West little York past the 1st light and turn into the
ball fields.  The Mustang Field will be straight ahead if you turn into the
facility from West Little York (There are 2 set of fields.  The field we will
play on does not have playground equipment next to the ball fields).

We have set a picture time.  I believe Amy Eagan has scheduled us for 1:30
p.m. on 13-Oct-01.  The pictures will be taken at the Cy-Fair Fields.  I will
bring a digital camera so parents can have a digital picture of their players.

See you tomorrow night at the ball fields.

Legal was unable to produce the document needed for the data moves today.  Looks like they are pushing for Monday; therefore, IT Infrastructure will not be converting the NetCo accounts over the weekend.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"What's up","Did you go to the game this weekend?    UT looked strong after the first
20min.  Hopefully Neb. and Tech can beat OU.  The A&M game looks like it
could be more of a challenge than I had originally thought.    What's going
on at Enron?  I saw where the SEC will be investigating an Enron
partership.  What's your take on the situation there?

Let's go to lunch soon.

I got your message, but I must have missed you.  Try calling Debbie Delgado @ x39183.  She is the ADMIN who sits next to me.

If you want to just call Kai directly about mortgages, his vital signs are below (just kidding).  The best place to reach him is at 713-816-1300.

"FW: Patience...","
Read all the way to the end or you will miss out.

A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of
him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise
jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2"" in diameter. He then
asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was.

So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the
jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open
areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was
full. They agreed it was. The students laughed.

The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course,
the sand filled up everything else. ""Now,"" said the professor, ""I want you
to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things -
your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if
everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be
full.

The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your
car. The sand is everything else. The small stuff.""

""If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or
the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and
energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are
important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your
happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take
your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the
house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal.""

""Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your
priorities. The rest is just sand.""

But then... A particularly adept student took the jar which the other
students and the professor agreed was full, and proceeded to pour in a glass
of beer. Of course the beer filled the remaining spaces within the jar
making the jar truly full.

The student said "" You know, no matter how full your life is of big and
small things, there is always room in it for BEER.""

"RE: Season tix are in","
Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my records
of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you paid
me?

When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and OU
or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than your
season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix with
their season tix.

I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

We'll get it worked out

You know your company has ""made it"" when:
You hear the christian radio station in town asking for prayer
They start relating how many shares it would take to buy a hotdog at the stadium
Your friends won't let you pay for dinner
You can judge how good of a day it will be by the number of news trucks in front of the building
You start eying the parmasan cheese contianer, how long it will sustain you and if the resturaunt would miss it
The waiter immediatly offers you a glass of wine when he finds out who you work(ed) for
You spend more time trying to convince vendors you are still in business (pipelines) than actually doing business
The CNN news truck takes up residence in front of the building
You toy with the idea of grabbing a box and walking out the front door, so you can give the poor news guys something to do
The number of police officers increases in the building
You take the remaining cents/dollar from your 401k and invest in beer stocks
Wondering if anyone would notice you leaving with a comfy mesh chair under your arm
People's party planning skills are greatly enhanced due to the over use during the day
The waiter asks if you would like a refill on water you inquire if it is free 
You look at the change in your pocket and wonder if you should go in for a couple more shares


 
10.  Learn to make your own clothes, cut hair for family and friends, and other old-fashioned ways to reduce costs.

9.  Rent a mini-bus to give tours of River Oaks, pointing out the homes of Fast Andy Fastow, Uncle Ben Glisan, Little Jeffy Skilling, etc. in case anyone wants to return on their own to give personal notes of thanks for freeing up all this time to be with family over the holidays.

8.  Audition for next Survivor show.

7.  Harness your chi.

6.  Start therapy to unlearn key Enron phrases ""world's leading (fill in the blank)"", etc.

5.  Take advantage of the proximity of the world-class Texas Medical Center to participate in some of those extended drug studies - they often provide food and housing during some of the psychotropic trials.

4.  Familiarize yourself with Ebay so that you may unload some of your Enron logo wear, or other small electronic items which may have accidentally ended up at your home when Price Waterhouse seized the building.  (And remember: looting is a crime.)

3.  If necessary, make amends with your parents or in-laws - they're old enough that their houses are probably paid for, and likely won't let your kids starve or become homeless.

2.  Remind yourself that, unless you are a child, no one is ultimately responsible for your health, wealth or happiness except you.

1.  Keep your perspective:  if you have love, religion, health, then you're as rich as you've always been, only slightly less encumbered by material wealth.

"FW: What Enron Did Right","Subject:	What Enron Did Right

A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.

Manager's Journal:
What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the
vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),
competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and
dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being
an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from
grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.

   Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron
became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor
of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles
drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements
were all a mirage.
   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under
investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts
of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the
law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve
themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an
enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.


   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and
electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open
market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to
enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.

   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,
and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have
been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough
deregulation.


   -- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the
old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were
offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system
was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you
can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that
could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.

   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its
constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,
and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's
investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by
inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph
Schumpeter called the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative
destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be
part of Enron's problem today.


   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended
the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper
company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper
plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run
all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.
Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with
inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of
""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisioned creating free markets for
components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market
terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The
development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions
of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the
economy.


   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated
environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a
single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could
be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to
the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of
alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling
switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules
or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,
and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This
policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value
for both customers and suppliers.


   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could
easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of
the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal
controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we
judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of
Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion
each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on
company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.

   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading
losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's
ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and
trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,
counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the
erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.


   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's
corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood
stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,
slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline
company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron
became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It
bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to
start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.

   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and
an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization
and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe
the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.
This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could
serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.

   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the
transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet
corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in
almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.

   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to
find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all
should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to
reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

                      A Must Read From the Miami Herald

                      Read this and try not to tear up...
                      by Leonard Pitts Jr. of the Miami Herald
                      We'll go forward from this moment

                      It's my job to have something to say.
                      They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles the
                      American soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting
                      disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that seem to
                      fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering.

                      You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard.

                      What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward's attack on our World
                      Trade Center, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn?
                      Whatever it was, please know that you failed.

                      Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause.

                      Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve.

                      Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together.

                      Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a family
                      rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family nonetheless. We're
                      frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional energy on pop
                      cultural minutiae -- a singer's revealing dress, a ball team's misfortune, a
                      cartoon mouse. We're wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets
                      and material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a
                      certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though --
                      peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right thing and to
                      do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, believers in
                      a just and loving God.

                      Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak.
                      You're mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot
                      be measured by arsenals.


                      IN PAIN

                      Yes, we're in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We're still
                      grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to make
                      ourselves understand that this isn't a special effect from some Hollywood
                      blockbuster, isn't the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel. Both in terms
                      of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final death toll, your
                      attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the
                      United States and, probably, the history of the world. You've bloodied us as we
                      have never been bloodied before.

                      But there's a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall.
                      This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit
                      us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental
                      pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When
                      provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go
                      to any length, in the pursuit of justice.

                      I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I think,
                      do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread of
                      the future.

                      In the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing
                      to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to
                      prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided
                      talk of revoking basic freedoms. We'll go forward from this moment sobered,
                      chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined.


                      THE STEEL IN US

                      You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our
                      character is seldom understood by people who don't know us well. On this day,
                      the family's bickering is put on hold.

                      As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we
                      will rise in defense of all that we cherish.

                      So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe
                      you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that's the case,
                      consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You don't
                      know my people. You don't know what we're capable of. You don't know what
                      you just started.

                      But you're about to learn.

"FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., Exec. V.P., FINANCE & TREASURER","
To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

Brian,
This is an excerpt from an article (attached) that I used to estimate the energy requirements for the new ethanol plants.  I thought you might be interested.  If you are interested, I can provide you with a complete list of all the plants under construction and a list of planned constructions as well.
Jozef
Natural Gas . We anticipate that our plant will require a natural gas supply of at least 0.75 billion cubic feet per year at a minimum rate of 100 MCF per hour and at a minimum of 200 psig at the plant site. To access sufficient supplies of natural gas to operate the plant, a connection to a distribution pipeline located underground at our site will be required. We have no current agreement with any third party to construct such a connection.

"Enron's Texas Style Trading","

You have two cows.  You sell three of them to your publically listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank.  

Then, you execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general officer, so you get all four cows back, with a tax-exemption for the fifth cow, of course.

The rights to the estimated future value of the milk cash flow stream of the six cows are monetized and transferred via an intermediary to the Caymen Islands, secretly owned by a majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company, off-balance sheet, of course. 

The annual report says the company owns eight cows and recognizes milk revenue for the 20 year life of the cows.

This is hedged with derivative cow life insurance policy through a Caymen Island bank, and these hedges are arranged through EnronOnline's commodity storefront with an option to buy one more cow, no balance sheet provided.....

The company says it will file all footnotes at a later date.

   George W. Bush and Bill Clinton somehow ended up at the same barbershop.
 As they sat there, each being worked on by a different barber, not a word
 was spoken. The barbers were both afraid to start a conversation, for fear
 it would turn  to politics.

    As the barbers finished their shaves, the one who had Clinton in his
 chair reached for the aftershave. Clinton was quick to stop him saying, ""No
 thanks, my wife Hillary will smell that and think I've been in a
 whorehouse.""

 The second barber turned to Bush and said, ""How about you?"" Bush replied,
 ""Go ahead. My wife Laura doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse
 smells like.""

Based on that list, here are some deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books.  There will be many more deals listed to move on Tuesday.  Please note that deals for many of the counterparties listed on Russell's report have already been moved into the bankruptcy books due to auto-termination.

Once we finish looking at the ""live"" counterparties, we will continue providing deal information for new contracts that are added to the Master Log report compiled by Legal.  I will be adding the deals from Cyndie's sheets on Tuesday.  I have 8 more counterparties to review from Russell's report and that information will be provided on Tuesday as well.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

"Important - GDI  'Y' Curve Manager Issue","

Make sure on the TDS Curve Manager not to hit the    button on the publish sheet.  This button normally
brings in the latest version of code, however the latest version does not include information for the 'Y' curve.
This will be fixed after the code freeze that is now in place is released.

Any questions or problems, give me a call.

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Well the move to Netco begins.  I would like to schedule a meeting for Wednesday, January 2nd at 10:00 a.m. to discuss the below and map out our plan of action.  As I am sure you are aware, this is our course to set, so let's think outside the framework on the most effective way to start a new company.
 
I am following e-mail from home.  If you have thoughts/concerns/questions prior to the meeting, let me know.
 
Happy New Year to everyone!

Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning



We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter 

Target Number of Transactions 
+       Phase 1 
+       Phase 2 
+       Phase 3 

IT transfer

"RE: GD Options","I agree.  Everything looks right

we booked basedload summer sell of 95,000.  ENA calls of 50,000 and ENA puts of 30,000 for PGL

we booked summer puts of 5,000 for NS

we booked winter calls of 45,000 for PGL

The GD Options (both calls and puts) are booked year round.  They are all in N17872.9, N17872.A, N17872.B, N18064.6, and N18254.4.  I will begin looking at the unwind problem.

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Please confirm the following:
1. I can't find the book ENA-WT-SOCAL in Estate database (please provide the CP ID)
2. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PRICE (CP ID 11360)
3. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PR-OPT (CP ID 92649)
4. Commodity code: NG or NGGJ?
5. Please provide the cutoff date to determine active deals (e.g. instr_end_dt > ? 1-jan-2002?)
6. Use ENA CP ID 1305 as the other side counterparty?

Also, when physical deals are done, will all risk types go to the same desk or will one person be managing the index separately.  ex. the west desk used to book all index to Grigsby's book.

This is the last file I sent Dierdre.  It has four tabs.  One summarizes the monthly cash flow into two columns (Peoples Deal and PERC Deal).  The monthly values are PV'd.  The PERC tab is the Lagrasta deals.  The Peoples Deal is broken into two tabs (Baseload Sale and Transport).  The baseload sale includes all of the price fixing deals as well as the index -$.03 deal.  Transport is just that.  I hope this helps.

Subject:	New ERMS Application


in preparation for the upcoming Oracle 8i migration a new ERMS application
has been developed. THE OLD RUNM BLUE MENU WILL NO LONGER WORK
when the database is upgraded to 8i.

What is different:

	- Most reports can be viewed on the screen using Adobe Acrobat.
	- Most reports and forms will now run on the PC and not on capers.
	- We have removed a lot of reports and forms that are no longer being used.
	- The screens now comes up faster.
	- A new report called curveviewer has been added to facilitate curve entry checking

What is the same:

	- Your ERMS access
	- ALL top page reports
	- The Gas Daily Curve shift
	- curveview/curveload/batchload program that runs on UNIX.
	- We will still provide you the old PortCalc and report screen
	  that runs on the UNIX in case you do not like the PC version.

Attached is the documentation on how to start the new ERMS-PC application.
You will have to close all of your PC applications and re-boot your PC in order
for the ERMS-PC application to appear on your start menu.

Please inform all ERMS RUNM users.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

I hope everyone has a great holiday coming up. With the
exception of the NCAA Tournament, this is my favorite
time of the year. Bowl season. I will watch them all.
Every single one of them. That New Orleans Bowl, wow.
North Texas, at 5-6, makes a bowl? You must be kidding,
right? Colorado State put the wood to the Mean Green,
and I watched the whole thing. The good news for the
participants in the New Orleans Bowl? You went to a
bowl game. The bad news? Now you have to go back and
take your finals.

The BCS
I'm not sure how in the world Nebraska ended up in the
Rose Bowl. If I am an Oregon fan, I am livid. The Ducks
finished the year 10-1, won the PAC-10 and did everything
that was asked of them, and were left out. Nebraska got 62
pinned on them in late November and still got in. Unacceptable.
The mantra of college football for years has been if you
lose, lose early - unless you're Nebraska. I don't think
Colorado should be there, either (2 losses), but at least
they won the conference.  I figured out a little system
within the BCS that might work, and here it is:

1.  Only conference champions are eligible for the national
title. Nebraska or Florida can still go to a BCS bowl, but
only the champs can win it. This year that would be Miami,
Oregon, Colorado, Illinois and Maryland. You can use the BCS
to determine the top 2. (This would obviously have to be
modified for independent teams like Notre Dame, but that's
for smarter people than me)

2.  If a case like the Oregon/Colorado situation comes up,
where the 2 teams are so close that a clear-cut #2 cannot
be determined, have them play 2 weeks from the BCS announcement
day, which is around the 16th. Pick a place half way between
each school, maybe Vegas for this one, and the BCS can pick
up the bill for both teams, their staffs and bands. The revenue
made from it being the only televised college game that day
would more than make up for the costs. The winner goes to the
title game and the loser goes to a pre-determined bowl.
The 2-week interval would give the kids time to take their
finals, go to award ceremonies (like the Heisman), and still
have a solid week of practice in there for the game. It would
not affect the preparation for the bowl game, since most teams
don't start that until around Christmas. The only down side I
see is it's a long, NFL-like year for the kids. Trust me when
I say it would have bothered no one in Eugene or Boulder if
there was a game last weekend to see who would draw Miami.

The Holiday Bowl in San Diego
Washington
7:30 pm (Austin Time)
ESPN

Texas goes back to Cali to exorcise some west coast demons. The
'horns went 0-2 there in 2000, with a bad effort against Stanford
and a nail biter v. Oregon. Texas is a heavy favorite in this
game for good reason, at least on paper. The Longhorns finished
the season ranked #1 in defense, allowing only 236.3 ypg. The
Huskies are a passing team, and are 16th nationally with 279.5 ypg.
Texas is 12th v. the pass, allowing only 173.7 ypg. They say to
beat a team, make them one-dimensional. Washington already is
one-dimensional. They are 96th nationally in rushing at 111.7 ypg,
which plays right into the hands of the 6th ranked Texas rush
defense, which yields only 89.5 ypg. If Ivan Williams played for
the Huskies, he would be their 2nd leading rusher (trailing the
leader by ~20 yards) and he hasn't seen the field since day light
savings. The Texas defense has to be licking their chops for a
redemption game after the Big XII Championship, and this one could
be just what the doctor ordered, at least on paper.
The match-up of the day will be Quentin Jammer vs. Reggie Williams.
You all know Jam's story, but if you haven't heard of Reggie
Williams, pay attention. The 6'4"" 215 lb. freshman is Udub's
""Real Deal.""   He had 973 yards on 55 catches and was the PAC-10's
Freshman of the Year.  If he gets loose in the secondary, look
out. The other side of field will be just as intriguing,  with
Rod Babers locked up with burner Paul Arnold, who is their main
deep threat. Babers is a great cover corner, but will have to
bring his A-game to keep up with Arnold. The main problem for
Washington this year has been their o-line. They have given up
25 sacks this season, and are only 38% in 3rd down conversions.
If the Texas front 7 can bring heat on qb Cody Pickett, the Husky
offense could be in trouble.  Major Applewhite starts his final
college game. The offense will not change in scheme, since neither
Texas qb likes to run. Look for some shotgun, though, since Major
likes it and Chris doesn't. If Benson goes (check in the news and
notes section for more on Ced), Texas will look to exploit the
weakness of the Huskies- their run defense. Washington gives up
162 ypg on the ground,  which is exactly what Texas averages.
They allow 4.2 per carry and a whopping 20 touchdowns on the
ground. Senior dt Larry Tripplett is in the Casey Hampton mold,
and the All-American is a great run stopper, but the linebacking
corps is hasn't played consistent enough to help on run defense.
The secondary is young and inexperienced. They have had their
moments, but as a whole, good teams can beat them.  If the Texas
o-line can spark up the running game, Applewhite will pick them
apart with his vision. Look for Washington to bring the house at
Major, and if the o-line repels the borders, Husky fans will be
leaving VERY early.

CORRECTION:

I gave you the wrong address for Moose McGillycuddy's.
Apparently there are 2, and I picked the wrong one.
Here it is:
Moose McGillycuddy's
535 5th Avenue

tEXas tailgate
We are meeting for lunch and watching the Aggie game at a sports
bar on the Trolley route to the stadium. This is not a typical
tailgate party. There will not be balloons or ribbons or any
fanfare, nor will there be any band or reserved seating or anything.
This is simply a gathering place to watch the Aggies and Frogs
and eat something before heading over to the game. We will be
there from 12:30 on. If you have a party of 8 or more, call for
reservations.

Trophy's
7510 Hazard Center Drive
San Diego, CA 92108
619/296-9600
Trolley Exit: Hazard Center

Here is a link to maps and more info:
http://sandiego.citysearch.com/profile/86394

Thursday night we will be at Moose McGillycuddy's (info above)

The team will arrive at QualComm at 3:30 on the west side of
the stadium between gates E and F.


Let's get that 11th win! See you all in San Diego.

News and Notes:
* Don't expect Cedric Benson to play. He is having trouble
with his neck after his Big XII Championship stinger. Look
Victor Ike and Ivan Williams to get the call.
Welcome back, I-Train.
* The 2001 Texas Longhorns could be only the 5th Longhorn
team ever to win 11 games in a season if they beat Washington.
* Texas last finished in the Top 10 in 1983, that will change
if they win this game.
* Texas has received commitments in the last few days from Marco
Martin, super dt out of Div.1 5-A State Champion Mesquite, the
#1 dt recruit in all the land Rodrique Wright out of Alief Hastings,
the #1 player in the state of Oklahoma,  de Bryan Pickryl, and
the #1 rb in Texas, Albert Hardy of Galena Park. Texas already
has the #1 recruiting class in the country right now, and 1 or
2 more of these guys could make the best class to EVER sign with
Texas.
* Washington has had an interesting few weeks since the Miami
game. 1st, backup tight end Kevin Ware, from Spring, TX by the
way, was suspended indefinitely for violating team rules.
Attacking police officers is never a good idea, my man. I hope
he gets himself straightened out, he's a player. Meanwhile, back
up qb Taylor Barton and 2 walk-ons were arrested on the University
of the Pacific campus for trespassing after refusing to leave the
grounds. I'm sure they had their reasons...
So now Washington is left with 2 options at 2nd team qb: Casey
Paus, who is redshirting this season and would lose it for even
1 play, or Adam Seery, a converted linebacker who hasn't thrown
a pass or lettered in his 3 years at Udub.  Now this is a qb
controversy. With the way their o-line plays, all 3 might see
the field and/or the medical personnel.
* Washington had 4 All-Americans this year: dt Larry Tripplett
(3rd team), and wr Reggie Williams, kr Charles Frederick
(both 1st team Freshman All-America),  and punter Derek McLaughlin
(2nd team Freshman All-America).
* The Huskies beat 3 top 11 teams this season
(#11 Michigan, #10 Stanford, #9 Washington State).
* Washington gave up more points than the scored this season.
They average 28.2 points per game, while giving up 29.4. That
tells me you when win you win close, and when you lose, you
lose big.

Around the Conference:
The Bowl Matchups (in the order picked by the Conference):

The Rose Bowl- Miami v. Nebraska - Jan. 3rd
Will karma catch the Huskers? Yes. If the Hurricanes were in the
NFC east, they would have won the division by Thanksgiving.

The Fiesta Bowl- Colorado v. Oregon - Jan. 1st
The best game of the big 4, CU's running game vs. Mike Belotti's
brain. Oregon will have to find away to stop the run, something
they haven't had to do all year.

The Cotton Bowl- Oklahoma v. Arkansas - Jan. 1st
The inverted Longhorn Hand Sign Bowl. The good news is one of
these teams HAS to lose. Coach Bob v. The Nutt, yuck. Moving on...

The Alamo Bowl- Texas Tech v. Iowa - Dec. 29th
This should be a good one. Tech's offense on indoor turf should
be too much for the Hawkeyes. Watch out for the goal posts,
Hawkeyes...

The Insight.com Bowl- Kansas St. v. Syracuse - Dec. 29th
Which Wildcat team will show up? It will be easy to tell: K-State
wins bowl games in blowouts, and loses the close ones.

The MainStay Independence Bowl- Iowa St. v. Alabama - Dec. 27th
The line has Alabama by 6 1/2, but I disagree. This is a well
coached and veteran Cyclone team. They will give Bama all they
can handle.

The Galleryfurniture.com Bowl- Texas A&M v. TCU - Dec. 29th
Whew. A renewal of a classic rivalry from the old days of the
SWC, can TCU... I can't do this. NO ONE CARES. Lose and go away.


That's it for now. I will talk to you after the bowl games.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

"Access Card Information","
Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

> This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.
> America: The Good Neighbor.
> Widespread but only partial news coverage was given
> recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
> Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television
> Commentator. What follows is the full text of his
> trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional
> Record:
> ""This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
> Americans as the most generous and possibly the
> least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany,
> Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy
> were lifted out of the debris of war by the
> Americans who poured in billions of dollars and
> forgave other billions in debts.
>
> None of these countries is today paying even the
> interest on its remaining debts to the United
> States. When France was in danger of collapsing in
> 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and
> their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
> streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.
>
> When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the
> United States that hurries in to help. This spring,
> 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.
> Nobody helped. The Marshall Plan and the Truman
> Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
> countries. Now newspapers in those countries are
> writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.

> I'd like to see just one of those countries that is

> Douglas DC10?
>
> If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the
> International lines except Russia fly American
> Planes? Why does no other land on earth even
> consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You
> talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
> You talk about German technocracy, and you get
> automobiles. You talk about American technocracy,
> and you find men on the moon - not once, but several
> times - and safely home again.
>
> You talk about scandals, and the Americans put
> theirs right in the store window for everybody to
> look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
> and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most
> of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are
> getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to
> spend here.
>
> When the railways of France, Germany and India were
> breaking down through age, it was the Americans who
> rebuilt them When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the
> New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an
> old caboose. Both are still broke.
>
> I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced
> to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name
> me even one time when someone else raced to the
> Americans in trouble? I don't think there was
> outside help even during the San Francisco

>
> Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one
> Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

It was nice to see everybody play this weekend, and I do mean
EVERYBODY. I think that even I had a few carries, and my wife
had a sack. Good to see Major get one more score, and then
launch the ball 60 rows into the student section. There is no
football game this weekend, but there is plenty going on with
the Longhorns. The basketball season opens the T.J. Ford Era
on Saturday as the 'horns face giant killer Arizona, who already
has beaten #3 Maryland and #9 Florida, all with replacing 4
NBA-bound starters. If you are around Austin Saturday, get
yourself to the basketball game. Let's make it as hard to play
in the Drum as it is in DKR. There is that little matter of OU
going out to Lubbock to play Tech on Saturday as well. Get your
guns up, Longhorns.

59-0

What can I say about this? COMPLETE DOMINATION. Utterly complete.
The 'horns rolled up 606 yards total offense, all three quarterbacks
accounted for touchdowns, every single player who is not redshirting
played. The Defense seems to be getting nastier each week. The
Jayhawks had 67 yards of total offense. 67 yards. The closest
they got to the endzone was the Texas 48. Special teams standout
Michael Ungar outscored Kansas all by himself with a safety of the
Jayhawk punter who bobbled the snap in the endzone. Ungar beat
Kansas, 2-0. Texas also had another safety when Marcus Tubbs sacked
quarterback Mario Kinsey in the endzone, so I guess Tubbs beat
Kansas, too. If Texas wanted to score 100 on Saturday, they would
have made it so. The Jayhawks, in my opinion, quit on their
interim coach Saturday. They came out flat, played flat, and were
immediately flattened by a fired up Texas team ready to honor their
seniors by getting all of them in the game. The only down side to
this game was the kickoff coverage. Kansas seemed to get through
the initial wall and get the ball close to midfield almost every
time. I think this was due to two things:
1. The kickoff coverage team was looking for the knockout blow
that would make SportsCenter
2. They were all exhausted from covering 10 kicks in the game.
I think this problem was unique to the blowout, and will correct
itself by the Aggie game. If that's my worst complaint, then I
guess it's a good day.

The BCS, OU vs. Tech, Bowl Theories

Let's talk about the BCS for a minute. I've heard from some of
you that you don't like the BCS. I concur. I don't see how they
can tell a team it must play in a major conference to be eligible
(BYU will be snubbed due to this), and then amend the rules to
filter it ""fairly"". See, only 2 teams from one conference can
play in the BCS. The BCS was installed to eliminate the bias of
voters and make sure the best teams make it to the top 4 bowls.
With that being said, how can the NCAA use this system and then
turn around and say, ""Oh, I'm sorry, but we can only have 2 teams
from one conference. 3 teams would allow too much money to go to
one conference, and that's not fair."" Excuse me? Why does it have
to be fair here? Is it fair that Notre Dame has it's own TV deal
with NBC while better teams never get seen? They make A LOT of
money that other schools don't. Is it fair that one BCS-factoring
poll in Seattle has a 9-1 Pac-10 team at #2, and an Atlanta-based
poll has an 8-1 SEC team #2 (Oregon and Florida have both jumped
Texas in the BCS this week)? Maybe the Dallas Morning News should
start a BCS poll to even the score with it's own polling methods.
It's not fair anywhere in college football, it's not supposed to
be. The Big 10 shouldn't be guaranteed a team in the BCS if they
can't produce 1 in the top 10, penalizing another that has 3. No
conference should. College football is eliminate the weak and
the strong survive, so why be ""fair"" in deciding a national champion?
It is a shame that Texas, Oklahoma or Nebraska will get left out
so it will be ""fair."" I will get off of my soapbox.

Like I stated earlier, get your guns up, people. I am officially
jumping on the Texas Tech bandwagon now. One way, please, and
I'd like a window seat, maybe in the emergency exit row?
There's plenty of room for everybody. The Sooners are 8-point
favorites in Lubbock this weekend, but it should be fun to watch
Kliff with a K throwing it all over the place. We really NEED
this game. If Tech can pull this off, Texas plays the Aggies for
the right to go to Dallas. If Tech loses, then Texas has to hope
Nebraska beats OU in the Big XII Championship Game, and the 'horns
get the BCS nod over the 2-loss Sooners, which could happen.
Prepare yourself for this:
Texas will not make the BCS. If OU wins out and beats Nebraska
in Dallas, those 2 will certainly make it to the BCS. In that
case, Texas will end up in Dallas in the Cotton Bowl vs. an SEC
team (Ole Miss or Auburn). I know this isn't the place most of
us want to go, but it might be where we do go. Now Dallas isn't
exactly the end-of-season goal that Texas had in mind, but they
will shake it off and play where they are sent. Many of you
(and I do mean many) have proposed theories and explanations to
me as to why the 'horns would end up BCS-less: the soft schedule,
starting the wrong quarterback, the wrong tailback, not throwing
deep, not running up the middle, and on and on. Some of these
are solid, valid reasons that I cannot argue with, and some are
not.  Whatever the case, no one can change what has (might)
happened, but we can all affect the future.  The Cotton Bowl is
a major bowl, on New Year's Day, national telecast against a
quality team. I, for one, would love to rinse that Arkansas taste
out of my mouth. It will be hard for me to complain about an 11-1
season and a #3 final ranking after a big win over Ole Miss in
Dallas. I think most of you, like me, think of the sour ending to
the 1999 season and associate that with the Cotton Bowl. Don't.
It isn't 1999, and we will not be there because we limped to the
finish (like then), we will be there as arguably the best team in
the country and winners of 6 straight (no offense, Ags) who were
snubbed due to a technicality. Dallas is close. Dallas is fun.
Again, I will get off of my soapbox.

Here are the directions to the tailgate again for Texas A&M.
It will be located in lot 97, near Reed Arena (the basketball
stadium) and the Varsity Tennis Center. There is a map below.
When clicking on the map, lot 97 is located on John Kimbrough
Blvd, in grid D-4 (numbers are vertical, letters horizontal),
southwest of Kyle Field (in this map, north is the top right
corner, south bottom left, west top left, east bottom right).
If you go to the bottom left of the map, you can enlarge it.
John Kimbrough turns into Joe Routt after you cross Welborn
Rd (FM 2154). Kyle Field is located at Welborn and Joe Routt,
just right of lot 62. Lot 97 is about 2 ?  blocks southwest
of Kyle Field (straight left on the map) down Joe Routt/John
Kimbrough. It will begin around 9:00 am.

News and Notes:
* The defense got their 1st no hitter since last season, when
Texas shut out Houston, 48-0.
* The 67 yards allowed was the fewest since 1990. They also held
their 7th straight opponent to under 300 yards total offense.
* The Longhorns have now won 13 in a row at home. The average
score in those 13 games is 45-9, and Texas has scored over 40
points in the last 12 at DKR.
* The Texas offense racked up 606 yards on the Jayhawks. It was
the high mark for the season, and the most yards the 'horns have
produced since the 637 yard output last year against...
Kansas. Ouch.
* Cedric Benson continues to excel. Ced had 213 yards rushing on
28 carries and 2 touchdowns, and 1 t.d. and 68 yards receiving on
2 receptions. Ced's 213 broke the all-time 1 game freshman
rushing record for Texas (187, Charles Hunter, 1985), and his
281 all-purpose yards are 8th on the all-time list and 1st for
freshmen. Can you say Big XII Offensive Freshman of the Year?
* Chris Simms threw 2 touchdown passes on Saturday, breaking
Major Applewhite's school record of 20 (1999)for a season. Simms
now has 22 this season with 1 game to go.
* Roy Williams is good. Roy W moved into 2nd place on the all-time
touchdown receptions list. The 68-yarder marked his
15th career touchdown reception, 1 behind the leader
(Mike Adams, 16, 1992-96).
This guy is a sophomore. Yikes.
* Place kicker Dusty Mangum had 11 points (5 xp, 2 fg) to give
him 11 points for the day. Mangum now has 87 for the season,
making him the all-time leading scorer for a freshman
(Phil Dawson, 80, 1994).
* Wide out B.J. Johnson extended his streak of games with a
reception to 22, which is a record to start a career. He is 4
behind the all-time leader of consecutive games with a catch,
Mike Adams (1995-96).

Around the Conference:
* Nice offense, Ags. The A&M Aggies couldn't hold onto a 10 point
1st quarter lead in Norman, and were eventually blown out by OU,
31-10. The Aggie defense scored the only touchdown for A&M, as
the farmer offense continues to struggle. Once again, the A&M
offense managed 3 more points than I scored this weekend. No more
complaining about trick plays, Coach Bob. Coach Bob (and some
players) blew up after they lost to Nebraska on the reverse pass
for a touchdown to Crouch (""Trick Plays,"" they whined). No more.
The Sooners broke the game open with a fake field goal when pk
Tim Duncan caught a pitch and stumbled into the endzone. You hate
losing on trick plays, huh? Glass houses, big rocks, everybody
duck...
* Kliff Kingsbury went off in Stillwater. Kliff with a K threw
for 440 yards and 4 scores as the Red Raiders won their 3rd
straight, beating OSU 49-30. This week Coach Bob visits the
TortillaDome. Guns up, I tell ya!
* The Cornhuskers brought the Wildcats back to earth. Nebraska
beat KSU in Lincoln, 31-21. Kansas State lead at the half, the
1st time Nebraska has trailed at the break this season, before
the Huskers turned it on in the 2nd half to put them away.
* Colorado beat Iowa St, 40-27 in Ames, IA. Buffalo running back
Cortlen Johnson was the 1st back in CU history to rush for over
100 and have 100 in reception yards in 1 game. CU hosts NU on
T + 1 (day after Thanksgiving) for the right represent the North
in the Big XII title game.
* Baylor remains winless in the Big XII, after going to Missouri
and getting slapped around, 41-24. The slapper was Tiger wide out
Justin Gage. Gage had 13 receptions for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns,
and threw a t.d. pass on a reverse. Baylor qb Greg
Cicero threw 3 touchdown passes to Reggie Newhouse.
* The Big XII has 7 bowl-eligible teams right now, with a possibility
for K-St to win it's last 2 and make it 8.

This week's games (home team in Caps):

TEXAS TECH (6-3, 4-3) vs. Oklahoma (9-1, 5-1)
KANSAS STATE (4-5, 2-5) vs. Louisiana Tech (6-3)
KANSAS (2-7, 1-6) vs. Iowa State (5-4, 3-4)
BAYLOR (2-7, 0-7) vs. Oklahoma State (2-7, 0-6)

Everyone have a good weekend.

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Darron,

Please confirm the following:
1. I can't find the book ENA-WT-SOCAL in Estate database (please provide the CP ID)
2. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PRICE (CP ID 11360)
3. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PR-OPT (CP ID 92649)
4. Commodity code: NG or NGGJ?
5. Please provide the cutoff date to determine active deals (e.g. instr_end_dt > ? 1-jan-2002?)
6. Use ENA CP ID 1305 as the other side counterparty?

If I can have all the answers soon then I think the deals move can be completed around 3:00p.m.

Thanks,
Cecilia

In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

I was at the doctor's when you called today.  Doesn't  look like we will have a Christmas baby.  And probably not a tax-deduction  either according to her.  I have been so congested and coughing  terribly. I either pulled a chest wall muscle or broke a rib coughing  several nights ago.  Lots of pain to get around but otherwise I'm doing  fine.  
 
The ""12 days of Christmas"" was cute.
 
Do you have tickets to the Sugar Bowl yet?  That is  definately a hot ticket here.  
 
Visited with Uncle Clark Tues. night.  He looks  good.  Connor got an Ants in the Pants game from him and he went  wild.  Of course, it doesn't take much to tip him over the edge  lately.  Cammie is calm and content as usual.  
 
I will see you shortly.

"FW: EMW liquidation","Here is my recommendation for the liquidation of EMW.  I would like to transact as early as Monday, so let me know if we need to clear any other hurdles before transacting.

1. Terminate all physical and financial deals between ENA and EMW. (approximate $24.5 million loss to EMW and gain to ENA).  The loss will be removed from EMW's commodity book and recorded in Schedule E. This creates a payable on ENA and a receivable on EMW.  Jeff - can  you help create a document that terminates all transactions with ENA starting in Feb 02?

2. Sell all NSS inventory to PGL at current market price (expected proceeds $24 million in Cash).  I think both parties are agreeable to using the relevant published Gas Daily price on the trade date. EMW will generate transaction confirmation under the master purchase agreement

4. Cash proceeds will be used to pay down I\C payable with ENA.  Cash will be expected on trade date.

5. EMW will continue to show its receivable from ENA from the termination of the hedges and the I\C payable to ENA on its balance sheet.  Accounting is researching if netting these amounts is appropriate.  EMW will carefully monitor these balances.  It is important that the I\C balance not be reduced to an amount less than its receivable to ENA.  Additional income \ cash generated in EMW will be moved to enovate to prevent future I\C pay down.  We hope to have the accounting for Dec activity finished soon.

EMW's books will be left with some demand charge related to the Trunkline deal and may have some other ""sleaving"" transactions such as the ROG transaction.  I will work with Phyllis and Mark to finalize the NSS program Year 2 and calculate a demand credit, if any, to PGL.  I expect EMW to remain dormant, except for the above, until a final decision is made on it status.

His list does not include any of the transport positions.  It also includes some deals with the Chicago office that should not be included in the deal value.

"Wednesday's  Activity Recap","Jim @ Kaztex bought 20/d NBPL @ Harper on our behalf from Tenaska.  Jim sold it to us at his cost, he said--$1.84.  Said yesterday's deal was at 2 cents over his cost, but that you had done him a favor and that he also owed us one related to something Patrice had done for him, so that 'we're even' now.  
Shelly @ MRT called to say that she wouldn't be needing the second package of 5000 for the weekend.  As you know, this set in motion quite the adventure.  
Reliant informed us that Domtar was not taking gas, and we had to get an additional 10/d for the weekend off their system.  Here's how we got rid of the 5 not taken by MRT and the 10 not taken by Domtar:
Sinha @ Aquila bought 3126 of North at 1.65.  Deal ticket #1182363.
Sylvia took the remaing 6874 of North, plus 5172 combined Flex & South and moved them to Laquiba (sp?) for sale to OG&E, incurring fuel of 1.3% plus $0.02 transport charge.  Sylvia sold the delivered volume of 11718 to OG&E for $1.85, deal ticket # 1182441.  Later in the day Reliant told us that we had been cut at Laquiba--only 2/d of flow there for the weekend, so we had to find another home for the remaining 9718/d.  Ended up taking the remainder to Enogex @ Chandler.  Souad handled the nominations; Bonnie was also involved in the gas control issues as well.
Spoke with Bonnie about the Domtar buyback ticket (Tammy was sick today).  Bonnie knew nothing about it.  Bonnie said that we needed to wait until she could see all of the deal tickets in Sitara.  Given Bonnie's and our lack of familarity with the Domtar provisions, we decided to wait until Monday to enter the Domtar side of the deal with your assistance.
Melinda @ MidAm called to get our offer on 50 contracts of the Dec-Aug NYMEX swap.  Dutch quoted at $0.35, with $2.82 on the front.  Melinda held off.  Spoke wiht her later and she said that she'd gotten done elsewhere 'at a different price'.
Cheryl @ Terra bought our remaining 3193 of OGT at $1.59.  Deal ticket #1182379.  Sinha, ever the bottom-feeder, had earlier bid us $1.59 when our offer was $1.69.  Denver was showing the OGT at $1.60 when Cheryl called, but he was eager to get rid of it, so he jumped at the $1.59.  No unpleasant calls from Credit as of 2:30pm.
Greg Hayes @ Farmland called for an offer of 2000/d of Demarc for the weekend.  He could see Denver's 10/d offered on EOL, but explained that he was calling because he only wanted 2/d.  Asked Denver if he would do 2/d, and Denver suggested that I remind Greg that he could adjust his buy quantity on EOL.  Denver verbally quoted $1.72.  Went back to the phone and communicated our offer of $1.72 to Greg.  Greg asked if he could have it at $1.70, as that was the price that was showing on EOL at the beginning of our conversation, he claimed.  Ran this past Denver, but Denver stood fast at $1.72.  Greg did not sound happy and asked for my name and number.  Haven't heard anything further.
Sinha called again at about 9:50 and asked if we had 1800 PEPL to sell him.  Denver was done for the day, so no deal.  


Please don't hesitate to ask me if you need some further clarification on any of this.  I'll be reachable by cell over the holiday weekend at 713-213-7644.  

Hope you and your family are having a nice Thanksgiving.  Sorry that we had to pull you away for such an extended period this morning.

Dawn already notified us the other day about this but nobody confirmed me what to use at that time.  I'll change the Tagg bridge program to read OLT instead of EOL today.

We need to stop calling the UBS online trades EOL.  We also need to change the downstream systems - especially the auto confirms to something other than EOL for the transaction ID - or anything else.  I spoke to Dave Forster about this and he suggested we use OLT (on-line-trade) and OLT transaction number.   

Unfortunately the new website for trading does not have an exciting name (www.ubswenergy.com) - so unlike EnronOnline - it does not stand out.  

I realize it may take some time to change everywhere in all the systems it says ""Enron"" - but as you know, we definitely need to do it wherever the customers are involved.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

To:          All Enron Houston Users
 
Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)

All,

The last information I had on Benefits was that Enron benefits would cease on Feb. 8 and UBS benefits would start on Feb. 16.

Obviously, there is a gap here, and UBS/Enron are working to put something in place to cover this period.

If you have anything elective, you might find that it would be simpler if you were to avoid this gap period.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

as they become available.  And you can be assured - with our 25th year celebration
coming over the next several months - we've got several surprises coming.

Your unique and special customer number is  ===> CUS-25220

Our files show your data as follows:

Address: 14343 Millstone Estates
               Cypress   TX  77429

We hope you enjoy our newsletter, we try to put a great deal of time and effort in it to

We pride ourselves on the fact your name and address are not resold or given to others.

Thousands of customers appreciate this newsletter.  But just like anything else - there's always
a few who request us to drop them from the newletter listing.  If you desire to no longer receive
future newsletter issues - simply reply to this email with the word

If you have any difficulty reading or accessing the attachment file for our latest issue below
then by all means contact me directly and we will try to remedy the situation for you.
Don't feel you are the only one - we had about 45 we helped last time - 1/10 of 1% of the total sent.
Typically the problems were taken care of easily and they had no further difficulties.

If you desire pricing info or assistance with specifications - sorry - that's not my skill - for those
concerns please email  sales@audioc.com  for all your answers.

Also, we love to hear your comments on our newsletter - let me know what you think.

Catch U later,

Alex

Attached is a spreadsheet with the potential write offs in 12/01 general ledger.  In addition, I think Phyllis talked to you about other changed - i.e. we will not be booking UA4 or FTA in 12/01 general ledger.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I am not sure of the process on our end, I have submitted this information to Greg Whiting who is going to submit it to his boss, etc.  I will let you know when I hear something back from them and please let me know if there is a problem on your end.

thanks

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Subject: 

Early 'Oct '01:  Spoke with Chris to price out a ten-year gas prepay for 1.5BCF/yr (flat profile) to be delivered in Williams Field Zone commencing May '02.  Strip quote from Dutch Quigley was $3.56; basis quote from Andy Lewis was $0.06.  Worked w/Kelli Lewis of structuring to price out ten-year prepay.  Delivered pricing equivalent to $2.62/MMBTU at nominal volumes, $3.38/MMBTU at PV volumes (which is how ENA will book it).  Heard back from Chris that KMGA is looking for sub-$2.50 (undiscounted); that's the level that they've gone to their boards and passed ordinances for.  In speaking with her, she seemed to gradually be realizing that this was not reality and that perhaps they may need to revisit the price level with their individual member munis and communities.  Said that she may call me from time to time to revisit pricing.

A woman goes into Walmart to buy a rod and reel for
her Husband's birthday. She doesn't know which one to
get so she just grabs one and goes over to the counter.

A Walmart ""associate"" is standing there with dark
shades on. She says, ""Excuse me sir ... can you tell me anything about this
rod and reel?""
He says, ""Ma'am I'm completely blind, but if you'll
drop it on the counter I can tell you everything you need to know about it
from the sound it makes.""
She doesn't believe him, but drops it on the counter
anyway. He says, ""That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with Zebco 404
reel and 10-poundtest line.
It's a good all around combination and it's on sale
this week for only $20.00.""
She says, ""It's amazing that you can tell all that
just by the sound of it dropping on the counter; I'll
take it.""
The woman opens her purse and sees her credit card
holder drop on the floor. As she bends down to pick it up and passes gas.
At first she is really embarrassed, but then concludes
there is no way he could tell it was she that farted.
Being blind, he wouldn't know that she
was the only person around.
The man rings up the sale and says, ""That'll be $34.50
please."" The woman is totally confused by this and says,
""Didn't you tell me it was on special for $20.00? How
did you get $34.50?""
He replies, ""Yes Ma'am, the rod and reel is $20.00;
but the duck call is $11.00 and the catfish bait is $3.50.

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Sung to ""Those were the Days"" from All in the Family...

Only hung with wealthy friends
Had the new Mercedes Benz
Means were justified by ends
Those were the days

Andy Fastow's Porsche was neat
With LJM it's off the balance sheet
We sure were loved by the Street
Those were the days

And you knew who you were then
Down the hall, my new girlfriend
Brother we could use a man like Jeffrey Skilling again

Didn't need no SEC
All my calls deep in money
Used to drink with Delaney
Those were the days.

Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal 
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an ""excess parachute payment,"" according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

ANYONE REMEMBER THIS??
IT WAS 1987!
At a UNC lecture the other day they played an old video
of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during
the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country
getting the third degree. But what he said was stunning!! He was being
drilled by some senator;

""Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home
security system?""
Ollie replied, ""Yes I did sir.""
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the
audience, ""Isn't this just a little excessive?""
'No sir,' continued Ollie.
""No? And why not?"" the senator asked.
""Because the lives of my family and I were threatened
sir.""
'Threatened? By whom?"" the senator questioned.
'By a terrorist, sir.' Ollie answered.
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that
much?""
""His name is Osama bin Laden sir."" Ollie replied.

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

""Why are you so afraid of this man?"" the senator asked.
""Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I
know of,"" Ollie answered.
""And what do you recommend we do about him?"" asked the
senator.
""Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that
an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
the earth.""

The senator disagreed with this approach and that was
all that was shown
of the clip.

There are a growing number of things for us to discuss relative to gas
supply for Pleasant Valley Station.  I would like to suggest the following
dates to meet in Houston.

Choice #1:	November 13, a morning meeting

Choice #2:	Novemer 6, a morning meeting

Please let me know (and reply all in your response) if one or both dates
work. 

I will put together an agenda of the items for discussion.

"regions file","Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.

"RE: Season tix are in","
I got my files restored and indeed had you down for four OU tix.  So sorry.
Let's try to hook up Saturday.

I wouldn't mind help with the Foundation contribution, but the downside all
belongs to you.  I could practically guarantee that if you were to split
away and create your own foundation giving you'd get knocked out of your
seats unless you jumped in at the $2500 level/yr or higher.  Any money
given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you.  And if you
decide in the future to start anyway, you lose all the prior years
cumulative giving where you didn't start.  Any any money you gave me
wouldn't mean we'd be guaranteed better OU tix (or season tix) because I
would lower my personal contribution by the same amount.  I don't want to
be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the future
to stop helping.  That said, that may not be important for you and you
won't mind sending me dollars.

I know I wouldn't be getting OU tix at all if it wasn't for my contribution
to the Foundation.  Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any more,
so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at all.

Your choice!

Subject:  RE: Season tix are in


I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are
Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I
guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know
the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4
season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6
years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.
I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the
Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

   Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my
   records
   of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my restoration
   back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them with
   seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

   I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you
   paid
   me?

   When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season and
   OU
   or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats than
   your
   season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix
   with
   their season tix.

   I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

   We'll get it worked out

   tickets,
   could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you about
   the

      It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll
   probably
      just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day
   of
      the
      NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","This is not the regular email, that will come in a day or so,
and it will have all of the regular info, and the tailgate
information for the BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME!!!!!

Tickets
Let's talk about the game for a second. I'm sure you can imagine
the demand for tickets. The Big XII allots 16,500 tickets to be
divided among both schools, or 8,250 each. Cut 10% out of that
for the student draw, and it's down to 7,425. That's 7,425 tickets
for around 70,000 people looking to be in Dallas this weekend.
The 7,425 should raise some when Colorado doesn't sell all of
theirs (they usually don't), so that should push it up to 11,000
or so. That's 11,000 seats for around 40,000 people. These tickets
will be prioritized and dealt out as usual.You should know if you
are one of those who get select tickets or if you do not. If you
do, you should contact the Longhorn Foundation (ticket reservations
started on at 10:00 am on Sunday, November 25 and it ends at 7:00 pm
on Monday, November 26). If you are not one of these people, there
are options: School message boards, ticket vendors/outlets, want ads
in Norman and Lincoln, and most isp's have some sort of on-line
shopping sites where people sell any and everything. Believe me, I
have looked, tickets are EVERYWHERE on the Internet. Start with the
Longhorn links and work your way to the OU and NU sites, the ticket
outlets and on to the buy/sell sites and you will find them.

The Game
This is it folks. It may not have happened exactly like it was
supposed to, but what ever does? It's right there in front of
the Longhorns, and now they need to reach out and grab it. They
need your help. COME TO DALLAS. From the players, the coaches,
the Athletic Department- COME TO DALLAS. When CU came to town in
October, the game was close until the shovel pass. After that,
the crowd took over. Life was unbearable for the Buffalos after
that: they couldn't audible, they had false starts, delay of
games, etc... and they got blown out. That was the crowd. Dallas
is our town, this our state, Texas Stadium is OUR house. The Buffs
are the visitors in OUR HOUSE. Let's make it a Burnt Orange Dallas.
An endless sea of Texas shirts and hook'em horns, and a thundering
stream of noise to let the Buffalos know we mean business down
here in Austin. Let's turn Texas Stadium into the DKR-North.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. Who knows, by the time the game kicks off,
Florida or Miami may have lost, and you could be watching the
Longhorns celebrate Mack Brown's 1st Big XII Championship as the
players carry roses around and the crowd goes crazy in anticipation
of the National Championship game in Pasadena. Get yourself to
Dallas. It's right there.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. DKR-NORTH. OUR HOUSE.

Subject: Monday 01/28 - Status report of integration testing, remaining, outstanding issues, going forward


Everyone - updates from testing last week, and communication of information/ going forward.
 
Thanks to all involved in last weeks testing.  Much has been accomplished.  We did encounter a legal mandated 'test freeze' on Friday given a legal communication came down to halt all data entry/ code changes, but as of Friday evening, it was eventually lifted.  Any unfinished testing can continue.
 
We've completed:
- Integration testing of 25 transaction type scenarios - from EOL entry, Sitara, TDS, Tagg.  This includes the sample testing of scripts, and the end to end testing to SAP.
- EOL has sent 13 gas and 4 financial transactions through downstream systems.
- Over 50 integration issues identified and resolved!  Majority were data setup issues, but code changes were identified, incorrect hardware being used, reports not running, start-up scripting issues resolved, replication issues resolved.
 
What's remaining to test and status:
1) EDI testing - Tammy Jaquet, Robert Virnau are expected to complete the EDI test by end of day today (01/28)
2) Financial Settlements/ EOL deals - Mechelle Stevens is completing her verification of EOL deals into Unify.  Testing is expected to complete the EDI test by end of day today (01/28).
3) SAP testing - SAP is still in requirements analysis with regards to GL account setup, profit centers.  A meeting is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon with the UBS, SAP, Netco leads.  SAP testing can be conducted between Unify and within SAP once decisions are determined.
 
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
 
Outstanding known issues:
1) Unify custom reports (SQR) not working.  This was not part of integration test, but testing by Kelley Huntley on Friday resulted in failure.  Infrastructure expected to resolve by Monday noon.
2) There is some data setup that is being completed Monday morning and should be complete by now.
 
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
 
Going forward:
1) The Netco EOL (or new OLT?) team will be testing all week deals into Netco environments.  You may see these in downstream systems.
2) Analysis of what estate data still resides in Netco, and what needs to be there to go forward.  Namely curve data for EnPower.
3) We will perform regression testing to determine if there are any cross dependency of hardware.  Testing scenarios include:
    a) Application messaging that use Tibco (port, multi-cast addresses)
    b) Estate execution with Netco hardware inactive
    c) Netco execution with Estate hardware inactive
 
Notice/ FYI - All Netco (UBS) employee's LAN NT user-id's will be changed to a new file server (anticipated Friday 02/01).  
The impacts are mainly the O:\ drive, W:\ drive will be split between Estate and Netco.  All authorized (legal) data is being copied now to the new file servers.
For example, if Netco employees need specific files on the O:\ drive, if they are missing, they would have remained with estate.  If you have files in progress, they
may missing the batch file copy which is occurring this week.
 
Updates to follow later this week!

Subject: Status report of integration testing from Wednesday, Jan. 23rd ; and Thursday's continuation..


 
Status report of integration testing from Wednesday, Jan. 23rd 
    - (16 gas/ power types of transactions to test)
 
Overall, there were no infrastructure or major application issues.  Unlike the prior testing, we've included many more gas transaction types and testing with all non-essential Netco data removed (aka baseline for Netco go-live). 
 
In today's test, we had numerous data setup related issues  that resulted in downtime (ie EOL- Dynegy information, TGP address information, bad credit counterparty/ contracts,  or database issues with data sync/ replication).   These were mainly attributed to the massive cleanup/ removal of data not needed.  The  remaining issues open are being addressed Wednesday night.  
 
Given the deferred 12:00pm to 2:00pm start time and data setup/ sync issues, we were unable to complete downstream processes (mainly Settlements, confirmations, SAP). 
 
Continuation of testing into Thursday
We are requesting the testers with tasks remaining to complete the script execution Thursday (morning shift and afternoon shifts given UBS offsite meetings).
We will try to balance the testing activities given some will be out in the morning, and some in the afternoon.  The bridgeline will be active from 9 - 5 for communication/ status.
 
 
RECAP of where testing left off for Netco and EOL entry. 
 
---> NETCO Deal types (with Netco external gas/power (good & bad credit)
Financial    All financial testing completed!
 
Power
Wednesday       
    - Completed tasks:  Deal Entry, settlement statement group setup, notification, EnPower deal load.  Awaiting settlements drafting issue.
Thursday (remaining & status)
    (1)  DCAF testing ready
    (2) Kelley Huntley to draft invoices after draft issue resolved.
 
Gas
Wednesday
    - Completed tasks:  Deal Entry in TDS, TAGG/ ERMS, Sitara.  Port Calc
 
Thursday
    - (Chris Spears) - Transport - The TGP payment methods are now setup.
    - (Clarissa Hanks)  - Transport usage ticket for generic contract is setup (Deal 20000082)
    - ( Wade Price) - To draft invoices after confirmation of activity upstream (pm)
    - DCAF testing after confirmation of activity upstream 
    - Need to conduct the EDI test (Tammy Jaquet/ Robert Virnau)
 
---> EOL Deals (Dawn Kenne has confirmed 4 EOL deals were setup.  2 Gas, 2 Power) 
 
Thursday's plans are to confirm the flow of these deals into  Sitara, Tagg/ EnPower. Followed by eventual confirmations, settlement through Unify and SAP.  These are ready now for validation by Sitara/ Tagg/ EnPower.
 
Thanks to your continued involvement ...

This is it.  It should be self explanatory.  There are values for Jan02 and Feb02 in the file.  The value increased a little more than I expected.  I didn't have time to compare the numbers from my last run at it in December.  I will in the morning.  I also still need to find the true value on the weather deal.

It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll probably
just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of the
NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this with you
next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word on OU?

"HireSynergy's contribution to Enron's employees","Attention: All Enron Employees

HireSynergy wants to express its condolences for everyone at Enron. We have
met and developed relationships with many of you over the years, and have
heard the disappointing news with both the job losses and the invasion of
privacy by the news and media. Since Tuesday 12/4 seems to be the last known
day of employment for most of you, we are offering everyone at Enron the
following immediate services at no charge, so please forward this email to
all of your friends and colleagues:

How HireSynergy can help you NOW:

1) Resume writing tips that help you get the interview
2) Interview techniques to help you get the job offer, even if your
technical skills aren't an exact match
3) Identify specific job opportunities that match your background and
criteria (as opposed to you applying via the internet or Human Resources job
postings, and not hearing back for weeks or being completely overlooked.).

HireSynergy is a retainer and contingency search firm that traditionally
charges fees to clients for our services.  However, since most of Enron's
major competitors already have access to you, our contribution to the Enron
community is proactively helping everyone through the job search process,
regardless of what stage of the interview process you're in.

HireSynergy specializes in the areas of Accounting, Tax, Finance and Risk
Management.
In addition, we have a division that places Executive Secretaries and all
clerical/ administrative staff.

We are walking distance from Enron! Please give us a call at 713-222-7667.

"FW: PROJECT 1","Here is a test of several items you have learned in the Excel class so far.

I have set up a basic program structure for you that opens a file and reads the file, line by line, into the variable ""sBuf"".

You should write functions that tally the results asked for on Sheet1  (number of lines in the file, number of characters, etc).  A user should be able to enter a search (source) string.  Given the string you should also search for how many times it occurs in the file under 3 different conditions (case-sensitive, case-insensitive and as a ""word"" - separated by blanks).

You should have all the basic concepts down to complete the program fairly easily.  Work on this project and we will discuss it on the Monday following Thanksgiving.

I will be out tomorrow and next week.

Have fun!

Security access for the ""Estate"" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for ""Netco"" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  ""Netco"".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code ""Houston - Netco""
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Kam,

As we discussed this morning, the traders will be using their physical books to log onto EOL with the exception of the financial desk (John Arnold and team).  Behind the scenes, EOL will  set these traders up in the Counterparty Alternates table to have the books ""flip"" to the respective financial book when a financial trade is hit.  

Also, any word yet on the traders wanting a different book for price, basis and index.  We are still under the assumption that the trades will book under one book.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

"Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14","Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

"FW: Wishing you well","
As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

"Thursday Poker Game Group","I talked with all of you about having a monthly poker/cards game.  Please let me know if you are not interested anymore.  We discussed, a Thursday night once a month.  I was thinking from roughly 7:30 - 10 p.m.  How does the third Thursday of the month sound to everyone?  This should always keep us out of bidweek/first of the month scenarios.  Right now we have 8 guys, so we can go two tables.  We were also talking about rotating the location each month to someone else's house.  I will volunteer my house for the first week.  Do we want to start in September?  The third Thursday would be September 20th.  We also talked about this being a small time game, like .25 ante, $1.00 maximum.  Please let me know what you guys think if we can do this and if we should change some of the suggestions listed above.  Thanks.

"RE: Season tix are in","
I'm certainly OK with the arrangement long term if you're happy with your
seats.  I would have liked to get you down lower, but that won't be
possible today without a much larger contribution.

And I'm OK with you helping with the foundation contribution - you just
won't get any recognition from Texas or from the IRS with that arrangement.
And with the job market these days, there might come a time when I can't
continue my own level of giving and then everyone will have to make a
decision.   I'd lower my giving so that the total contribution was level
year after year.  If and when you decided to stop, I'd have to start making
up the difference again to keep my seats on row 3.  Or I'd be bumped
somewhere.

I got this many because people started asking about getting tickets - this
is probably how a lot of people do it.  I'm not sure today if I could add
any more to the general area where everyone is.  Sheila and Mark are still
getting tix.

Subject:  RE: Season tix are in


I didn't think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide
not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls.  So
just disregard that suggestion.

I guess I'm trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this
current arrangement long-term.  Because I will commit to purchase the
current two (and would like to get two more for a total of 4) from now on.
It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than
get them on my own, because like you indicated, I would have to really pony
up alot of $$ to keep similar seats.  I'm just not sure what your plans
would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them
back for yourself.  How did you end up with so many?  Is Mark still getting
the two next to mine?  Just curious.  Don't worry about the OU tix,  I will
find you on Saturday.  Thanks as always.

   I got my files restored and indeed had you down for four OU tix.  So
   sorry.
   Let's try to hook up Saturday.

   I wouldn't mind help with the Foundation contribution, but the downside
   all
   belongs to you.  I could practically guarantee that if you were to split
   away and create your own foundation giving you'd get knocked out of your
   seats unless you jumped in at the $2500 level/yr or higher.  Any money
   given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you.  And if you
   decide in the future to start anyway, you lose all the prior years
   cumulative giving where you didn't start.  Any any money you gave me
   wouldn't mean we'd be guaranteed better OU tix (or season tix) because I
   would lower my personal contribution by the same amount.  I don't want
   to
   be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the
   future
   to stop helping.  That said, that may not be important for you and you
   won't mind sending me dollars.

   I know I wouldn't be getting OU tix at all if it wasn't for my
   contribution
   to the Foundation.  Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any
   more,
   so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at
   all.

   Subject:  RE: Season tix are in


   I believe it was $610.  That was (2X$195) + (4X$55).  The two I have are
   Sec 15 Row 18 Seats 1&2.

   I meant season tix.  But would probably also try to get OU as well.  I
   guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know
   the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4
   season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for
   6
   years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this
   arrangement.
   I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the
   Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.

      Darron - sorry - My hard drive crashed two weeks ago and I lost my
      records
      of who did what and how much.  Good news is I should get my
   restoration
      back this week.  Tell me what your OU seats were so I can pair them
   with
      seats close by, or exchange them for four together.

      I vaguely remember us talking about OU.  Do you remember how much you
      paid
      me?

      When you say two additional tix for next season, do you mean season
   and
      OU
      or just one or the other?  The only way you can get more OU seats
   than
      your
      season tix is if someone else in the group doesn't want to buy OU tix
      with
      their season tix.

      I'm glad they arrived so quickly.

      We'll get it worked out

      I just got the tickets.  Thanks for sending them.  I paid for 4 OU
      tickets,
      could you only get me 2?  Let me know.  I also wanted to ask you
   about
      the
      possibility of getting 2 additional tickets for next season.  I know
   you

I'd really appreciate that you take a few minutes of your time and write one or two paragraphs with your professional development (with some personal touch) by Friday this week.


Thank you in advance,

Jose Marquez

I am originally from Puerto Rico. In terms of free time, I enjoy travel, hiking, reading history books and play racquetball, where I am always looking for people to play. Being from the Caribbean and experience the fury of hurricanes help me to develop a strong curiosity to know more about these monsters of nature. So, at very young age I decided to become a meteorologist.
My education experience starts with a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Sciences, minor in Geology, from University of Puerto Rico. After graduation, I joined the US Navy as a meteorologist/oceanographer serving for five years aboard the USS Blue Ridge (homeport Tokyo, Japan) and Misawa Air Force Base in northern Japan. Additionally, my participation in Desert Shield and Desert Storm as meteorological officer for the Seventh Fleet opened my eyes of the Earth and Atmospheric Sciences importance in everybody's lives.
I obtained my MS at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, specializing in Atmospheric Chemistry/Dynamics. Afterwards, I joined the Weather Channel as Latin America Meteorology Manager. The Weather Channel experience was great and a fun place to work at. However, at Enron I see unlimited potential for continuing growth and a very well prepared team where everybody's experiences and knowledge become a resourceful learning experience. It is a pleasure to be at Enron and be part of a winning team.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.

11-10-2001

Greetings Darron ,

I am contacting you, Darron  very briefly today to ask for your assistance.

Audio Concepts (ACI) is going to be reaching a milestone in about 45 days.

We are turning 25 years old in the audio and home theater speaker business.

The printing presses are just finishing this week our brand new full color
brochure which will feature 3 major new product announcements plus the full
restyling of the entire product grouping.  This has been a major effort here at ACI
a full 18 months in the making.

We will be mailing this full color brochure to you Darron .

We've been working very hard to make sure everyone gets one at the same time -
playing no favorites.  But we need to make sure our addresses are fully correct.

Below is the data we have for you, Darron .  If everything looks good - then just
sit back and in about 2 weeks you'll be seeing the new styling and our
exciting new products - all done in this new literature format.

Holiday-time mailing is always busy - and we want to take every possible step
to make it arrives like its supposed to.  If any of the data is wrong or old -
please let us know so we may correct it.

Your name:        Darron Giron

Your Address:    14343 Millstone Estates

City, St & Zip:     Cypress,  TX  77429

Also, if for any reason you do not want to receive this mailing - we'd appreciate knowing.

For any of the items above that need correction - please email  Janis@audioc.com
                                                                                                   ------------------------------

Also, we'll be completing and sending out our next newsletter between the Holidays
to all on the regular newsletter list.   The engineering and design departments have
been busy for many months just to help guarantee every success for customers during
this special 25th year.  We believe our new products and striking new designs will offer
all the quality performance we've been known for and more, plus more product selection.

These major enhancements should help speaker lovers have a great Christmas season
and a pleasant 2002 - our 25th year.   For Sound that Satisfies ...... since 1977.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Darron, you'll be hearing from us very soon - unless we hear differently from you.

In the mean time, good holiday to you this Thanksgiving.  We all have much
to be thankful for.

Cordially,


Alex
Newsletter Coordinator

Holiday Bowl Tickets

For those of you interested, there are still tickets to the
bowl game available. If you have not been out to San Diego
before, it is a great town to bump around, and the football
stadium is excellent.  So, what are waiting for? Sunny weather,
cool nights, ocean views and Tijuana. What else do you need?
How 'bout this- chance for 11 wins and to finish in the top
10 for the 1st time since '83, chance to win the 1st bowl
game outside of Texas since 1964 (Sounds worse than it is,
we have only played outside the state 4 times in that span).
One more thing: Major is starting. Some of you have been
chanting his name every week, others have said you don't like
how he was treated, and some of you have even said you would
boycott the bowl if Applewhite didn't play. Well, he is, so
show him how much he means to you by coming to San Diego and
watching him start his final college game.  Is it Pasadena?
No. We aren't playing for the national title, and I know some
of you are having a harder time dealing with that than others,
but I say don't look back, it's not healthy. What's done is
done. A coach will tell his team to put the previous game away
when they get to practice on Monday. You can't hold your head
and feel sorry for yourself and you can't sprain your elbow
patting yourself on the back, because your next opponent could
care less about what you did last week.

For tickets click here:
http://www.utexas.edu/athletics/tickets/football/request/Welcome.htm

The tEXas tailgate is still being worked out. It will be in a
bar or restaurant starting early afternoon. Expect another email
soon about it, along with a breakdown of the game.

Hope to see you all in San Diego.

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

"FW: Policy on migration of data to Netco","

-----Original Message-----
From: Smith, Regan M. 
Sent: Thursday, January 31, 2002 8:49 AM
To: Winfree, O'Neal D.
Subject: FW: Policy on migration of data to Netco






The following guidelines should be followed in determining the kind of application data and databases that should be migrated to UBS.

1. As a general rule, all Enron data relating to or used in connection with the trading of North American Gas and Power (Netco's commodities) should be copied and the copy transferred to Netco.  This includes forward curves created in the past and data on commodities that are relevant to the pricing of Netco's commodities (i.e., coal and oil).  Data on other commodities should not be copied or transferred for Netco.  In all cases, a complete copy of the data transferred to Netco must be retained by Enron.

2. There are three important exceptions to the general rule:

a. With respect to trading counterparties, only contact information and Enron created trading profiles may be transferred to Netco.  All other information concerning a trading counterparty, including credit information, historical trading data and terms of trading contracts with Enron, may not be transferred without the express written consent of the trading counterparty and the approval of the legal department.

b. With respect to other third parties that have entered into written agreements with Enron, such as brokers, software vendors and market data vendors, only contact information may be transferred to Netco.  All other information, including pricing, concerning the contractual relationship between Enron and the third party may not be transferred without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases there are confidentiality provisions in these agreements requiring the consent of the third party prior to the disclosure of confidential information.

c. Historical data provided to Enron by a third party data source may not be transferred to Netco without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases, the contracts governing the data preclude its copying and transfer.

If you have any questions concerning these guidelines, please contact Regan Smith at x39291.

"Excel class","I know that each of you are interested in an Excel class (along with a lot of the floor).  As you know, I have started a class with a couple of participants as a test.  If the class goes well, I plan to start another class in 2-4 months  (I anticipate each class will last approximately 3 months).  If you are still interested when/if I begin another class, you will have first shot at ""enrollment"".  Right now I am thinking a class would be 5-7 participants.  All of this, of course, depends on whether my two current students feel the class is worthwhile.  I believe it will be.  
 
I will keep you up to date.  I feel I have some specific knowledge that, if I do a good job of relaying to you, will provide a boost to your effectiveness as you move up and through the organization.  That is certainly my goal for you.
 
Please feel free to ask questions on the status of the class.  I certainly hope this works out because teaching is one of the things I really enjoy.
 
I apologize to you again for not opening up the initial class to more participants the first time around.  Thanks for your interest.

Carl:

I was recently informed via Janet Bowers at NNG that there have been some issues with regard to the gas contract to serve the Pleasant Valley Peaker.  In order to have someone address your issues, I have passed on your concerns to Darron Giron who works Mid-Market and Origination on the Central Gas Desk.  Darron's number is 713-853-9573.  I have also made the VP of the Central Gas Desk aware of your concerns.  You should be getting a call from Darron in the next couple of days after he has had a chance to get up to speed on the transaction.

I am now doing long term power marketing in the ECAR region and thought it was best to let the gas desk address this; however, please feel free to contact me should the situation warrant.

Thanks

Subject:	Western Natural Gas Organization

	
Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

"updates","Dawn has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings.  I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again.  
The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations.  Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc.  
The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links?

We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final.  We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS.

Thanks

"Jan NSS clean up","
Here is what we think the problems related to Jan close are:

Problem #1:  when we killed all forward PGL deals in TAGG for the inventory transfer, we killed Jan activity even though most of this gas flowed.

Solution #1:  We added Jan activity back into the book and removed only the portion of gas that did not flow.  Total Jan activity was $7.2 million for NSS 2  and we added $5 million back into the book for the gas that actually flowed.


Problem #2:  We add erroneously added back Nov and Dec liquidations into Jan for NSS1.  These liquidations basically represent the inventory balance for NSS 1.

Solution #2:  We have killed the annuity to add back the liquidations.  This will create a $13 million loss for Jan.  The offsetting value was booked when we booked the inventory sell to PGL on 1/18/02.

We hope the above transactions will correct Jan P&L and the month-to-date P&L will represent a more reasonable amount.  This should close out all of the EMW activity.

Call me if anyone has any questions.

I would have expected big negative liquidations for NSS1 for Nov and DEC on your schedule.  These should have been offset with big annuities to net to zero.  Do you have the liquidation schedule for NSS1 for Nov & Dec?

"Terminations physical and financial","We just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the terminations being processed in a timely manner.  It appears that all Netco employees may be taken off of systems access for Enron this weekend.  In case this is true, Darron and I have transitioned from handling these requests.  Greg Couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and Pat Ryder and Chance Rabon will be handling all termination list issues.  Please send these lists to these three people in lieu of Darron and I.  As a side note, could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has changed since you sent it to me Kim) to these guys so that they can verify deals are moved to the proper book.  It is probably a good idea for future termination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.  For example the price book has been basically split into three books.  Please shout with any questions or concerns you may have.  Thanks.

"RE: EMW liquidation","Richard,

Upon conversation with Jeff Hodge the intercompany AR/AP with ENA can be offset.  Your net AR/AP balance with ENA at the end of this transaction should be very close to zero.  However, the gross balances with be left on the books at this time.

Second, instead of using Schedule E will you put an annuity in your book that will liquidate in January to create AR due from ENA for the value of the terminated deals.

Any questions please call.  Thanks.

Subject:	FW: EMW liquidation

Here is my recommendation for the liquidation of EMW.  I would like to transact as early as Monday, so let me know if we need to clear any other hurdles before transacting.

1. Terminate all physical and financial deals between ENA and EMW. (approximate $24.5 million loss to EMW and gain to ENA).  The loss will be removed from EMW's commodity book and recorded in Schedule E. This creates a payable on ENA and a receivable on EMW.  Jeff - can  you help create a document that terminates all transactions with ENA starting in Feb 02?

2. Sell all NSS inventory to PGL at current market price (expected proceeds $24 million in Cash).  I think both parties are agreeable to using the relevant published Gas Daily price on the trade date. EMW will generate transaction confirmation under the master purchase agreement

4. Cash proceeds will be used to pay down I\C payable with ENA.  Cash will be expected on trade date.

5. EMW will continue to show its receivable from ENA from the termination of the hedges and the I\C payable to ENA on its balance sheet.  Accounting is researching if netting these amounts is appropriate.  EMW will carefully monitor these balances.  It is important that the I\C balance not be reduced to an amount less than its receivable to ENA.  Additional income \ cash generated in EMW will be moved to enovate to prevent future I\C pay down.  We hope to have the accounting for Dec activity finished soon.

EMW's books will be left with some demand charge related to the Trunkline deal and may have some other ""sleaving"" transactions such as the ROG transaction.  I will work with Phyllis and Mark to finalize the NSS program Year 2 and calculate a demand credit, if any, to PGL.  I expect EMW to remain dormant, except for the above, until a final decision is made on it status.


Richard

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Subject:	NEW ENRONONLINE FUNCTIONALITY

In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section. In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

everybody except Todd, who I didn't hear from, which may mean he's out of
town.  I'm flexible on time & place, but Giron's on the south side, Todd's
by the Park shops (I think) and the rest are up north, so a central
location would probably be best.  Let me know what you think and I'll

How goes it?  I hope good.  I just found out that Enron is making Sprint
Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate.  Isn't this the
group you are working for now?  They will install the equipment for free
and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).  Do
you have this?  If so, how do you like it?  Did you hear about Jessie?
Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.  I have dial-up now and it
really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.
Take Care.

"Re: Pictures of Grace","I am sure you will be fine, but I guess everybody should be on pins and
needles.  You don't think they would eliminate any of the trading function,
do you?  How is the mood today?  I know my colleagues at EOL are pissed,
upset, nervous and sad.

Let me know if you hear anything good.

"MNSU","I think the D is very fast, but having said that, I still think we are a
half-step slower than OU (OU has one of the fastest D's I have ever seen
including the Miami hay-days).  My understanding is Mack held back much of
the playbook in order to run the ball.  DD Lewis still overpursues.   We
may be vulnerable up the middle.  You're right about the punting, OU
specializes in blocking punts and/or returning them.  I am glad Mack forced
the running game, we will need this part of the game to stand a chance
against OU.  Benson was the bright spot - great acceleration through the
hole, an uncanny ability to make people miss and the ability to change
speeds while looking for the next hole to dart through.   He reminds me
most of Marcus Allen.  Allen never looked fast but was always accelerating
past tacklers and waiting for the next block to be set up.

I know I shouldn't jinx this team, but I am very optimistic.  We will need
Benson's running to actually make this a special season.   Simm's is not
good enough to carry the team through the air only.   OU will have their
DBs and backers facing him while he is in the pocket.   It appears he still
locks on to the primary receiver.  I'm telling you now - a good running
game will cure all our ills.

Let me know what you think.  Let's try to go to lunch this week.  I am free
any day.

Did you watch the game?  What did you think?  The OL was either rusty,
or just plain average.  The D looked fast, but still prone to
overpursuit.  We will have at least one punt blocked this year.  I'm
still not sure the best game QB is starting.  MB is a hell of a
recruiter,  you can tell (especially on D) how fast the team is.

"Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call","Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

"unused books","
There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  

There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. 

We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. 

I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.

Good to hear from you.  I have been taking some time off recently while making phone calls to NYC.  The job market is not good up there, of course.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Jay,

I just checked my Sitara Reports access, and I was able to login and run a report, however there are still only Enron business units there, so nothing came up on the report.  I don't think the systems are synchronized yet.

Let me know if there's some other way to log in to access the UBSW testing contract/deals.

The Tailgate

We have something set up. This is not a traditional tailgate party,
there will be no reserved section at this place, or banners or flags
or anything. This is simply a place to gather and eat before the game,
and hang out watch the early bowls games that day. Some others will be
doing some more traditional things around San Diego that day, but all
will start later, so come have some lunch with us and then head over to
the stadium for the other festivities (look for the blimp, or the
cowboy hats and big white truck, whatever camp you may fall into).

Here is where we will be:
Trophy's
7510 Hazard Center Drive
San Diego, CA 92108
Trolley Exit: Hazard Center
619/296-9600

If you have a large group, say 10 or more, you might want to call
ahead and make reservations.

This place is literally right on the Trolley Line, and can be clearly
seen from the Trolley. It also has plenty of parking for those of you
driving, and it has a HUGE menu. They have everything from sandwiches
to gourmet pizzas, enchiladas to bbq ribs, and everything in between.

Be careful when you get there to look for the name. There will not be
any Texas paraphanalia out anywhere. The place is nervous we might run
off the Husky fans if we bring our gear (what a shame that would be),
so we won't. You won't have any trouble finding it, though.

We will be there from 12:30 pm on, so come out and see me.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Here is a link to information/maps for Trophy's:

Thursday night we will be at place called Moose McGillycuddy's in the
Gaslamp District. Start time is still tba, but I will let you know
next week. Here's the info on Mooses:

Richard,

Upon conversation with Jeff Hodge the intercompany AR/AP with ENA can be offset.  Your net AR/AP balance with ENA at the end of this transaction should be very close to zero.  However, the gross balances with be left on the books at this time.

Second, instead of using Schedule E will you put an annuity in your book that will liquidate in January to create AR due from ENA for the value of the terminated deals.

Any questions please call.  Thanks.

Subject:	FW: EMW liquidation

Here is my recommendation for the liquidation of EMW.  I would like to transact as early as Monday, so let me know if we need to clear any other hurdles before transacting.

1. Terminate all physical and financial deals between ENA and EMW. (approximate $24.5 million loss to EMW and gain to ENA).  The loss will be removed from EMW's commodity book and recorded in Schedule E. This creates a payable on ENA and a receivable on EMW.  Jeff - can  you help create a document that terminates all transactions with ENA starting in Feb 02?

2. Sell all NSS inventory to PGL at current market price (expected proceeds $24 million in Cash).  I think both parties are agreeable to using the relevant published Gas Daily price on the trade date. EMW will generate transaction confirmation under the master purchase agreement

4. Cash proceeds will be used to pay down I\C payable with ENA.  Cash will be expected on trade date.

5. EMW will continue to show its receivable from ENA from the termination of the hedges and the I\C payable to ENA on its balance sheet.  Accounting is researching if netting these amounts is appropriate.  EMW will carefully monitor these balances.  It is important that the I\C balance not be reduced to an amount less than its receivable to ENA.  Additional income \ cash generated in EMW will be moved to enovate to prevent future I\C pay down.  We hope to have the accounting for Dec activity finished soon.

EMW's books will be left with some demand charge related to the Trunkline deal and may have some other ""sleaving"" transactions such as the ROG transaction.  I will work with Phyllis and Mark to finalize the NSS program Year 2 and calculate a demand credit, if any, to PGL.  I expect EMW to remain dormant, except for the above, until a final decision is made on it status.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Subject:	FW: New Multi-commodity Options Trading Products


Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"FW:","Sorry to be talking business, but nonetheless find attacted a copy of the Master customer list developed in the East.  I would like each of you to forward your ""working"" customer list to Lindsay.  Lindsay will then begin to build a list like that attached for the Central group.  This will be a work in Progress so don't worry about everything being perfect.

thanks
