"More tests! Horoscopes! And a NEW Address Book!","<!--
We're launching a new Emode! And we wanted to give you a sneak peek at
what's in store for you, your family, and friends.

We've added a great NEW address book that will make it easier than
ever before to share test results, polls, and even horoscopes with
friends and family! Now you can invite one, two, even ALL the names
in your address book to take your favorite tests and laugh about the
results.

And speaking of tests, why not take one our hottest tests right now?

-Which ""Friend"" are you?
 http://www.emode.com/eredir?m=72001489&u=40565
-What's Your Theme Song?
 http://www.emode.com/eredir?m=72001489&u=40566
-Which Movie Parent are You?
 http://www.emode.com/eredir?m=72001489&u=40567

We've got tons of new ones, too. Coming soon to Emode?

-> Special edition Halloween tests
-> Have You Reached Your Sexual Peak?
-> Can You Survive Kenya? (Emode's parody of Survivor III)
-> What's Your Lucky Charm?
-> Which ""Soprano"" are You?
-> Which Soap Opera Diva are You?

And if that's not enough, here's what you'll find in November:

More horoscopes to keep up with the stars
New quizzes and polls to see what you have in common with other
Emode users
Games to share with friends and family
Better access to your personal account, so you can compare test
results with friends
Contests that put you head-to-head with other people in the Emode
community
The one newsletter you can't live without

Emode's more fun than ever. Tests have never been such a blast.
Sharing's never been this contagious. So don't get left behind. From
Kirsten Dunst to Kate Hudson, everybody's talking about Emode!

Come join the crowd!

See you on-site!

Subject:	New Football Pool

There is a new Football Pool starting up for us losers who all got knocked out (and the loser Narsimha as well). Let me know what kind of interest there is in this pool. I was thinking of doing 2 pools, another Last Man Standing and this new one, described below:

This Friday, October 26 will be the Bid-Day. Everyone will submit a bid to me by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spend' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will 'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. For example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on the Rams, and $5 on the Broncos. 

We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subtotal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amount toward the Rams.

We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Standing? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are also thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is interested in that as well.

We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.

Brad

Last night's winning lottery ticket was sold in Deer Park!   27 mil..  no,
i did not have it.........................

Also - saw Al and talked on the phone to Nita - Nita is at Enron till the
end of the month.  Glad Darron has found work elsewhere.  He will be ok.
He is a bright guy!  How is he taking all this?  This kind of stuff lets us
all know how very fragile and uncertain life really is...  and how much of
our success is based on how we see it...   or is how we see how we see it
an illusion too...  who knows????  I am just glad he is ok.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Gas Structuring is starting its ""Clean Sweep"" process today at 3:00 PM on the 32nd floor.  Clean Sweep is the process that the move coordinators have instituted to eliminate unnecessary storage of outdated material in the new building.  So, Gas Structuring will close for business effective 3:00 PM today and reopen tomorrow morning.  If you or anyone on your team have an urgent matter that has to be addressed today, please make every effort to get to us in time for us to respond before 3:00 PM.  Also, please forward this notice to the persons on your respective teams.  If you have any questions, please ask.  
Thanks,
Ed

PS  The move ""regulators"" are reported to be providing refreshments and snacks for this event.  As such, we are seeking proposals to ""pass through"" these ""incentives"" to any person or persons who would like to ""outsource"" our sweep process.  Proposals will be accepted up until 12:00 PM today.  We reserve to right to accept all or any part of  any proposal and may or may not negotiate with one or more parties to provide the sweep service.  All sweep outsourcing proposals are subject to move regulator approval.  Any change in move regulation that results in a reduction in incentives being enjoyed by Gas Structuring will require that the outsourcing party keep Gas Structuring whole.  Baseball arbitration for all disputes.  This agreement will be governed by Texas Law and we will give the successful outsourcing party(ies) our contract to sign immediately prior to work commencing.  No changes to the contract will be allowed since the move regulators have already approved the agreement.  We will answer no questions regarding the size or number of files to be swept.  You must obtain any information regarding the size or number of files, type or quantity or refreshments, type and quantity of snacks and other such data from public sources.  We will accept cash above all other forms of consideration.

I was going to callyou this evening to check on Darron. It's  simply amazing how a few greedy people toppled the Cindarella company. Mike says  every class he is taking this semester has a discussion about Enron every  day.  The law students say the same thing. I am so thrilled Darron has been  asked to stay.  what a relief that must be.   I haven't called  them. Don't want to interfer, but do give him our best wishes.  Talked to M  today he had a mock or practice interview with a Lilly rep yesterday.  this  lady was apparently so impressed she phoned her boss, a VP, and that person  scheduled an interview with Mike next Wed. Lilly is an extremely difficult co.  get get an interview with right now.  They are only interviewing 13 people  for internships this summer.  He is very excited about the possiblilites of  working for Lilly. Also has interviews with Toyota, Saber, IBM, GM and 3M.   Hopefully he will an offer from at least one of them. Have you heard from Sara  and her heart test?  Let me know how she is doing. 
Thinking of you and Larry,
Thanks for the good news about Darron.

Darron just called and said he WAS  asked to stay on with the new Swiss bank that bought the trading part of  Enron.  He also has changed his mind and now does not think there will be  any thing left of Enron  ( REally!!).  Traders still are not doing  much until management does some shifting around. ( Most of them are  now trading their Enron stuff on Ebay!!!) He said that the 400+ left  in his part of the  trading section is now down to 200. Yes, he is a  fortunate young man.  just wanted to let you know the last segment of  this saga....thanks for thinking of my #1 son.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

It was nice to see everybody play this weekend, and I do mean
EVERYBODY. I think that even I had a few carries, and my wife
had a sack. Good to see Major get one more score, and then
launch the ball 60 rows into the student section. There is no
football game this weekend, but there is plenty going on with
the Longhorns. The basketball season opens the T.J. Ford Era
on Saturday as the 'horns face giant killer Arizona, who already
has beaten #3 Maryland and #9 Florida, all with replacing 4
NBA-bound starters. If you are around Austin Saturday, get
yourself to the basketball game. Let's make it as hard to play
in the Drum as it is in DKR. There is that little matter of OU
going out to Lubbock to play Tech on Saturday as well. Get your
guns up, Longhorns.

59-0

What can I say about this? COMPLETE DOMINATION. Utterly complete.
The 'horns rolled up 606 yards total offense, all three quarterbacks
accounted for touchdowns, every single player who is not redshirting
played. The Defense seems to be getting nastier each week. The
Jayhawks had 67 yards of total offense. 67 yards. The closest
they got to the endzone was the Texas 48. Special teams standout
Michael Ungar outscored Kansas all by himself with a safety of the
Jayhawk punter who bobbled the snap in the endzone. Ungar beat
Kansas, 2-0. Texas also had another safety when Marcus Tubbs sacked
quarterback Mario Kinsey in the endzone, so I guess Tubbs beat
Kansas, too. If Texas wanted to score 100 on Saturday, they would
have made it so. The Jayhawks, in my opinion, quit on their
interim coach Saturday. They came out flat, played flat, and were
immediately flattened by a fired up Texas team ready to honor their
seniors by getting all of them in the game. The only down side to
this game was the kickoff coverage. Kansas seemed to get through
the initial wall and get the ball close to midfield almost every
time. I think this was due to two things:
1. The kickoff coverage team was looking for the knockout blow
that would make SportsCenter
2. They were all exhausted from covering 10 kicks in the game.
I think this problem was unique to the blowout, and will correct
itself by the Aggie game. If that's my worst complaint, then I
guess it's a good day.

The BCS, OU vs. Tech, Bowl Theories

Let's talk about the BCS for a minute. I've heard from some of
you that you don't like the BCS. I concur. I don't see how they
can tell a team it must play in a major conference to be eligible
(BYU will be snubbed due to this), and then amend the rules to
filter it ""fairly"". See, only 2 teams from one conference can
play in the BCS. The BCS was installed to eliminate the bias of
voters and make sure the best teams make it to the top 4 bowls.
With that being said, how can the NCAA use this system and then
turn around and say, ""Oh, I'm sorry, but we can only have 2 teams
from one conference. 3 teams would allow too much money to go to
one conference, and that's not fair."" Excuse me? Why does it have
to be fair here? Is it fair that Notre Dame has it's own TV deal
with NBC while better teams never get seen? They make A LOT of
money that other schools don't. Is it fair that one BCS-factoring
poll in Seattle has a 9-1 Pac-10 team at #2, and an Atlanta-based
poll has an 8-1 SEC team #2 (Oregon and Florida have both jumped
Texas in the BCS this week)? Maybe the Dallas Morning News should
start a BCS poll to even the score with it's own polling methods.
It's not fair anywhere in college football, it's not supposed to
be. The Big 10 shouldn't be guaranteed a team in the BCS if they
can't produce 1 in the top 10, penalizing another that has 3. No
conference should. College football is eliminate the weak and
the strong survive, so why be ""fair"" in deciding a national champion?
It is a shame that Texas, Oklahoma or Nebraska will get left out
so it will be ""fair."" I will get off of my soapbox.

Like I stated earlier, get your guns up, people. I am officially
jumping on the Texas Tech bandwagon now. One way, please, and
I'd like a window seat, maybe in the emergency exit row?
There's plenty of room for everybody. The Sooners are 8-point
favorites in Lubbock this weekend, but it should be fun to watch
Kliff with a K throwing it all over the place. We really NEED
this game. If Tech can pull this off, Texas plays the Aggies for
the right to go to Dallas. If Tech loses, then Texas has to hope
Nebraska beats OU in the Big XII Championship Game, and the 'horns
get the BCS nod over the 2-loss Sooners, which could happen.
Prepare yourself for this:
Texas will not make the BCS. If OU wins out and beats Nebraska
in Dallas, those 2 will certainly make it to the BCS. In that
case, Texas will end up in Dallas in the Cotton Bowl vs. an SEC
team (Ole Miss or Auburn). I know this isn't the place most of
us want to go, but it might be where we do go. Now Dallas isn't
exactly the end-of-season goal that Texas had in mind, but they
will shake it off and play where they are sent. Many of you
(and I do mean many) have proposed theories and explanations to
me as to why the 'horns would end up BCS-less: the soft schedule,
starting the wrong quarterback, the wrong tailback, not throwing
deep, not running up the middle, and on and on. Some of these
are solid, valid reasons that I cannot argue with, and some are
not.  Whatever the case, no one can change what has (might)
happened, but we can all affect the future.  The Cotton Bowl is
a major bowl, on New Year's Day, national telecast against a
quality team. I, for one, would love to rinse that Arkansas taste
out of my mouth. It will be hard for me to complain about an 11-1
season and a #3 final ranking after a big win over Ole Miss in
Dallas. I think most of you, like me, think of the sour ending to
the 1999 season and associate that with the Cotton Bowl. Don't.
It isn't 1999, and we will not be there because we limped to the
finish (like then), we will be there as arguably the best team in
the country and winners of 6 straight (no offense, Ags) who were
snubbed due to a technicality. Dallas is close. Dallas is fun.
Again, I will get off of my soapbox.

Here are the directions to the tailgate again for Texas A&M.
It will be located in lot 97, near Reed Arena (the basketball
stadium) and the Varsity Tennis Center. There is a map below.
When clicking on the map, lot 97 is located on John Kimbrough
Blvd, in grid D-4 (numbers are vertical, letters horizontal),
southwest of Kyle Field (in this map, north is the top right
corner, south bottom left, west top left, east bottom right).
If you go to the bottom left of the map, you can enlarge it.
John Kimbrough turns into Joe Routt after you cross Welborn
Rd (FM 2154). Kyle Field is located at Welborn and Joe Routt,
just right of lot 62. Lot 97 is about 2 ?  blocks southwest
of Kyle Field (straight left on the map) down Joe Routt/John
Kimbrough. It will begin around 9:00 am.

News and Notes:
* The defense got their 1st no hitter since last season, when
Texas shut out Houston, 48-0.
* The 67 yards allowed was the fewest since 1990. They also held
their 7th straight opponent to under 300 yards total offense.
* The Longhorns have now won 13 in a row at home. The average
score in those 13 games is 45-9, and Texas has scored over 40
points in the last 12 at DKR.
* The Texas offense racked up 606 yards on the Jayhawks. It was
the high mark for the season, and the most yards the 'horns have
produced since the 637 yard output last year against...
Kansas. Ouch.
* Cedric Benson continues to excel. Ced had 213 yards rushing on
28 carries and 2 touchdowns, and 1 t.d. and 68 yards receiving on
2 receptions. Ced's 213 broke the all-time 1 game freshman
rushing record for Texas (187, Charles Hunter, 1985), and his
281 all-purpose yards are 8th on the all-time list and 1st for
freshmen. Can you say Big XII Offensive Freshman of the Year?
* Chris Simms threw 2 touchdown passes on Saturday, breaking
Major Applewhite's school record of 20 (1999)for a season. Simms
now has 22 this season with 1 game to go.
* Roy Williams is good. Roy W moved into 2nd place on the all-time
touchdown receptions list. The 68-yarder marked his
15th career touchdown reception, 1 behind the leader
(Mike Adams, 16, 1992-96).
This guy is a sophomore. Yikes.
* Place kicker Dusty Mangum had 11 points (5 xp, 2 fg) to give
him 11 points for the day. Mangum now has 87 for the season,
making him the all-time leading scorer for a freshman
(Phil Dawson, 80, 1994).
* Wide out B.J. Johnson extended his streak of games with a
reception to 22, which is a record to start a career. He is 4
behind the all-time leader of consecutive games with a catch,
Mike Adams (1995-96).

Around the Conference:
* Nice offense, Ags. The A&M Aggies couldn't hold onto a 10 point
1st quarter lead in Norman, and were eventually blown out by OU,
31-10. The Aggie defense scored the only touchdown for A&M, as
the farmer offense continues to struggle. Once again, the A&M
offense managed 3 more points than I scored this weekend. No more
complaining about trick plays, Coach Bob. Coach Bob (and some
players) blew up after they lost to Nebraska on the reverse pass
for a touchdown to Crouch (""Trick Plays,"" they whined). No more.
The Sooners broke the game open with a fake field goal when pk
Tim Duncan caught a pitch and stumbled into the endzone. You hate
losing on trick plays, huh? Glass houses, big rocks, everybody
duck...
* Kliff Kingsbury went off in Stillwater. Kliff with a K threw
for 440 yards and 4 scores as the Red Raiders won their 3rd
straight, beating OSU 49-30. This week Coach Bob visits the
TortillaDome. Guns up, I tell ya!
* The Cornhuskers brought the Wildcats back to earth. Nebraska
beat KSU in Lincoln, 31-21. Kansas State lead at the half, the
1st time Nebraska has trailed at the break this season, before
the Huskers turned it on in the 2nd half to put them away.
* Colorado beat Iowa St, 40-27 in Ames, IA. Buffalo running back
Cortlen Johnson was the 1st back in CU history to rush for over
100 and have 100 in reception yards in 1 game. CU hosts NU on
T + 1 (day after Thanksgiving) for the right represent the North
in the Big XII title game.
* Baylor remains winless in the Big XII, after going to Missouri
and getting slapped around, 41-24. The slapper was Tiger wide out
Justin Gage. Gage had 13 receptions for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns,
and threw a t.d. pass on a reverse. Baylor qb Greg
Cicero threw 3 touchdown passes to Reggie Newhouse.
* The Big XII has 7 bowl-eligible teams right now, with a possibility
for K-St to win it's last 2 and make it 8.

This week's games (home team in Caps):

TEXAS TECH (6-3, 4-3) vs. Oklahoma (9-1, 5-1)
KANSAS STATE (4-5, 2-5) vs. Louisiana Tech (6-3)
KANSAS (2-7, 1-6) vs. Iowa State (5-4, 3-4)
BAYLOR (2-7, 0-7) vs. Oklahoma State (2-7, 0-6)

Everyone have a good weekend.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
The Greater Houston Community Foundation
The Greater Houston Community Foundation (GHCF), in collaboration with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, the Houston Area Urban League, Crisis Intervention of Houston, and Career and Recovery Resources, have established a fund to provide dedicated support for former Enron employees.  GHCF offers former employees counseling services and helps them work with mortgage companies, landlords and utilities to defer monthly bills while they are out of work.   If you are interested in making a tax-deductible donation to the GHCF, please call 713-268-6458 or mail donations to GHCF at 4550 Post Oak Place, Suite 317, Houston, TX  77027.  Checks should be made payable to Greater Houston Community Foundation and designated for the Enron Employee Transition Fund.  To receive assistance, former employees can call 713-533-4598, or outside Houston, 1-800-493-4598.  Lines are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account

MDPC Transitional Assistance Program
Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church has created a Transitional Assistance Program open to both members and non-members who need assistance re-entering the workforce.

Requests for limited and discretionary short-term financial assistance will be accepted from those who have participated in this program.

"Outlook Communication","Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our email environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that we have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues. 
?	During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exchange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug, which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the better part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which appears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchange servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?	Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experienced database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Outlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchange servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected server.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use -- we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems with the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the business week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to move users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impacted users could not access their e-mail.
?	During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and dangerous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against viruses that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktops.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day.  The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but we believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron computing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this time, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as the performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the last few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity --- Firm Will Pay Debt, Keep Cash Cushion
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R. Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith and Jathon Sapsford

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity. 
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But, ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor's, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down six cents at $16.35. 
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes more than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999. 
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by underperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, particularly in today's slower economy. 
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealings with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents related to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclosed its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee-related entity known as Chewco. 
Chewco was established in 1997 ""with approximately $400 million in capital commitments"" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the partnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a managing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the document. 
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco. 
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In response to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that ""Michael Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron."" Mr. Fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partnerships in July. 
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regarding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves ""any director or executive officer."" By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumably wouldn't have. 
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a ""material"" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents in charge of major business units and ""other persons who perform similar policy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of management.""

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump
By Theo Francis and Cassell Bryan-Low

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year. 
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 million through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paired with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. 
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. Lay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, he sold shares for a total of $26 million. 
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales ""a personal decision."" Many sales by Enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises. 
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research director of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on investment ideas. 
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares. 
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment. 
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they sold 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3.4 million shares for $123.1 million. 
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company shares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the company and Mr. Fastow. 
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics says. 
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment. 
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The suit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 million of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Credit-Rating Concerns
By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse. 
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% drop during the past two weeks. 
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resulting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower. 
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yesterday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in bonds, a small percentage of a typical trade. 
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating concerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer. 
""Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest,"" said Harold Rivkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N.J. 
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a ""default swap"" -- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit being insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lucent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology company's troubles earlier during the year. 
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment-grade level. 
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last week. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of putting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its long-term ratings outlook to ""negative,"" citing concerns about the company's financial flexibility.) 
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst. ""These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels,"" said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an independent fixed-income research firm in New York. ""They aren't distressed yet, but they are headed in that direction."" 
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the company's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments. 
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacity and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets. 
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without that credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derived from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or commodity. 
""Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses,"" said Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. ""Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron's counterparties"" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with Enron -- ""is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credit analysts said. ""I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
""So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them,"" said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's utility energy project finance group. ""No one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have publicly stated that it's business as usual."" 
Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Treasurys 
Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week's flood of Treasury, corporate and agency debt issues. 
At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4.588% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. 
The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield 5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday. 
Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6. Also providing support for longer maturities, the Treasury Department made another repurchase of issues outstanding. It received offers for $5.04 billion in callable 30-year bonds, of which it accepted $1 billion. The offer-to-cover ratio, an indication of demand, was 5.04.

Corporate Bonds 
Motorola Inc.'s offering of three-year mandatory convertible securities, expected late yesterday was boosted from a planned $875 million and could total as much as $1.15 billion (proceeds) if investors exercise their overallotment option. 
The securities were expected to have a dividend of between 6.75% and 7% and a conversion premium of 20% to 22%. Earlier indications were a dividend of 7% to 7.5% and a conversion premium of 18% to 22%. The deal was to come through Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney. 
Separately, LSI Logic Corp. repriced an offering of $450 million of five-year convertible subordinated notes, lowering the price to 99 from par, people familiar with the Rule 144a private placement said. 
The notes have a 4% coupon and a 41% conversion premium and now offer a yield-to-maturity of 4.22%. They were quoted lower at 98 1/2 early yesterday, a sign that the deal wasn't well-received after being brought overnight by Lehman Brothers.

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about. 
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critics would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't figure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company. The company's ""lack of disclosure and transparency,"" he says, is ""a longstanding Enron hallmark."" 
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its ""U.S. Select List,"" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's larger but prestigious ""Recommended List"" of 200 or so favored stocks, where it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993. 
""Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze it' or `I can't figure it out,' "" says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclosed number of Enron shares. ""If that were the case, there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn't follow."" 
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week. 
""Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box,"" says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall -- throughout this year. ""It was really a trust-me story, when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust."" 
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had. 
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practices are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable? 
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company's various partnership transactions. 
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings. 
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darling, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the stock, 10 had a ""strong buy"" or equivalent rating on the stock, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a ""buy,"" though not strongly. 
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a ""sell"" rating on Enron. 
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile examples of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warranted. 
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general collapse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- particularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the companies they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees and other revenue. 
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, for one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Boston, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. 
""Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that hasn't been involved,"" says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer, who still rates the stock a ""strong buy"" with a $40 price target. ""They pay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."" 
He adds, ""We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Are we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to provide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation on the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed."" 
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron, calls his holding ""a meaningful investment"" that is ""not small."" But he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer says his clients ""are happy to know"" he has a stake in Enron, because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is. 
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosures of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, he wrote that he and many other investors historically ""have given Enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings"" and position as an industry leader. 
""There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make their money, but every quarter they do,"" he says. ""It's hard to get inside to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."" 
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains ""confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] and an ultimate recovery in the share price."" 
""I know I'm wrong on the stock,"" Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stock doesn't have much further to fall. 
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. ""Even in relative terms, analysts remain very bullish on this stock,"" says Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock on Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a ""buy"" rating. Enron scores a 1.6. ""This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out,"" Mr. Hill says. 
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped it to ""sell"" from ""buy,"" with a brief stop at ""hold."" While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her recent downgrades come ""too little, too late."" 
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the company's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said ""no,"" she says. 
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC ""inquiry,"" she asked Enron about the previous denial. ""They told me it is an inquiry, not an investigation,"" she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Houston Chronicle
Action by Enron halts stock's fall 
But credit ratings are being reviewed 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The recent freefall of Enron Corp.'s stock price stabilized Thursday, a day after the world's largest energy trader replaced its chief financial officer. 
Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, also made two announcements Thursday night aimed at reassuring the financial community. 
In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOnline on Thursday was above average levels. 
Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokeswoman said. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" Jeff McMahon, who took over Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement. 
Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on Thursday. 
Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: ""Enron continues to be the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our customers continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are strong and performing well."" 
Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as ""just more negative sentiment."" 
At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. 
Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enron, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a possible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative. 
Moody's Investors Service put all of Enron's long-term debt on review for potential downgrade last week. 
Enron, which noted that losing its investment-grade rating would take downgrades of three notches, said Thursday it will do everything in its power to defend its current rating. 
In the SEC inquiry, federal securities regulators are reviewing transactions between Enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, who was removed as Enron's chief financial officer Wednesday. Enron removed Fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility. 
Wall Street is also questioning certain of Enron's financing vehicles and is wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the months ahead. 
S&P said it was concerned that the sizable drop in Enron's market capitalization has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the company's plans to rebuild its balance sheet. 
But it also noted that the ""fundamental strength"" of Enron's energy marketing and trading business has remained steady. 
Unless Enron's rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners, Fitch said, it could ""impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets,"" which would hurt its ability to conduct business. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, said the actions by S&P and Fitch might make some of Enron's energy customers skittish. 


Corporate US on track for bailout
DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

10/26/2001
The Guardian
Copyright (C) 2001 The Guardian; Source: World Reporter (TM)

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 18bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. 
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three years, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amendment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour corporate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt ""new deal"", prefer to see increased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects. 
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying little or no tax. 
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be made retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded. 
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calculate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone, while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Dollars 671m. 
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's third largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced to sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m. 
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dislike other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capital investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They say these amount to a ""giant corporate giveaway"". 
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would help companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely to start in the new year. 
""Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of working families,"" the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of California, said. 
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Dollars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of states. 
* A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world economy after the terrorist attacks on the US, trade secretary Patricia Hewitt said yesterday, writes Charlotte Denny 
As a new report predicted that global trade growth will collapse this year, Ms Hewitt warned that the world must not retreat into protectionism or isolationism in the wake of the attacks. WTO trade ministers are gathering in Doha, Qatar, in two weeks' time to discuss launching a new round of talks, the first since the collapse of their meeting in Seattle, nearly two years ago.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C
Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy? 
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor. 
From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing way.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff member, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer. 
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is going to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.'' 
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client to restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements.'' 
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which would certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting. 
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence. 
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess at Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. It will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accounting was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explain -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer. 
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

Enron draws down at least 1 bln usd from credit lines to boost mkt confidence

10/26/2001

(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of 1 bln usd as part of moves to restore market confidence in the company. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" said newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon.
""This is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in Enron. Additionally, we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long-term credit rating."" 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Enron drew down about 3 bln usd and will use part of the money to offer to redeem about 1.85 bln usd of outstanding commercial paper, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. The newspaper cited a person familiar with the matter. 
It quoted observers as saying the move may be is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. 
The source also said Enron is talking to its banks about a new, multi-billion-dollar credit line.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse. 
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief James Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company ""will perish"" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have worsened since the terrorist attacks. ""Today, we are literally hemorrhaging money,"" he wrote. 
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL (UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,000 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expected to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings. 
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeling that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulties to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one union have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked. 
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but sometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise. 
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War 
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our annihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy some DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car? 
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that Congress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism efforts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the economy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. ""The economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists,"" says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. ""War bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."" 
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just superfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savings bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by the federal government. 
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bonds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books. 
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the company on what's delicately termed a ""leave of absence."" 
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence. 
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disinclination to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure ""unsettling,"" noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase, Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And there could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions. 
4. Gold Diggers 
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. According to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty precious-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, with net inflows of $101 million. 
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, during the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion. But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long. 
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an embarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same period, they were up 7.13%. 
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Sept. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again. 
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma operating profit. 
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in long-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningless aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn an economic profit. 
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren Jenson added the humble qualifier, ""There are no guarantees."" Amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago. 
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made progress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20% over the past year. 
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget and SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from previous buy ratings. ""We thought there might be upside to our estimates,"" noted Blodget. ""There wasn't.""

Stocks Post Gains After A Rough Morning

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pair of grim economic reports. 
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in third-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversing an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29, to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99. 
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in recent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good news regarding individual companies. 
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raised its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarded the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several other parts of the energy sector along with it. 
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69. 
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 44 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-storage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54. 
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measure also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a $100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrorist attacks on the economy. 
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily on the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American International Group and WorldCom. 
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 percent dip many analysts had forecast. 
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, the second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally associated with recessions. 
Other Indicators

MUMBAI: Retired supreme court judge Sudhakar Kurdukar will head the judicial panel set up by the Maharashtra government to investigate into the controversial Enron deal. 
An announcement in this regard was made by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh at a press conference held at Mantralaya on Wednesday.
The ruling Democratic Front (DF) coalition had differences over the appointment of the judge, with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) demanding that a retired judge of the Bombay high court head the judicial panel. The Congress and the Left Front partners in the DF, however, insisted on a supreme court judge. 
The issue was hotly debated in the coordination committee of the DF. The NCP members in the DF finally left the decision to Mr Deshmukh.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 billion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the moves were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down six cents at $16.35.

Enron chief executive resigns from board of i2 Technologies

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

DALLAS (AP) - Kenneth Lay, the chairman and chief executive of embattled Enron Corp., has resigned from the board of software company i2 Technologies. 
""This is a very painful decision,"" Lay said in a statement issued Thursday by Dallas-based i2 Technologies. ""But now that I am again taking on the CEO responsibilities at Enron, I must reduce my outside activities.""
Lay resumed the chief executive's job at Enron in August after Jeff Skilling surprised investors by leaving the Houston-based energy company. 
Enron officials did not immediately return calls from The Associated Press. 
In the past week, Enron has been rocked by questions surrounding partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by the company's chief financial officer. The official was replaced on Tuesday. 
Enron's stock price has fallen nearly 50 percent since interest in the partnerships intensified, and the company acknowledged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the arrangements 
I2 makes software to help companies manage their supply chains, and its clients include Texas Instruments, Ford Motor Co. and Dell Computer Corp. 
I2 stock plunged nearly 25 percent on Oct. 17 after the company reported a $5.53 billion third-quarter loss and said it would cut 1,000 jobs, about one-fifth of the work force. 
Lay joined the board in October 2000. No replacement was announced. 
In trading Thursday, i2 shares rose 24 cents to $4.95, and Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35.

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its problems are isolated
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector. 
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, executives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and free-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector. They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
""The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday, a week ago or a month ago,"" said Jim Donnell, president of Duke Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and trades power. 
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy Inc., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday, when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals. 
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 percent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon. 
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earnings, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse. 
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnerships managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence. 
""They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn't come through with flying colors,"" said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York. 
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits. 
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices. 
""Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear,"" Ellinghaus said. 
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment. 
""The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is overdone,"" Barone said. 
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income of $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million in profits. 
""It's business as usual,"" said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. 
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earned $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sept. 30. 
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesday because of ""dire"" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy. 
""All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality,"" Ellinghaus said. 
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday. 
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying close attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid. 
""They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit,"" he said. ""They've never missed a deadline.""

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)
2001-10-25 18:59 (New York)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)
2001-10-25 19:38 (New York)

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

Enron Broadband Begins Closing London, Singapore Offices
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will close down its trading offices in London and Singapore over the next six months. 
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asian and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headquarters.
""It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out there in the market now,"" Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie James said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires. 
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Singapore office has 15 or fewer employees. 
Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizens. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employees. 
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices. 
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that international bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market. 
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to bandwidth trading, making the markets in those regions ripe for growth.

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to trading partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conference call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California about renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the company signed with the state earlier this year. 
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's consistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conference call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, like Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure to Enron. 
""We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net exposure to Enron,"" said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management, Paul Pasoli. ""We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit threshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."" 
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be halted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a little money. 
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the state of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now than when California bought this past winter and spring. 
""Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif contracts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties to do so as well,"" said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. ""If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."" 
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its program to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is about three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capacity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the difference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said that difference, or ""spark spread,"" has grown the past few months. Furthermore, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all projects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment. 
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually through 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and won't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corporation

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, against defendants Enron Corporation (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). 
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume that the class member(s) with the ""largest financial interest"" in the outcome of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discretion in determining which class member(s) have the ""largest financial interest,"" and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both absolute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please contact Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. at classaction@srk-law.com for a more thorough explanation of the Lead Plaintiff selection process. If you have relatively small losses, your ability to participate in any recovery will be protected by the Lead Plaintiff(s), and you need take no affirmative steps at this time. 
If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel Robert M. Roseman toll-free at 888-844-5862 or via E-mail at classaction@srk-law.com. For more detailed information about the firm please visit its website at http://www.spectorandroseman.com.

TGS Q3 net profit up 22 pct yr-on-yr on higher NGL sales, transport revenues

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Perez Companc SA and Enron Corp pipeline joint venture, Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA, said its net profit in the three months to September rose 22 pct year-on-year to 37 mln pesos on the back of strong growth in sales of natural gas liquids (NGL) and increased revenue from transport. 
Total revenue grew 24 pct year-on-year to 147 mln pesos, as ""TGS continues to grow its revenues in all of its business segments,"" CEO Eduardo Ojea Quintana said.
NGL sales surged 86 pct year-on-year to 31.1 mln pesos, after a partial takeover of the Cerri complex's production at Bahia Blanca, although volumes declined as a result of the start-up of the Mega project at the beginning of 2001, Ojea Quintana said. 
Gas transport revenue rose 11 pct year-on-year to 109.6 mln pesos as average gas transportation contracted capacity rose 6 pct to 62.5 mln cubic metres daily, following a capacity expansion completed in June.

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion. 
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has ""more than adequate"" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain its long-term credit rating. 
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook for Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair plans to rebuild the balance sheet. 
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative news from the company. 
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Average daily volume is 7,832,606 shares. 
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediately. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe Enron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock. 
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks, much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of the $1.01 billion charges. 
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said. 
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this week. 
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have concerns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in policy concerning the company. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they haven't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets. 
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

Sung to ""Those were the Days"" from All in the Family...

Only hung with wealthy friends
Had the new Mercedes Benz
Means were justified by ends
Those were the days

Andy Fastow's Porsche was neat
With LJM it's off the balance sheet
We sure were loved by the Street
Those were the days

And you knew who you were then
Down the hall, my new girlfriend
Brother we could use a man like Jeffrey Skilling again

Didn't need no SEC
All my calls deep in money
Used to drink with Delaney
Those were the days.

Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.  I will be in the
great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.  If I was
going, it would be Zydeco all the way!

   Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
   little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon
   works
   best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
   around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
   Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place
   in 2
   Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

"FW: What Enron Did Right","Subject:	What Enron Did Right

A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.

Manager's Journal:
What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the
vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),
competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and
dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being
an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from
grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.

   Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron
became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor
of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles
drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements
were all a mirage.
   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under
investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts
of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the
law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve
themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an
enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.


   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and
electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open
market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to
enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.

   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,
and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have
been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough
deregulation.


   -- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the
old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were
offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system
was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you
can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that
could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.

   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its
constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,
and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's
investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by
inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph
Schumpeter called the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative
destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be
part of Enron's problem today.


   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended
the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper
company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper
plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run
all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.
Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with
inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of
""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisioned creating free markets for
components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market
terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The
development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions
of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the
economy.


   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated
environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a
single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could
be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to
the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of
alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling
switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules
or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,
and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This
policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value
for both customers and suppliers.


   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could
easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of
the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal
controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we
judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of
Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion
each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on
company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.

   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading
losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's
ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and
trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,
counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the
erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.


   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's
corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood
stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,
slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline
company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron
became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It
bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to
start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.

   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and
an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization
and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe
the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.
This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could
serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.

   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the
transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet
corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in
almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.

   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to
find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all
should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to
reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

Winning feels good, doesn't it? The road trip to Stillwater was fun.
We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of
the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma
Aggies. All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is
I'm glad we do not return for 2 years. Brutal. Absolutely brutal.

45-17

Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise
on course. Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas
adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys. The running
game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got
his 1st career start. He did not disappoint. El Ced finished the day
with 131 yards on 31 carries. His solid running opened up the passing
lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary
to the tune of 5 touchdown passes. All in all, the much-anticipated OU
hangover did not come to pass. Texas took care of the weaker opponent,
as they should have.
___________________________________________________________
Colorado
2:30 pm
ABC telecast

ESPN Gameday (the radio edition, not the t.v. show) will be here for
the game. Texas comes in ranked #8, and CU comes in ranked #14. This
is a game both teams need to validate their seasons. Texas needs to
show the world, and themselves, that they can indeed win a big game.
A win over the Buffaloes would catapult the Longhorns forward to a
probable 10-win season (no offense, Aggies), while a loss could send
this team into a tailspin. Colorado, much like Texas, is a different
team at home. They have beaten some quality teams in Boulder, but now
must show they have grown up and can win on the road. This is a HUGE
game. If the 'horns hold serve, they should sail into College Station
9-1, with a BCS birth on the line. This will not be easy. Texas has
not seen a team that pounds the ball like CU does. The Buffs are #2
in the Big XII/#13 in the nation in rushing offense (224.7 ypg).
National t.v. coverage, temperature in the high 70's, 2 top 15 teams
getting after it? I wouldn't want it any other way.


___________________________________________________________

There will be no television for the Missouri game. The Texas Athletic
Department has asked the Missouri A.D. to allow a pay-per-view
broadcast for next week. The final decision has not been made
(as of Wednesday morning). If the game is on pay-per-view, it will be
at 2:30, if it is not, it will be at 1:00. For those of you going to
Columbia, the tailgate party will be at the Holiday Inn in Spanky's
Sports Bar. I will have a start time as soon as I know a game time.
It will be posted on the link below:

http://www.texasexes.org/chapters/TexasTailgates.html

The Baylor tailgate will be at George's Party Zone on Dutton Avenue
(just east of Floyd Casey Stadium) and is hosted by the Waco Texas
Exes. Start time will be announced next week. Plans for the Texas
A&M game are still being discussed. Click the link below for more
information.

___________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Chris Simms tied a school record with 5 touchdown passes vs.
Oklahoma State (James Brown-'94- vs. Baylor). It's amazing what a
running game will do for you.
* Cedric Benson now ranks #10 on the all time single-game freshman
rushing record with his 131 yards. Charles Hunter holds the record
with 187 (Houston - '87).
* Benson was also named the starter for the CU game. His reign begins.
* Look for Texas to run the 3-4 and the 4-3 this week. The way the Buffs
run the ball, Texas will show them many different looks.
* Last week Texas A&M threw for 334 yards vs. CU. 334 yards from a
team that HATES to throw. Look for the 'horns to throw early to set
up the run.
* Injury update: Kalen Thornton (knee) is returning to practice this
week. The defensive end should be ready to this weekend. The news is
not as good for another de, O.J. McClintock (lacerated arm). Look for
him to redshirt this year, unless they absolutely must have him.
* Colorado starting cb Roderick Sneed is out for this game with a
pulled hamstring, and his backup, Phil Jackson, has a broken hand.
3rd team corner on Roy/B.J./Sloan/Tony/Kyle? Nice.
* Some Buffalo news you may not have heard: Jashon Sykes, the
All-America candidate at middle linebacker, is done for the year with
a herniated disc. His backup, Joey Johnson, was the Defensive Big XII
Player of the Week last week.

___________________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Nebraska beat Baylor, 48-7, but that's not the story, this is:
the Cornhuskers had 641 yards rushing in the game. They had 4 backs
go over 100 yards. 641 yards in one game. That's almost twice what
Baylor has for the season (374).
* Texas Tech whipped the Purple Wildcats from Kansas St, 38-19. Kliff
Kingsbury threw for 409 yards and 4 touchdowns for the Red Raiders,
the most passing yards ever allowed by K-State. The Wildcats are
circling the drain. They are 0-3 in conference and 2-3 overall.
They draw the Aggies this week, while Tech gets a head check at
Nebraska. Good luck, Raiders.
* Texas A&M seems to run into the same wall when they don't play well:
turnovers from sacks. Quarterback Mark Farris has fumbled 3 times
after being hit from the blindside, and all 3 have been returned for
touchdowns, the last one vs. Colorado.
* OU has named Jason White their starting quarterback, benching
ineffective Nate Hybl. A quarterback controversy, how interesting.


Have a good weekend. See you at the Alumni Center on Saturday!

"Wishing you a ""Sound"" New Year from ACI","January 1, 2002

CUS-25220

Greetings Darron,

Simple format - simple wishes - important hopes for you and yours.

Happy New Year to you from your friends at Audio Concepts Inc. (ACI)!

Darron Giron, you should have received the latest issue of the
ACI Confidential E-Newsletter early in December.
If you didn't receive it, please let us know by
emailing me at:   confidential@audioc.com

It's official, Audio Concepts, Inc. is 25 years young! We're proud to say
that ACI is thriving. Not only has our entire product line been completely
revised within the last 12 months, we're adding four brand new and very
exciting speaker systems. Many of you have already taken the opportunity to
pre-order these leading-edge systems. For the latest news on the Veritas,
Talisman, Jaguar LE and LFM go to:
http://www.audioc.com/speakers/prelim.htm


We're in the process of a complete 25th Anniversary website revision. There
may be some short/temporary down times. Check out the clean new look at
http://www.audioc.com


January through May is traditionally our busiest time. Why? Smart people
like you decide to invest their after-Christmas funds in quality
home-entertainment. Many people also take advantage of tax refunds to
improve their stereos and home-theater systems. There is no better audio
investment than handcrafted speaker systems from ACI, excellence beyond
expectation.

The base price on the award winning Titan II LE powered subwoofer will go up
by $50 effective Jan. 20. The new base price will be $1150. Pocket that $50
by ordering this legendary sub before January 20.

Looking for absolutely incredible bargains? Don't forget to frequently check
our Demos and Specials page. These systems are sold with full warranty.
http://www.audioc.com/sale/spec1.htm

We sincerely hope that 2002 will prove to be a wonderful year for you and
all those you care about.

Our normal Confidential Newsletter has bright colors and attachments.
But 25 years ago, like this particular simple plain EMail,  ACI was simple and plain.
We hoped and desired for our 1st customer - now 25 years later our customer
numbers are in the 30,000s and aiming to 40,000 .  Like a newborn
business or person, we learned.   Our capabilities and capacities have grown
from those lowly beginnings.  But like any 25 year old - we still
have much growing and learning for the future.  We hope you'll continue
to grow and learn with us in 2002.  We're hoping it will be a great year for our
country, for our world, allies, and freedoms, for you and for us.

Darron from all of us at ACI, may your next year be more pleasant,
safe, and fruitful than the last.

Cordially,


Alex
ACI Confidential Newsletter and Mailing Coordinator

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"FW: Leather","





Ladies and Gentlemen ... wear Leather.
If I could offer you only one tip for improving your life, wearing leather
would be it.

The long term benefits of leather have been proved by serious bikers over
many highways and many years, whereas wearing something unreliable like
shorts and flipflops means you will experience a trip to the emergency room.
There, uncaring nurses will scrub gravel out of your wounds, and doctors
will dispense ineffective painkillers and meaningless advice ... like
telling you to trade that ""murdercycle"" in for a Camry.

Bullshit. I will dispense some real advice right now:

Enjoy the power and beauty of your ride; If you don't already; you can fully
enjoy it by doing block-long smokey burnouts in the parking lot at the local
drive-in. Pass slower bikers on the right inside of the uphill curve when
they will not let you pass to the left.

Trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at the photos of you and your pals on
your bikes and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much fun you had and
how fabulous you really looked hauling ass down the highway dressed in
leather.

Leather is as sexy as you imagine.

Don't worry about what your Mom thinks; or worry about what others think.
Know that worrying about what other people think is as effective as trying
to scratch your nose in a blinding hailstorm at 80 m.p.h. with a full- face
helmet and winter gloves on. The real troubles in your life are apt to be
Volvo stationwagons, driven by some dipstick talking into his cell phone or
doing her makeup; the kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some urban roadway
and then claim you crashed into THEM.

Do one thing everyday that scares other drivers... Lanesplit.

Ladies, learn to ride and then ride often. Nothing is more of an equalizer
than a woman, dressed in leather, astride her own machine. Gentlemen,
respect the ladies who ride, for they could very well have been the rider
that waxed your fanny in the mountian curves you just came through.

Sing into your helmet. Use mouthwash first. Keep mints handy.

Don't be reckless with other people's bikes, especially if you don't have
insurance. Don't put up with people who mess with yours.... in fact, beat
them with a chain.

Ride Fast.

Don't waste your money on chrome, or fancy paintjobs; spend it on racing or
partying. Sometimes you're fast, sometimes you're slow. Sometimes you're
hungover. The ride is long, and in the end, a cold beer tastes pretty damn
good.

Remember the good rides you've had, forget the cuts and bruises.

Watch cage drivers to not signal before pulling into your lane. Be alert for
brainless cage drivers to pull an opposing left turn in front of you. May
the fool on four wheels in front of you have working brake lights.

Try to wear out the sides of your tires before the middle.... if you succeed
in doing this, tell me how.

Keep your oil changed, throw away old traffic citations.

Enjoy your bike, use it every way you can...don't be afraid of it, or what
other people think of it, it's the greatest instrument of pleasure you'll
ever own, not counting porn sites and a fast modem.

Take chances.

Don't feel guilty if you ride faster than the posted limit ...the most
interesting people I know didn't know at 22 how to ride conservatively, all
the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't.

Get plenty of saddle time.

Be kind to your passengers, you'll miss them if they fall off.

Maybe you'll crash, maybe you won't, maybe you'll have surgery, maybe you
won't, maybe you'll ride a cruiser off a cliff doing 40, maybe you'll get a
new motocrosser for your 75th birthday ...whatever you ride, don't
congratulate yourself too much - your choices are 90% foreign, 10% domestic;
so are everyone else's.

Wrench... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your hotel room.

Do not read American motorcycle magazines, they will only make you wish
you'd bought a British one instead. Read British motorcycle magazines and
laugh at how the brits laugh at americans. Stay away from German motorcycle
magazines, they are too serious and difficult to read.

Read the owner's manual, even though you won't remember any of it.

Get to know your brake pads, you never know when they'll be gone for good.
Remember, brake pads let you stop. Be nice to your tires; they are your link
to the pavement and the things most likely to save your butt from a nasty
highside.

Understand that mechanics comes and mechanics go, but for a precious
talented few you should pay them well and buy them sixpacks. Work hard to
bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older your bike gets,
the more you'll need the mechanic who worked on it when it was young and
still not paid off.

Ride in New York City once, but leave before you get killed; ride in
Northern California whenever possible, but leave a plausible excuse when
calling in sick for work. Ride in the Ozarks and learn the trick of the
curve. Ride the Blue Ridge Parkway and learn to be smooth. Ride through
Deals Gap and live to tell others about it. Stop and watch others ride
through Deals Gap and applaud when others do it well.

Do lurid wheelies.

Accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise, traffic will get worse,
you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were
young, gasoline was cheap, the highway patrol couldn't catch you, and Harley
owners weren't all yuppies.

Respect your rev-limiter.

Don't expect anyone else to see your bike unless it has really loud pipes.

Maybe your bike has a big gas tank, maybe a smaller one; but remember,
either way you'll have to make bathroom stops.

Stop and offer help to the stranded motorcyclist along the open road, for
the next you come along could very well be yourself.

Don't mess too much with your carburetors, or by the time your done, you'll
be walking home and your pipes will be blue.

Be careful whose advice you buy, and save your receipts. Don't take advice
from those who supply it for free, especially if they own a Britbike.

Motorcycle restoration is a form of self-torture. Doing it is a way of
pulling the past from the dustbin, degreasing it, painting over the rusty
parts and dumping way more money into it than it's worth. Indian restoration
is a truely refined ailment that is only cured by death or an unlimited bank
account.

But trust me on the leather...

                          region is where habits and behaviors are formed at a
                          very early age.</font></p>
                        <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Known
                          as the basal ganglia, this stubborn little area seems
                          to be all take and no give. Once learned, a habit doesn't
                          seem to want to go into reverse easily. Some basal ganglias
                          are more stubborn than others. This is why it's harder
                          for some of us to break bad habits than others.</font></p>

                          a small surgical change to the basal ganglia.</font></p>

                    As many of us are reminded each New Year's Day, there's nothing
                    quite so relentlessly and painfully recalcitrant as a bad
                    habit. Ann Graybiel, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive
                    sciences, wants to find out why we persist in certain behaviors.
                    She hopes her efforts will someday help yield remedies for
                    unwanted habits. <i> <a HREF=http://list.brain.com/ct.php?i=1227302&m=71&l=9>More

            and Stroke Risk, By Dr. David Perlmutter, Board Certified Neurologist</font></b>
            Clinicians have long suspected that a relationship existed between
            individuals who expressed anger and stroke risk. Indeed, medical literature
            has long described the so-called &quot;stroke-prone personality.&quot;
            A mechanism underlying this relationship would certainly not be too
            difficult to conceive of since the statistical link between anger
            outbursts and hypertension as well as heart disease have been well
            described. <a HREF=http://list.brain.com/ct.php?i=1227302&m=71&l=29>Click

Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11 letters in the name
""David Pawson!"" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few weeks.
Wait a sec ... just realized ""YOU CAN'T HIDE"" also has 11 letters! What
am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't
believe it! Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could
hide! But no ... PLANET EARTH"" has 11 letters, too!  Maybe Nostradamus can
help me. But dare I trust him? There are 11 letters in ""NOSTRADAMUS."" I
know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in ""THE RED
CROSS,"" can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but ""SELF DEFENSE""
has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone help?  Anyone? If so, send me email.
No, don't... ""SEND ME EMAIL"" has 11 letters....

Will this never end? I'm going insane! ""GOING INSANE???"" Eleven letters!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though ""I'LL DIE ALONE"" has
11 letters.....  Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed! Our
Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4_!

      PS. ""IT'S BULLSHIT"" has 11 letters also.

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...

"Twister Unwinds"," Hi Bruce/Edward - 

I am preparing the Termination for the Twister deal below.  Can you kill or zero out (whichever is applicable to the particular deal) the effected deals in TAGG, and also put a comment on the annuity leg to reflect which deals that payment references?  

VL2515.1 should be killed
Y05186.2 should be killed

VN4969.1 partially terminated (Oct 01- Nov 01 only)
VU4647.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)
Y05186.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)

And the annuity leg Y05186.7 should have a comment reflecting that this payment is for the termination of these deals.  

Thanks,
Diane

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Cross Timbers 1/01","Darron:
I saw your name in the audit as changing a price on Cross Timbers deal 434968 for Jan 01.  The note in the terms tab says that the deal was triggered at 8.65, so you changed it from NWPL.Rockies + 0.025 to a fixed 8.65.  I spoke to Cross Timbers and they said they did not trigger this deal.  They said the price should remain at index + 0.025.  Can you confirm this price for me?  I'm showing a $40k adjustment that Cross Timbers does not.

Thanks,

Subject:	New Football Pool

There is a new Football Pool starting up for us losers who all got knocked out (and the loser Narsimha as well). Let me know what kind of interest there is in this pool. I was thinking of doing 2 pools, another Last Man Standing and this new one, described below:

This Friday, October 26 will be the Bid-Day. Everyone will submit a bid to me by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spend' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will 'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. For example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on the Rams, and $5 on the Broncos. 

We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subtotal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amount toward the Rams.

We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Standing? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are also thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is interested in that as well.

We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.

Brad

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Lindsay,

I have saved the requested Energy Atlas maps on:  O:\_Dropbox\fraley\PDF.zip.  I have included all of them except for Ohio-IOU, Ohio-LDC, Ontario (Central), and Ontario (Western).  I am having some technical problems with exporting .PDF's for these files.  Please look them over and let me know what you think.  

Thanks and have a great weekend.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Fw: The cost of kids...","
The Cost of  Children 
I have seen repeatedly the breakdown of the cost of 
raising  a child, but this is the first time I have seen the 
rewards listed this way.  It's nice, really nice! 
The government recently calculated the cost  
of raising a child from birth to 18 and came up with 
$160,140! That  doesn't even touch college tuition. 
For those with kids, that figure  leads to wild fantasies about 
all the money we could have banked if not for  (insert your child's name 
here). 
For others, that number might confirm  the decision to remain childless. 
But $160,140 isn't so bad if you break  it down. It translates 
into $8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month, or $171.08 a  week. 
That's a 
 mere $24.44 a day! Just over a dollar an hour.  
 Still, you might think the best financial advice says don't  
 have children if you want to be ""rich"". It is just the opposite.  
 What do you get for your $160,140? 
Naming rights.  First, middle, and last! 
 Glimpses of God every day.  
 Giggles under the covers every night. 
 More love than  your heart can hold. 
  Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.  
 Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds, and warm cookies.  
 A hand to hold, usually covered with jam. 
 A partner  for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building 
 sandcastles, and skipping  down the sidewalk in the pouring rain. 
 Someone to laugh yourself  silly with no matter what 
 the boss said or how your stocks performed  that day. 
 For $160,140, you never have to grow up.  
 You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek,  
 catch lightning bugs, and never stop believing in Santa Claus.  
 You have an excuse to keep: reading The Adventures of Piglet  
 and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney  
 movies, and wishing on stars. 
 You get to frame rainbows,  hearts, and flowers under 
 refrigerator magnets and collect spray  painted noodle 
 wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay for  
 Mother's Day, and cards with backward letters for 
 Father's  Day. 
 For $160,140, there is no greater bang for your buck.  
 You get to be a hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the  
 garage roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, removing a  
 splinter, filling the wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of  
 bangs, and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always  
 gets treated to ice cream regardless. 
 You get a front  row seat to history; to witness the first step, 
 first word, first bra,  first date, and first time behind the wheel. 
 You get to be  immortal. 
 You get another branch added to your family tree, and  
 if you're lucky, a long list of limbs in your obituary called  
 grandchildren. 
 You get an education in psychology,  nursing, criminal 
 justice, communications, and human sexuality that no  
 college can match. 
 In the eyes of a child, you rank  right up there with God. 
 You have all the power to heal a boo-boo,  scare away 
 the monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart,  
 police a slumber party, ground them forever, and love 
 them  without limits, so one day they will, like you, 
 love without counting  the cost. 
 ENJOY YOUR KIDS (and grandkids) !!!!!!

Thanks.  I wanted to see what refinancing to a 15 year would look like.  I just talked to him.  Things are wierd and I know it must be even worse moving to a new group.  I'm glad you like it over there.  I guess it's just wait and see.

I got your message, but I must have missed you.  Try calling Debbie Delgado @ x39183.  She is the ADMIN who sits next to me.

If you want to just call Kai directly about mortgages, his vital signs are below (just kidding).  The best place to reach him is at 713-816-1300.

ANYONE REMEMBER THIS??
IT WAS 1987!
At a UNC lecture the other day they played an old video
of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during
the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country
getting the third degree. But what he said was stunning!! He was being
drilled by some senator;

""Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home
security system?""
Ollie replied, ""Yes I did sir.""
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the
audience, ""Isn't this just a little excessive?""
'No sir,' continued Ollie.
""No? And why not?"" the senator asked.
""Because the lives of my family and I were threatened
sir.""
'Threatened? By whom?"" the senator questioned.
'By a terrorist, sir.' Ollie answered.
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that
much?""
""His name is Osama bin Laden sir."" Ollie replied.

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

""Why are you so afraid of this man?"" the senator asked.
""Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I
know of,"" Ollie answered.
""And what do you recommend we do about him?"" asked the
senator.
""Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that
an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
the earth.""

The senator disagreed with this approach and that was
all that was shown
of the clip.

"Enjoy a Free Night for Fewer Starpoints!","
ANNOUNCING A FLEXIBLE NEW WAY TO REDEEM YOUR STARPOINTS!

With ""Cash & Points Award Nights"" from Starwood Preferred Guest(R),
you can enjoy a few rounds of golf in Los Cabos ... take the kids to
Orlando for the weekend ... or plan a romantic getaway to Bali with
just a few Starpoints(R) and a little cash!

Depending on the hotel category, you can purchase Award Nights for
either 2,800 Starpoints and $45 USD per night, or 4,000 Starpoints
and $60 USD per night. Participating hotels outside of the U.S.
feature the same Starpoint values combined with the local currency
equivalent of $45 USD or $60 USD at time of reservation. To take
advantage of these savings, make your reservations by April 30, 2002
and travel through December 30, 2002.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan your ""Cash & Points"" vacation getaway today!
Visit http://spg.0mm.com/sta135001 for reservations and a list of
participating hotels.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Terms & Conditions:
Offer is valid for members with at least 2,800 Starpoints in their
accounts. Reservations must be made by April 30, 2002, for travel
through December 30, 2002. Guest is responsible for all taxes and
service charges associated with the award reservation. Local
guarantee and cancellation policy applies. Guest will not receive
Starpoints or airline miles for their stays. Due to local currency
fluctuations for hotels outside of the U.S., the cash component for
these hotels will be quoted at the time of reservation and will
remain static until the reservation is consumed.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

      Mind machines are tools for gently inducing a calm, centered, and euphoric
      state. They produce psychedelic mandala like patterns on the back of your
      eyelids and soothe your senses with drum like sound pulses. Although immensely
      pleasurable and entertaining, they are not toys. Many helping professionals
      in the fields of medicine and psychology currently use mind machines as
      adjunct treatments for their patients and clients. <br>

      All of us are bombarded every day by noises and sounds that have a deleterious
      effect on our brain and well being. Whether in the classroom, office or
      living room, our ears and brain constantly have to work hard to ""tune out""
      these sounds in order to focus in on family, studies, or the task at hand.
      These unique music CDs provide an environment in which children and adults
      can think, learn, rest or sleep. Additionally, this music is stimulating
      the brain through the broad spectrum of frequencies and the structure of
      the music. <b><font color=""#CC0000"">Short Supply </font><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2""><b><font color=""#CC0000"">$15.95

Thank you so much.  It is an awesome letter. I appreciate the time and effort you spent.  One favor...do you think you could ask your admin to put the letter on letterhead?  Jeff wants hard copies, and I thought stationary would look nice.  If not, I can ask her.  Irena, right?  Thanks again.  Have fun in Chicago and tell Phillip hi for me!

I have created the Twister termination and will get Fred LaGrasta to sign it this afternoon. (we're not allowed to sign financial terminations down here)

PS - Richard is having some trouble with the Heartland deal.....he's getting approval from legal on the Termination template (it's a little different on the physical side).  FYI.

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"RE: CART","It is unbelievable how the management (both past and present) think they can run a business with no regard for the customer.  They have to be one of the worst marketing organizations in the world.  They have a great product, but don't have a clue on how to promote it.

Another big news item : PPI used to be the headline sponser.  They left a few years ago and FedEx came on board.  Rumors are rampant that FedEx will be leaving soon.  You have to wonder what it takes to make the light go on for some people.

It is extremely frustrating to try and continue to be a fan.

Be sure to visit this  sight.  It is very well done.  Some of you know
Jamie Wax  and  others will have heard the name Taranto because Darlene,
who taught Hank and  Mamie and will, hopefully, teach Mak in 5th grade is
Paul's wife.  Paul and  Jamie wrote the musical ""Evangeline"" (based on the
Acadian story of Evangeline).   The music is from that play.

I have seen several tributes -- but this one is really special.  New photos
of the WTC
disaster - such an unbelievable nightmare.  Take a few minutes to watch
this.  It's worth it.
-- Jarja

A  guy in Baton Rouge -- Mason Wood -- put together this incredible
montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical ""Evangeline"".
They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
up!  Then send this on.  I did.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

We welcomed the passing game to the 2001 season Saturday night
at the erector set they call Robertson Stadium. As I watched
the game from the stands, I heard some complaints from the Texas
fans around me. I do not, and will not, ever understand how a
team you support can be 3-0, winning those 3 games by an average
score of 46-15, be ranked in the top 5 in both major polls,
and be in contention for a national title, yet still have
fans unhappy. Do I think the team played perfect Saturday night?
No. Do I think they have things to work on? Yes. Was I ecstatic
that Texas put half of a hundred on the scoreboard against an
opponent on the road? You bet. Do I think this team is improving
every week? Absolutely.

53-26

This game was like just about every game played this weekend- sloppy.
Penalties and missed opportunities were present for both teams early.
The superior talent and depth proved to be the difference in this game.
The Longhorns simply are a better team than UH is right now, and that
showed. Whatever you might think of the Athletic Department and
Administration of UH (I'm right there with you), their football team is
well coached and plays tough. Chris Simms looked like the man-child
everyone was expecting from day 1. He finished the night a cool 20-35
for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was picked off once, put UH got
nothing out of it. Some passes were dropped and another touchdown pass
to Tony Jeffrey was ruled incomplete, but replays later showed it was
a catch. He looked off receivers well, once on the 92-yard t.d. pass
to B.J. Johnson, scrambled when he had to, and really only made 1 or 2
bad decisions. The passing game has arrived. It is widely known that
the most improvement in a team is from game 1 to game 2. That was game
1 for the passing game. The I-Train was a wrecking ball. Williams had
103 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 carries, and did not see the field in
the 4th quarter. He gave way to Benson, who racked up 74 yards and a
score on 14 carries. That's almost 5 ? yards per carry for the game.
Most impressive was the 3rd and short yardage situations, where Texas
fans have cringed in the past. Each time it was 2nd or 3rd and short,
the 'horns lined up in their 2 tight end set, and everyone in the
stadium knew what the play was and where it was going. It still worked.
5 ? yards per carry. Statistically, the defense has had better days.
They gave up 432 yards and 26 points. Some points of concern are the
lack of a consistent pass rush and some sloppy tackling, but the rest
must be laid at the feet of UH.  The Cougars had an excellent game plan
for Texas, and had 2 weeks to implement it. This was their OU game. They
had 2 games of film on Texas, who had only one (with no relevance, since
it was of Rice and their wishbone atack, that Texas hasn't used in 30 years).
Houston played lights out in the 1st half.  Two things coaches must do
are get their team prepared for the game and adjust to the opponent at
the half. Texas led 20-14 at the half. At the end of the 3rd quarter it
was 33-14. The Texas coaches fixed the immediate problem and stopped Houston
when it had to.  Like I said earlier, the biggest improvement for a team
is from game 1 to game 2. This was game 1 for defending the wide-open
offense.
________________________________________________________________

Texas Tech
6:00 pm   Fox Sports

This should be a fun one, folks. Tech has a chip on their shoulder
because they think they let one get away last year in Lubbock when
Texas walked out of their with a win, 29-17. Texas Tech comes in
2-0 after beating that bully North Texas, who they had previously
split the last 4 meetings with. This is about as one sided a rivalry
as it gets, with Texas leading the 50 games played 37-13. The Red
Raiders have a solid quarterback in Kliff Kingsbury, and a great
playmaker in safety Kevin Curtis. If they could block someone
offensively and stop the run on defense, they could be pretty good.
It's not happening here. Eat a big lunch, because the way these
teams throw the ball, and the way Tech's offensive line blocks,
expect a lot of incompletions and holding penalties. It's going
to be a long night.

INFORMATION FOR TICKET HOLDERS: Expect long lines and delays at
stadium gates, which will open two (2) hours prior to kickoff in
order to accommodate sellout crowds. Police officers are scheduled
to patrol the stadium block the day and night prior to the games.
An increased number of security officers are scheduled to man each
gate. For more information about the new restrictions click here:

Don't forget, the worlds largest Tailgate Party starts at 3:00 PM
at the Alumni Center.

___________________________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Kickoff has been set for the OU game. 2:30 pm on ABC.

* Chris Simms' 92 yd touchdown pass to B.J. Johnson was the longest
of Simms career. The previous best was a 70 yarder to Johnson last
year (A&M).

* Texas is 26-0 under Mack Brown when they out rush their opponent.

* D.D. Lewis recovered the 9th fumble of his career in the 4th quarter
against UH, tying him for the all-time lead with Tim Campbell (1975-79)
and Oscar Giles (1987-90).

* Look for Derrick Johnson to be starting soon. Bam Bam came off of
the bench in the 3rd quarter and had an immediate impact, with 6
tackles/4 solo. He finished 3rd on the team in tackles for the game.

* Texas is 3-0 for the 1st time since 1994.

Around the Conference:
* The Aggies pulled off the Red/White/Blue decks for the game against
O.S.U. on Saturday.  It was quite a site, and very impressive. They
beat Oklahoma State 21-7, and host Notre Dame this weekend.

* OU will end its 3-week layoff as they host Kansas State this weekend.
The Sooners were off on September 22nd, and postponed their Sept. 15th
game with Tulsa to Nov. 24th. It will be interesting to see how they
come out. K-State seems to be hitting on all cylinders as they
annihilated New Mexico State 65-0. They led 50-0 at the half.

* Baylor is off to its best start since 1996. The Bears beat New Mexico
in OT 16-13 on Saturday. They are 2-0.

* Iowa State is also 2-0. The Cyclones beat Ohio 31-28 on Ennis
Haywood's 219 yards rushing. They host Baylor this weekend.

* The Big XII went 8-2 this weekend; with 2 teams idle (OU, Mizzou).
The only 2 losses came in conference play, OSU to A&M, and Kansas to
Colorado. The rest of the league went 6-0 in out of conference play.

Take Care. See you all this weekend.

If Santa answered his mail honestly... 
Dear Santa, 
I wud like a kool toy space  ranjur fer Xmas. Iv ben a gud boy all

BiLLy 
Dear Billy, 
Nice spelling. You're on  your way to a great career in lawn care. 
How about I  send you a frickin book so you can learn to read and 
write? 
I'm giving your older brother the space  ranger. At least HE can 
spell! 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I have been a good girl all  year, and the only thing I ask for is 
peace and joy in  the world for everybody! 
Love, Sarah 
Dear Sarah, 
Your parents were smoking  pot when they had you, didn't they? 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I don't know if you can do  this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and daddy  to get back together. Please see what you 
can do?  
Love Teddy 
Dear Teddy, 
Look, your dad's banging the  babysitter like a screen door in a 
hurricane. Do you  think he's gonna give that up to come back to 
your  frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give 
up that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I want a new bike, a  Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, 
a drum kit,  a pony and a tuba. 
Love, Francis 
Dear Francis, 
Who names their kid  ""Francis"" nowadays? I bet you're gay.  Only 
gay  people want tubas.  I'll set you up with a nice Barbie. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I left milk and cookies for  you under the tree, and I left 
carrots for your reindeer  outside the back door. 
Love, Susan 
Dear Susan, 
Milk gives me the runs and  carrots make the deer fart in my face 
when riding in the  sleigh.  You want to do me a favor?  Leave me 
a bottle of scotch. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
What do you do the other 364  days of the year? Are you busy 
making toys?  
Your friend, 
Thomas 
Dear Thomas, 
All the toys are made in  China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I 
spend most of my  time making low-budget porno films.  These 
producers seem to like fat studs. I unwind by drinking myself  
silly and squeezing the asses of all the cocktail  waitresses 
while losing money at the craps table.  
Hey, you wanted to know. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
Do you see us when we're  sleeping, do you really know when 
we're awake, like in  the song? 
Love, Jessica 
Dear Jessica, 
Are you really that  gullible?  I'll bet you're blonde.  Good luck 
in whatever you do.  I'm skipping your house. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I really really want a puppy  this year. Please please please 
PLEASE PLEASE could I  have one? 
Timmy 
Timmy, 
That whiney, begging shit may  work with your folks, but that 
crap doesn't work with  me. You're getting a sweater again. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dearest Santa, 
We don't have a chimney  in our house, how do you get into our 
home?  
Love, Marky 
Mark, 
First, stop calling yourself  ""Marky"", it sounds gay. That's why 
you're getting your  ass whipped at school.  Second, you don't 
live in a  house, you live in a low-rent apartment complex. 
Third,  I get inside your pad just like your mother's boyfriend 
does, thru the bedroom window. 
Sweet  Dreams, 
Santa

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Employee Assistance Program - Workshops Scheduled","
Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

Onsite Confidential Counseling / 24 Hour Hotline
EAP Counselors are available for individual, confidential appointments onsite in the Enron Building or at a variety of neighborhood locations.  Counselors are also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week for Enron employees in all locations.  The EAP counseling service is provided at no cost to employees and their family members.  To schedule an appointment or speak with a counselor, please call the onsite office at 713-853-6057 or the 24-hour number at 1-800-345-1391.

Informational Brochures

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.

"Please read:  ERMT migration to 8i","All,

As you are aware that the ERMT database will be migrated to Oracle 8i on Saturday,
September 15. In order to start the process, TAGG/ERMS will be unavailable from 
8 p.m. (CST) Friday, September 14 to 10 p.m. (CST) Saturday, September 15.

We request all users of TAGG/ERMS to log-off by 8 p.m. (CST) on Friday, September 14.
If for some reason, you're unable to log-off by 8 p.m. on Friday, September 14, please contact
Francis Lim immediately at pager # (713) 285-7190.

We also request all of our users, both domestic and international, to please test
your regular TAGG/ERMS processes between 10 p.m. (CST) Saturday, September 15 to 2 a.m.
and (CST) Sunday, September 16.  If you encounter any problems with TAGG/ERMS during
that timeframe, please contact Francis Lim immediately at pager # (713) 285-7190.

If due to some unforeseen circumstances our users encounter major problems during the testing window of
10 p.m. (CST) September 15 to 2 a.m. (CST) September 16, we will  roll-back the ERMT database to the
existing Oracle 7.3.4 version.  It is very imperative that our users fully utilize the testing window of 10 p.m.
(CST) September 15 to 2 a.m. (CST) September 16.

Members of the TAGG/ERMS team will also be present on EB2512 to ensure that the database migration
happens smoothly.  Please note that if you encounter any problems with your testing on Saturday night,
please contact Francis Lim at pager # (713) 285-7190.

We will immediately communicate to everyone the results of this weekend's database migration.

Thanks so much for your support and cooperation!

With best regards,

Karima Husain

Subject: New Corp Login


Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...

 Hi Bruce/Edward - 

I am preparing the Termination for the Twister deal below.  Can you kill or zero out (whichever is applicable to the particular deal) the effected deals in TAGG, and also put a comment on the annuity leg to reflect which deals that payment references?  

VL2515.1 should be killed
Y05186.2 should be killed

VN4969.1 partially terminated (Oct 01- Nov 01 only)
VU4647.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)
Y05186.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)

And the annuity leg Y05186.7 should have a comment reflecting that this payment is for the termination of these deals.  

Thanks,
Diane

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

Hi Richard,

I only received response from Matt Brown.   I will send an email
this afternoon before I apply the changes.

FYI, I will make the changes to test (egsdevel) and stage (ermttest_ded) first,
before I make change to production database.

I am waiting on approval from Jeffrey Gossett.

Hi Richard,

I will be responsible for adding holidays ( to holidays table) and
removing holidays from business days tables.

I checked NYMEX.com, they didn't publish 2002 holidays yet.
I requested  via email(exchangeinfo@nymex.com) for 2002 holidays.

To what year in the future do you want to add  MLK and Presidents Days ?

Bryant split the deal so that Aug is under Georgia-Pacific and Sep is under Domtar.  So you should see it if you draft for Domtar for Sep.  If not, please let me know.  Unfortunately, I don't think Bryant wrote the deal number down.  But we can find it if necessary.

Hi Darron,

I noticed that you changed the term date on this deal. However, I didn't see it come through on the Domtar Industries side. Is this supposed to be charged to them again for September???

"Re: Pictures of Grace","I am sure you will be fine, but I guess everybody should be on pins and
needles.  You don't think they would eliminate any of the trading function,
do you?  How is the mood today?  I know my colleagues at EOL are pissed,
upset, nervous and sad.

Let me know if you hear anything good.

"Barry and Sara","
FYI:
Barry had an abnormal stress test result  and was referred to a cardiologist.   He called me tonite to let me  know that the new   scan came out normal. Although he is very  careful about his food, his triglcs and chlosterol are  still  high...those Mayers genes again. 
 
Sara also had an appt with a cardiologist  today.  She has been having arryrhyimia ( sp?)...abornal heart beat.   She is now wearing a heart monitor for the next month, having blood work done,  etc.  Sounds like perhaps  a valve problem.  Serious enough for  sure, but sounds like she is in good hands and this is not something that would  cause a heart attack ( dr's words) .  I have not had time to look it up on  the net nor call Jessie, but plan to do both.  Will keep you posted.   Needless to say, she is pretty scared at the moment.

"Continental Customer Advisory"," 
  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]      [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  DEAR MR. GIRON,      Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel:   POSITIVE BAG MATCH Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths.  Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft.   DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002.  Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure.  All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure.    Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight.   SECURITY FEE The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket.  This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002.  It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths.  This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.  Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority.  Be sure to stay informed with continental.com  before leaving for the airport.

Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon works
best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place in 2
Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

Back on track. Texas is now 6-1, and ranked #7 in both polls.  I
said after the OU game that if UT took care of their business,
things would shake out for them. It's sort of setting up that way,
isn't it? 2 weeks ago, Texas was #11, with 10 unbeatens in front
of them. In the last 12 days, half of those teams have lost. Of
the 6 now in front, 4 play each other in the next 3 weeks, and
the other 2 have VERY tricky games (#6 Florida vs. #19 Georgia,
#4 UCLA vs. #11 Oregon). The 'horns are right there in it.

41-7

Hello, shovel pass. Texas won a big game. Okay, not THE big game,
but A big game nonetheless. The Buffaloes swaggered in here thumping
their chests about their rushing game and physical defense, and
left with hat in hand and avoiding eye contact. Texas forced 4
turnovers, tying a season high (OSU), shutting down the Buffalo
ground game and knocking down CU defenders to the tune of 425
yards total offense. On to the shovel pass.

Most of you have never seen Texas run the shovel pass, because they
only did it a few times in the Spring. If you did see them try it
in the Spring, your heart was in your throat (like mine) when they
ran it on their own 5, because it was never what you would call a
""good play"" in practice. I think they tried it 4 times, and totaled
something like minus 9 yards and one interception. Nonetheless,
Simms sucked them in, Ced got the corner, and Roy sprung him to
mid-field. Two plays later (One being a fade to Roy that was maybe
Simms' best throw this year), touchdown. That was absolutely a
soul-stealing drive. If there is a team in college football better
at putting someone away right before the half than Texas, I haven't
seen them.

______________________________________________________
Missouri
1:00 pm
No T.V.

Well, the Athletic Department tried to get this one televised for
you. The reason the pay-per-view didn't work is the way it was set
up. Texas residents would pay to see it, but it would be regionally
televised in Missouri. That sounds fair, right? Okay, now no one
gets to see it. Oh well, listen to the Texas game and watch OU play
Nebraska.

For those of you going to Missouri, it should be fun. Mizzou has
played pretty well in the last 3 weeks, but it's hard to get scared
of a team that lost to Bowling Green AT HOME. Bowling Green? Are you
kidding me? Anyway, look (for those not going, listen) for Texas to
run, run, run this week. Missouri cannot stop the run (allowing 180
ypg), so Texas will exploit that. Last year Roy Williams ran loose
in the Tiger secondary, and Applewhite found him repeatedly
(7 catches, 87 yds). I see no reason for this to change, particularly
when Mizzou will have to put 8-9 on the line of scrimmage to stop
the run.

The tEXas tailgate will be at Spanky's Sports Bar in the Holiday Inn
in Columbia. The tailgate will begin at 9:30 am, and run until roughly
12:30 pm. The bar will be open, and snacks from the bar menu will be
available, but meals will not. There is a restaurant right next door
(in the hotel) that will be open for breakfast. Here's the hotel
information:

HOLIDAY INN SELECT COLUMBIA
2200 I70 DR SW
COLUMBIA MO 65203
573-445-8531
Please call if you need any more information or directions.

______________________________________________________
The Baylor game time has been set. 11:30 am, Fox Big XII Game of the
Week. The tailgate, hosted by the Waco Texas Exes, will be at George's
Party Zone, on Dutton Avenue, east of Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco.
Start time is still TBA, but I'd say between 9:00 - 10:00 am.

______________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* D.D. Lewis recovered his 10th career fumble in the 1st half. He
now is the career leader for recovered fumbles, passing Tim Campbell
and Oscar Giles. To boot, he started his 45th consecutivegame, tying
him for 2nd career consecutive starts with Lance Gunn and Anthony
Curl (both 89-92).
* Texas forced 4 turnovers for the 2nd straight week. The Longhorn
turnover ratio is plus 7 so far this year.
* The defense is ranked #7 nationally, and #1 in the conference,
averaging a shade under 200 yards allowed a game. Look for these
numbers to be even better next week.
* Texas kicker Dusty Mangum is tied for 10th nationally and is #2
in the Big XII in scoring with 63 points.
* Missouri receiver Justin Gage is #2 in the Big XII with 45 catches
and 518 yards with 3 touchdowns. He will get locked up with Jammer
this weekend.
* The Tigers have found their passing game in Big XII play. The last
3 weeks, qb Kirk Farmer has thrown for 637 yards and 7 touchdowns.
In the 1st 3 games, 3 Missouri quarterbacks combined to throw for
only 399 yards and 3 t.d.'s. Must have been that stout Bowling Green
defense. Don't mess BG, or you, too, will face the Falcon wrath.
* Kicker Brad Hammerich is 8-9 on field goals, missing only from 50+
yards, and 53-54 on P.A.T.'s for his career. Hammerich connected on
the game winner at Oklahoma State in the 3rd overtime 2 weeks ago.
* Linebackers Jamonte Robinson and Sean Doyle might be the best
linebacking duo in the country. Doyle leads the Big XII with 77
tackles, and Robinson averages 14 tackles per game (he is 6th on
the all-time tackles list at Mizzou). Sean, Jamonte, this is
Cedric Benson.

______________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Will somebody get K-State a doctor? More like a mortician. The
Texas A&M Aggies went up to the Little Apple and snuck out with a
win. The Wildcats were stopped on the 5 on 4th and goal, and the
Aggies left with a 31-24 road victory. Nice job, Ags. Bye, bye,
Wildcats.
* Tech went to Lincoln and played well. The Red Raiders lost by
10, but played Nebraska even through 3 ? quarters. OU looked lack
luster in a 33-17 win over Baylor in Norman. You think these 2 were
peeking around the corner at each other?
* Game of the day: Lincoln, NE. Sooners vs. Bug Eaters. This should
be a good show.
*2nd best game of the day: Iowa St. at Texas A&M. The Aggies will
take care of business here...or will they? The Cyclones are 5-1,
only losing to Nebraska. Running back Ennis Haywood had 196 yds
rushing and 3 t.d.'s in the 28-14 win over OSU. Careful, Ags, or
we'll see you whining about this game on ""Sidelines"" next week.


Everyone have a good weekend. Hope to see you at Spanky's in Columbia.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Thanks for getting the OU tickets to me on Saturday.  Do you have any
extras for the Kansas game?  I have Jayhawk relatives coming for the game.
Let me know.  The D and SP look pretty good.  I hope they are holding
something back on O.  We'll see.  Thanks.

tEXas tailgatES talk

The bowls are over, and now the second season begins- recruiting.
Recruiting is it's own entity, with it's own characteristics. For
example, can you think of another instance where grown men
feverishly talk on the Internet about 17-year olds? Well, I mean
one that doesn't include jail time? People will spend several
hundred dollars in the next 4-? weeks on subscriptions to
recruiting sites so they can be the 1st to tell their friends that
Billy Ray Shasta from Cut N Shoot, TX is now considering Texas
and LSU instead of just Miami, or that the Aggies have a
guy who is really 6'3"", 250 instead of 6'6"", 290, and they padded
his stats. It's extraordinary, if you think about it. Adults with
jobs, spouses, kids and such stressing over where a teenager
they've never met from a town they've never been to is thinking
about going to school next fall. Have you heard of anything more
absurd? Let's move on to the bowl games, because I heard Billy
Ray might actually be 6'2"" instead of 6'1"" and could commit today,
so I have to get logged in...

47-43

Wow. What else can you say? Wow. That was one for the ages, folks.
Like I said, Washington can't run, right? One more reason to ignore
me. The Horns fall behind early, rally for the lead, get blown out in
the 2nd and 3rd  quarter only to storm back and win at the buzzer.
Unbelievable.  Saint Major played lights out in the 4th, and that is
good, since he did not in the 1st half. 3 interceptions, 1 for a
touchdown. Yikes. Had Simms done that, some of you would have gone
over the wall after him, noose firmly in hand. Glad you held off on
Major, since he rallied the team.   Quick sidenote: Chris Simms was
NOT laughing at Applewhite on the interception for a touchdown. It
is the job of the freshman quarterback to chart every play called
and what the outcome of that play is. This is harder than it looks,
because the charter does not have the benefit of a replay or
commentary to fall back on, only his eyes. Naturally, these frosh
will sometimes get behind, as was the case that Friday in San Diego.
Matt Nordgren was, at times, 4 to 5 plays behind, and begging for
help from Simms and Chance Mock, who repeatedly laughed him off.
The upperclassmen told the true freshman to tough it out, as they
had to do when it was their turn. The problem was since he was behind,
he was writing during the current play, and spent the entire 1st half
asking the other 2 what just happened. When Applewhite was picked off,
Nordgren ran up to Simms and Mock and asked what had happened, AGAIN,
and they BOTH busted up, as did 1 or 2 other players who were standing
close by, and it got caught on tape. THAT IS ALL. No one on the team
was upset, no coaches, nothing. Simms was not bitter, he was not
slouching, he does not have an attitude problem, he was not unprepared.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Anything else you hear is rubbish.
The game was actually 4 games in one, here's what I mean:
The 1st quarter was all defense, with neither team able to score, as
both missed field goals.  The 2nd quarter was highlighted by 4
turnovers, three by the Longhorns.  Applewhite was picked off 2 times
in 3 possessions, one leading to a field goal and the other returned
36 yards for a touchdown by a guy who had been in 4 plays all season.
13- 0, Huskies. Texas answered with a 43-yard bomb from Major to B.J.
Johnson, and Vasher picked off UDub on the next series, and Applewhite
found Roy Williams on a 25-yard pass for another touchdown. 14-13.
Longhorns. The Huskies answered with a 76-yard drive to take the lead
again. 20-14, Huskies.
Applewhite was picked again as time was running
out in the half, and Washington got another field goal out of it, and
went in at half up by 9, with all of the points coming in the 2nd.
23-14, Huskies.  The 3rd quarter was brutal. As I sat in the stands
I really thought that the Horns had quit, to tell you the truth.
Washington rb Willie Hurst was cutting the defense to shreds, and hey!
Somebody cover that tight end! They seemed flat and listless, and I
was wondering if they really were still carrying that CU game around
with them. The Huskies could do no wrong, scoring 2 t.d.'s on long
drives with relative ease, and the Longhorns matched that with field
goals. Texas was down 36-17 at one point before hitting another field
goal at the end of the 3rd. 36-20, Huskies.  The 4th quarter was maybe
the most exciting and thrilling quarter of Texas football that I can
remember. The team seemed to come out of the fog and wake up. The
offense drove 52 yards and cut the lead to 10 on Matt Trissel's 2-yard
touchdown reception (yes, Matt Trissel), but Texas missed the 2-point
conversion. 36-26, Huskies. The defense needed a spark and a stop,
and they got both with Bam Bam. Derrick Johnson made the tackle on
the ensuing kickoff, stopped the running play up the middle for no
gain on 1st down, broke up a pass on 2nd down, and had the tide turning,
momentum shifting play of the game on 3rd down. DJ came clean on a
blitz and didn't exactly sack the quarterback as much as he ran over
him, planting him on his back about 11 yards behind the line of
scrimmage, and will be forever known to me as The Hit. This happened
in the endzone in front of all of the Texas fans, and it ignited the
crowd. Texas took over at their 46, and Roy Williams bailed out
Applewhite on the next play when he went up between 2 defenders and
snagged an ill-advised pass before getting creamed at the 16. It was
the best catch I've seen Roy make this year.  Big Ivan (who, I think,
realized this game that he is 6-3, 245) got his 1st t.d. of the night.
36-33, Huskies. The Hit seemed to rattle Washington on the next series,
and they looked out of sorts on 1st and 2nd down. On 3rd down, Pickett
tried to force a pass into te Jeramy Stevens, but Cory Redding tipped
it, it bounced off of him and Stevens before DJ came up huge AGAIN and
picked it off at the 25 and took it back to the 9. Applewhite hit
Scaife on 3rd and goal from the 5 for the lead with 6:00 to play. 40-36,
Longhorns. Texas held UDub to 3 and out, and tried to run out the
clock, but no dice. Washington took over with 3:20 to play, and promptly
went right through the Horns, and on 3rd and 1 from the Texas 34,
Willie Hurst went off tackle (and untouched) for a touchdown, much to
the horror of Texas fans, leaving 1:49 to play. 43-40, Huskies. I
really made an effort to watch the bench after that score. They didn't
look down. They were all clapping and jumping around, very upbeat.
You got the impression from the bench that it wasn't a matter of ""if,""
but ""when."" Applewhite hit Johnson for 25 yards up to mid-field on a
beautiful timing play that had Major throwing the ball before B.J.
even broke. 3 plays later, same play, other side.  Applewhite connected
with Johnson for 32 yards to the Husky 5. This time B.J. made an over
the shoulder catch, Willie Mays style. Awesome.
Back to the I-Train to close the deal, as Williams carried on the next
two plays, scoring from the 1 with 38 seconds to play. 47-43, Longhorns.
UW took over near mid-field, but the defense held, and the game was
over. Easy enough, huh?
I have never seen anything like that before. I am glad I was there to
see it person.

Spring Practice/Outlook

Mack Brown has announced spring practice will begin February 26, with
the annual Orange and White game set for March 30. No time has been
set on the game, and these dates are subject to change. The Texas Exes
will have an open house the day of the Spring Game (more than likely),
just like regular game days in the fall. I will be sending another email
the week before that and give you all of the details about the game
(start time, what time we open here, etc...) and a preview of what to
expect and look for. I will also break down the recruiting class,
depth chart, schedule and prognosis for the fall. Here's the Cliff's
Notes version for now:
The outlook for 2002 is pretty good, if you ask me. Do not underestimate
what Winning that game in San Diego will do for the confidence and
psyche of this team. They got over a hump this year (the 10-win hump),
and look for that to do wonders for them. Confidence is everything in
sports. It took Nebraska's Tom Osborne 30 years to win a title, then
he wins 2 in a row, and NU won another in '97 and played for it in
'01. Same thing with Bobby Bowden,  26 + years at FSU with nothing,
and then since the Seminoles won it in '93,  he has won it once more
and played for it 3 more times. Texas hasn't won anything yet, but
they are on the right track. A better comparison would be Virginia Tech.
The Hokies were invisible before 1995, and then they beat Texas in the
Sugar Bowl, and have not looked back. They are a perrenial top 5 team,
and they EXPECT to win every game. Texas is there now.
Texas must replace 8 starters (3 offense, 5 defense), but that sounds
tougher than it is, in my opinion. 3 offensive linemen are gone, but
there is a pool of 17 to choose from. Derrick Dockery and Tillman Holloway
split time at starting guard this year, so both are considered
returning starters.1 will slide to the other side to replace Kirk-Hughes.
Beau Baker got significant time at center before his injury, and can
hardly be considered inexperienced if he wins the job left by Anderson.
The linebackers all graduate, but the leading tackler on the team is
Derrick Johnson, who will start wherever he wants in the linebacking
corps. The soph will be all Big XII next year. Reid Boyd played in
every game at lb last year, and will got the nod at one spot  as well.
Lee Jackson will return from turf toe to fight for the 3rd spot, and
he started for 2 years at ss before his injury. Dakari Pearson will
take the safety spot left by Ahmad Brooks. Dak started at the same
position in 2000. So what you're looking at is filling a void left at
tackle and corner- not easy, but not as uphill as you 1st thought,
right? The biggest challenge next year is the schedule. The Horns go
to UNC, K-State, Nebraska and Tech. A Crouch-less Nebraska, a crippled
K-State, and no freaks on the dl at Carolina (Peppers and Simms).
Again, not easy, but the hill isn't as step as it looks.

News and Notes:
* 11-2. I just like saying it. #5. It like that, too. The Horns finish
in the top for the 1st time since 1983. It's the 1st time since '82
they've done it by winning their way in
(1983, lost the bowl game to drop to 11-1).
* Texas set several school bowl game records:
Most points- 47 (42, Maryland, '78 Sun Bowl)
Total offense- 592 yds (513, Tennessee, '69 Cotton Bowl)
Most passing yards- 473 (368, Pitt, '87 Bluebonnet Bowl)
* The 19-point deficit is the greatest comeback in Texas football
history, beating the previous mark of 17 (OU, 1999).
* Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson set a Texas bowl record by being
the 1st Texas receiving duo to have a 100-yard reception day in
the same game. Roy had 11 catches for 134 yards, and B.J. had 6
for 157, each had a touchdown.
* Washington running back Willie Hurst had 608 yards rushing for
the season. He had 137 yards on 16 carries in the Holiday Bowl,
that's 8.6 yards per carry. Those are Play Station stats.
* Husky te Jeramy Stevens had 9 catches for 109 yards and a touchdown.
I think they all came on the same drive.
* The Longhorns only had 1 penalty in the game.

Around the Conference:
The Big XII went 3-5 in bowl games, here's how they went:

Rose Bowl- Miami 37      Nebraska 14
Yep. Pretty much like I thought. I said Miami would have won the NFC
East by Thanksgiving. In hindsight, I gave to much credit to the rest
of the NFC East.

Fiesta Bowl- Oregon 38      Colorado 16
Colorado's running game vs. Mike Belotti's brain. The brain wins, hand
down.  Goes to show you can beat anybody when they turn the ball over,
right Buffs?

Cotton Bowl- OU 10       Arkansas 3.
Don't make me watch this sort of thing again, Fox. I've seen shuffleboard
at retirement homes more exciting than this. New Land Thief Offensive
Coordinator Chuck Long said he was going to ""open things up."" Belated
Christmas presents don't count, Chuck...

Alamo Bowl- Iowa 19       Texas Tech 16
What? Where's all the offense, Mike? 16 points. There were a total of
7 field goals in the game. Fantastic. Leach is pushing Red Raider qb
Kliff Kingsbury for the Heisman in 2002. I don't anybody ever won it
as a holder, did they?

Insight.com Bowl- Syracuse 26       Kansas St. 3
I told you to look for the tell tale sign for the Wildcats- blowout
win or close loss.  Well, secret option C, blowout loss. They quit
this year, and if they don't regroup quick, '02 will not be pretty.

Independence Bowl- Alabama 14      Iowa St. 13
This went as I thought. I am a big proponent of the Cylcones.
They missed a field goal that would have won it at the end. If
they find a New running back, they could be trouble in 2002.

GalleryFurniture.com Bowl- A&M 28     TCU 9
Yeah. The Aggies found a secondary bad enough to torch, and a team
with an offense worse than their own. It was close until the 3rd,
when the Ags pulled away. Dozens cheered them on.

More News:
* Coach Bob flirted with Florida to get himself a huge raise, Mack
Brown also got a raise, but the 40 Acres can afford it. OU Athletic
Director Joe Castiglione said the Sooners could not go over 2.5 mil
per year, because their department already runs in the red. Well,
they went over, WAY over. Coach Bob got point guard money when OU
came up with 20 mil over 6 years. Now the Sooners have to slash
budgets campus wide and jack up their ticket prices. Why didn't you
ask for a pony, too, Coach Bob? I'm sure basketball coach Kelvin
Sampson will be more than accommodating when his contract is up
next season and he gets nothing. 3.2 a year? Mike Martz, coach of
the soon to be Super Bowl Champion St. Louis Rams, wants a hefty
raise to bring his salary up to 3 million per. Management said NO
WAY. I guess OU knows something St. Louis doesn't.
* Roy Williams of OU went pro. Good. Go terrorize NFL teams and leave
us alone.

That's it. It's been fun this season. I will sign off until March,
when you'll get the preview for the Spring Game, depth chart and
season to come. I will talk to you all in a few weeks.

Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning



We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster

+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers

Subject:	New Football Pool

There is a new Football Pool starting up for us losers who all got knocked out (and the loser Narsimha as well). Let me know what kind of interest there is in this pool. I was thinking of doing 2 pools, another Last Man Standing and this new one, described below:

This Friday, October 26 will be the Bid-Day. Everyone will submit a bid to me by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spend' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will 'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. For example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on the Rams, and $5 on the Broncos. 

We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subtotal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amount toward the Rams.

We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Standing? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are also thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is interested in that as well.

We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.

Brad

Subject:	The lone person from Congress that voted against US show of force 

I just wanted to pass on some information regarding the only person in Congress to vote against the US showing force regarding the terrorist attacks is NY and DC.  Barbara Lee a representative from California's 9th district(Oakland, Berkeley) voted against the resolution.  The final vote was 424-1.  The senate voted 98-0(2 members unable to get to Washington).  Barbara Lee has a history of doing this, she was also the only one who voted in '99 not to respond to the bombing of the US embassies in Africa.  She also was involved in trying to disrupt the confirmation process of President Bush(Al Gore had to tell her to refrain from speaking several times while certifying the electoral college votes).

If you would like to write her or call her to let her know your feelings, the phone number in DC is 202-225-2661 and in Oakland is 510-763-0370.  Her fax numbers are (DC) 202-225-9817 and 510-763-6538(Oakland).  I tried by phone, but every person in her offices' voice mailbox was full(probably full of outraged citizens).  So I faxed her a letter.  I urge you IF you are also offended by her vote, a slap in the face to all Americans and anyone who knew someone who lost their life in this tragedy, to call or fax a letter.  Representative Lee needs to know that she represents all Americans, not just the ones in her district.  Her email address is barbara.lee@mail.house.gov.

I also urge you if you were offended to watch the news, she will be up for reelection in 2004 and look for her opponents, Democrat and Republican.  

Whether you agree or not, you should make your voice heard.

I was thinking that perhaps we should plan to have dinner on Monday evening.
This would be a good opportunity to get acquainted.  Are you available?
Please let me know as we have not made our airline reservations.

I think we will take the 5:30 flight back to Minneapolis.  I assume that we
should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we
need to leave earlier?

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","This is not the regular email, that will come in a day or so,
and it will have all of the regular info, and the tailgate
information for the BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME!!!!!

Tickets
Let's talk about the game for a second. I'm sure you can imagine
the demand for tickets. The Big XII allots 16,500 tickets to be
divided among both schools, or 8,250 each. Cut 10% out of that
for the student draw, and it's down to 7,425. That's 7,425 tickets
for around 70,000 people looking to be in Dallas this weekend.
The 7,425 should raise some when Colorado doesn't sell all of
theirs (they usually don't), so that should push it up to 11,000
or so. That's 11,000 seats for around 40,000 people. These tickets
will be prioritized and dealt out as usual.You should know if you
are one of those who get select tickets or if you do not. If you
do, you should contact the Longhorn Foundation (ticket reservations
started on at 10:00 am on Sunday, November 25 and it ends at 7:00 pm
on Monday, November 26). If you are not one of these people, there
are options: School message boards, ticket vendors/outlets, want ads
in Norman and Lincoln, and most isp's have some sort of on-line
shopping sites where people sell any and everything. Believe me, I
have looked, tickets are EVERYWHERE on the Internet. Start with the
Longhorn links and work your way to the OU and NU sites, the ticket
outlets and on to the buy/sell sites and you will find them.

The Game
This is it folks. It may not have happened exactly like it was
supposed to, but what ever does? It's right there in front of
the Longhorns, and now they need to reach out and grab it. They
need your help. COME TO DALLAS. From the players, the coaches,
the Athletic Department- COME TO DALLAS. When CU came to town in
October, the game was close until the shovel pass. After that,
the crowd took over. Life was unbearable for the Buffalos after
that: they couldn't audible, they had false starts, delay of
games, etc... and they got blown out. That was the crowd. Dallas
is our town, this our state, Texas Stadium is OUR house. The Buffs
are the visitors in OUR HOUSE. Let's make it a Burnt Orange Dallas.
An endless sea of Texas shirts and hook'em horns, and a thundering
stream of noise to let the Buffalos know we mean business down
here in Austin. Let's turn Texas Stadium into the DKR-North.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. Who knows, by the time the game kicks off,
Florida or Miami may have lost, and you could be watching the
Longhorns celebrate Mack Brown's 1st Big XII Championship as the
players carry roses around and the crowd goes crazy in anticipation
of the National Championship game in Pasadena. Get yourself to
Dallas. It's right there.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. DKR-NORTH. OUR HOUSE.

"Today's Excel class canceled","My apologies for canceling today's class.  I am at home sick.  Today's class was only to last 15 mintues or so and provide a brief introduction.
 
If you don't already have your book, please get it today from the box on the floor by my desk.  Read chapter one and do the exercises for Wednesday.
 
The first part of the book is fairly slow reading, but lays some important groundwork.  Also, my recommendation is that for the first couple of chapters, you do both the Excel and Word examples.  The extra practice with Word will help you discover more about VBA that will be useful to you in future Excel work.  After the first couple chapters, the author shifts largely towards Excel.
 
If you set aside a dedicated time to work on the class material, it shouldn't take you that long to complete.  Also, my suggestion for you, to get the most out of the class, is to do your ""homework"" BEFORE the morning of the class.  This gives you time to think about the concepts and go back and review if necessary.  Also, I would encourage you to try and do each of the exercises at the end of the chapters.
 
Let me know if you have questions.
 
Sorry again for missing the class.  This won't be a common practice, I promise!

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Fw: Happy New Year","
 
 


Hope this finds you well this Holiday Season - and here are some  things to remember and keep us sane for 2002!    Darnell
1.  Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age,  weight and height. 
2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you  down. If you really need a grouch, there are probably family members that fill  that need. 
3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts,  gardening, whatever. Just never let the brain idle. 
4. Enjoy the simple  things. When the children are young, if that is all that you can afford. When  they are in college, if that is all that you can afford.  When they are  grown, and you are on retirement, if that is all that you can afford! And if you  can afford grander things...still enjoy the simple things. 
5. Laugh  often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so much that you  can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter. 
6. The tears  happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire  life, is ourselves. 
7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it  is family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your  refuge. 
8. Cherish your health. If it is good, preserve it. If it is  unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get  help.  
9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the  mall, the next county, a foreign country, but not guilt. 
10. Tell the  people you love, that you love them, at every opportunity. 
Remember,  Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that  take our breath away.  May God richly bless you in the coming year.

"The next Excel class","You have been slated for the next Excel/macro class.  Attendees will (most likely) be:
 
    Derek Bailey
    Darron Giron
    Brad Jones
    Kam Keiser
    Errol McLaughlin
    Scott Palmer
 
I anticipate starting the class the first week of October.  This is a little late in the year, with the holidays, to finish by the year end, so we may need January to finish up.  The meeting times will most likely be Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30am to 1pm.
 
The focus of the class will be learning basic programming/algorithm techniques, using Excel and VBA as a platform, with enough real world experiences and examples to keep your interest.  
 
I would encourage you to talk with Phillip Love and Anne Bike to get their feedback on the progress of the class so far (they are about 3 weeks into the class - although the first 2 or 3 sessions are pretty dry) and the time requirements.  There are bi-weekly reading assignments and exercises to complete.  In addition, I will assign a few projects along the way.  The time required should be very manageable unless something out of the ordinary comes up.
 
Consider your availability.  We are all busy, but I believe if you invest the time in the class it will be beneficial to you.  Let me know if something in your schedule will prevent you from devoting the required time so that I can find a replacement for your slot.  
 
I haven't decided whether to purchase your textbooks myself or make everyone responsible for obtaining their own.  I'll let you know when October is getting closer.
 
Let me know if you have questions.  I look forward to going through the class material with you.
 
Greg

Importance:	High

Just got off the phone with Dave Forster.

Currently we are in dispute with Sempra over the terms & interpretations of the verbal & written agreement with Sempra regarding their transactions. They have terminated all agreements & all transactions. The only open 'issue' is the settlement of those transactions.

So, please add CP# 57508, Sempra Energy Trading Corp. to the list previously submitted.

Thank you,
Cyndie

Subject:	RE: Live Deals by Counterparty

We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

I hope everyone is doing okay, and you and your loved ones are safe.
The general feeling and attitude is a return to normalcy, so that's
what we are going to do here.

Off week

Texas was off last week, so there will be no mad scramble to
reschedule a game or any of the other chaos going on in the college
football world.

@ Houston - 8 pm - ESPN 2

Houston was on the way to Georgia to play the Bulldogs
prior to the cancellations.
The Cougars lost their opener to Rice, 21-14, back on September 1, and
have been off since. They gave up 354 yards rushing to the Owls, and
gained only 7 of their own. You might wonder, is Rice good? Well, they
had to stop a two point conversion and a pick off a pass in the last
minute to hold off Duke, 15-13, last week. Duke. At home.

___________________________________________________________________

details:
http://www.texasexes.org/news.php3?id=54

Texas/OU is right around the corner. In the coming weeks I will fill
you in on what will be happening. All of the details are listed in
the following link:
http://www.dallastexasexes.org/

Next week I will also have some more information on the plans for
Mizzou and Oklahoma State.

___________________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
?Last week I said look for Ivan Williams to become the starter at
tailback, and so it is true. The I-Train is averaging 5.7
per carry, so he's easily the best back out there right now.
?The Texas vs. Texas Tech game time has been set for 6:00 p.m. on 9/29,
and Fox Sports Network will carry it. It is as I thought it would be,
since every Texas/Tech game has been at night since 1995.
?Texas picked up it's 13th commitment of the season when Chase Pittman
pledged to Texas. The brother of Cole said, ""My brother and I didn't
agree on everything, although we were best friends? We both wanted to
play for the best coach in the country."" Chase said he knew at his
brother's dedication ceremony in Austin vs. UNC he was coming to Texas,
""Texas is home to me,"" he stated. Welcome home.

Around the Conference:
?Oklahoma starting defensive end Dan Cody has quit the team. Cody
suffers from a severe case of clinical depression, and has left to
take care of himself. Good luck, Dan.
?Former Longhorn recruit and Tennessee Volunteer Lynn McGruder has
found a new home. The Sophomore from Las Vegas was kicked off of the
ther UT football team for a felony charge of possession and intent to
deliver and sell marijuana. Kicked off of the team and facing jail
time, what new school did McGruder find to welcome him in?. That's
right, Oklahoma. Coach Stoops says he hasn't announced whether or not
McGruder will participate in football, but it seems inevitable. I smell
gunfire over c.d.'s and snowball fights that end in teargas and riot
police. Just like the 80's all over again. Welcome back, Sooner.

Talk to you next week. See you in Houston.

                          month's newsletter is dedicated to you (us) shopoholics.
                          Is it possible that a genetic disposition compels us
                          to spend excessively? There is in fact a name for your
                          (our) condition - oniomania. Binge shoppers are categorized
                          with compulsive disorders, as well as with those suffering
                          from anxiety and depression. Medical research hopes
                          to prove that SSRIs, such as Paxil, may provide relief.</font></p>
                        <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">So
                          it seems true. Some of us are wired from birth to spend
                          excessively.</font></p>
                        <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">Implications?
                          Telemarketers could use DNA to determine who not to
                          bother at dinner time. </font></p>
                        <p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">If
                          you seriously can't control spending, get help. Don't
                          be ashamed. Like most mental conditions, treatments
                          exist.</font></p>

                          For the rest of us (you), your brain will release a

                          pleasure knowing you just bought something to enjoy.
                          Steady. And don't let fear from 9-11 prevent deserved

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Le Ugly American II
Mr. Hendrie
Goes South of
the Border


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Miss America, The lovely Kate Harmon, is sporting the swimsuit she chose for this evening's competition.  Miss Afghanistan is sporting the heavy smothering burqua, as chosen (well, required) by the oppressive Taliban regime.M
 iss America is a junior at Portland State University, where she's advancing toward her Master's degree in Bioethics. Miss Afghanistan is forbidden from receiving any education at all, and
cannot read or write.
Miss America has worked as a lab assistant at both the Oregon Health Sciences University and the University of Puget Sound. Miss Afghanistan is, well...
She's absolutely forbidden to work.
Ever.
Miss America's father is an engineer, and her mother works as a teacher. Miss Afghanistan's father was shot by a gang of Taliban militants, but her mother is alive and well, begging for scraps of bread since she cannot work or remarry.
Miss America will be wowing the judges tonight with her rendition of the Puccini Aria, ""O Mio Babbino Caro"". Miss Afghanistan has sadly bowed out of the talent portion of tonight's competition, as she's forbidden from singing (or even listening to) music of any kind.
During her reign as Miss America, Kate's travels have taken her all over America for personal appearances and fund raisers. Miss Afghanistan cannot drive or be out after dark, but she does leave her house occasionally when accompanied by a male family member.
Miss America is an advocate for breast cancer research. Miss Afghanistan hopes she does not get breast cancer, because she cannot be treated by a male doctor, and for all practical purposes has no access to medical treatment of any kind.
As Miss America, Kate is an eligible bachelorette - she can date, marry, or even divorce anyone she chooses. Miss Afghanistan is to be sold into an arranged marriage to a man who already has two wives, but she'll be treated to an execution by stoning if caught in the company of a male outside of her family.
To guard against possible skin cancer, Miss America takes advantage of sunblock when she's enjoying a relaxing day at the beach. To guard against possible skin cancer, Miss Afghanistan is required to paint the windows of her house black, and her pale skin hasn't seen a ray of sunlight in years thanks to that burqua.
Thankfully, Miss America's lovely choice of swimwear fully meets pageant standards -- she'd have otherwise been disqualified. Thankfully, the holes in Miss Afghanistan's facial mesh aren't too large -- she'd have otherwise been flogged.
As Miss America, Kate has the option of bearing as many or as few children as she likes one day, and in a country with one of the world's lowest infant mortality rates. Miss Afghanistan's several pregnancies will more than likely be forced, and one out of four of her children won't see their 5th birthday.
Miss America will likely be quite eloquent tonight - she's majoring in speech communications at PSU. Miss Afghanistan will likely be rather quiet tonight - she's forbidden from speaking in public.
Miss America is 21. Since the life expectancy for an American woman is around 80, she's still a rather young woman. Miss Afghanistan is also 21. But since her life expectancy is around 43, she's already middle-aged.

Subject: RUNM changes


All,
 
The RUNM application will be changed in the near future.  We urge all the users to please test the application by typing the following:
 

runmm - to run it in production 
runmt - to run it in egstest 
runmd - to run it in egsdevel

 
Please note that runm will eventually be replaced by runmm.  If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact me at x57252 or Francis Lim at x35906.
 
Thank you so much for your cooperation and support.
 
Regards,
Karima

Yesterday's list of in the money CP's did not change.  We will forward a list of out of the money CP's shortly.  We will also send IT the list so that they can begin moving them to another book.  There are appox 140 CP's so the move will take some time.

We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.
