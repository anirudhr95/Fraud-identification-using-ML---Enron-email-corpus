Subject: Test of OATI Certificates


On Wednesday, June 19, at 1000 MDT (0900 PDT) we will test the EHV web 
site server's ability to utilize OATI digital certificates.  This will require moving 
to the backup server for about an hour.  While on the backup, access to the 
site will not be available through Tradewave.  After the test, we will switch 
back to Tradewave.

We'd like as many people as possible to participate in this test.  To 
participate, you must have an OATI digital certificate.  If you do not yet have 
an OATI certificate and are ready to get one, please send a message to me 
and I'll let OATI know.  It will take 2-3 days to obtain and install a certificate.

Please let me know today if you plan to participate in the test.  Following the 
test, I'll be requesting information from you as to how successful you were in 
accessing the site.

As I have announced before, after June 30, the access through Tradewave 
will no longer be available.

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve

Subject: OATI Certificates for use in the JTSIN OASIS Nodes - Security
Officer Action


OATI webCARES Security Officer,

As many of you already know, the JTSIN OASIS Systems will begin using X.509
Digital Certificates very soon.  In order to allow the JTSIN OASIS
Administrators to efficiently link a customer's OATI Digital Certificate to
their JTSIN OASIS user account, OATI has implemented infrastructure that
will allow JTSIN OASIS Administrators to programmatically access webCARES
Digital Certificate public key information.  The Digital Certificate public
key information is made public in two formats: through the use of LDAP
technology and as a CSV hourly file dump accessible from the OATI
Certificate Repository website (www.oaticerts.com/repository).

However, due to input from our customers, each Company has to affirmatively
choose to make their Company's public certificate data available through the
LDAP interface and CSV dump.  OATI has specific customer's whose security
policies and procedures require that this data not be made available to the
public.  Therefore, each Company's Security Officer has the ability to make
this data publicly available.  To make your Company's data publicly
available, login to the webCARES System, then under Options, click on User
Settings.  In the User Settings interface, you can check the box to ""Make
Certificate Data Public"" then click on Submit to accept the change.  For all
Company's, the default setting is to make the data non-public.

When a Company choose to make this data available to the public, the
following Certificate information is available: Certificate Common Name,
E-Mail address on Certificate, Certificate Status, Certificate Serial
Number, Certificate Subject, and the Certificate Content in text format
(base 64).  For those Companies that do not want to make this data available
to the public but would like to send the information to a particular
third-party, such as a JTSIN OASIS Administrator, the Security Officer can
use the webCARES Certificate Report feature (available by the end of the
week).  The Certificate Report feature allows the information listed above
to be e-mailed to a designated e-mail address that is entered by the
Security Officer.  The Certificate Report feature can be found under the
Certificate Management page within webCARES.  The report is generated for
all certificates the Security Officer displays on the Certificate Management
screen.  The Certificate Management screen can be configured to display up
to 200 Certificates simultaneously.

If your Company chooses to make its Certificate data public, please make the
change in webCARES soon.  OATI would like to announce this new feature to
the JTSIN OASIS Administrators shortly so they can begin testing with the
data.

Finally, the JTSIN OASIS Administrators are making their final decisions on
what vendor's Certificates to accept.  To make sure your Company's input is
heard, please contact the JTSIN OASIS Administrators for the nodes that your
Company does business with to let them know that your Company would like
them to accept OATI's Digital Certificates.

If anyone has any questions about this new webCARES feature or the
implications of this change, please feel free to contact me for more
information. 

Thank you,

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

Steve

I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Subject:	MID C Question

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve

"City Of Riverside","
I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed

Lisa, 

Are you still having problems with Enpower?  It is essential that every day is scheduled in Enpower, for us to report the correct MTM P&L, which we are doing on a daily basis.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.

"RE: Schedule for April 9th","
Steve is good.  It's his shoulder that  he has problems with.  I saw Cara
at the OATI 1.7 training class in Las Vegas.  She wanted to know who was
doing our scheduling.  I told her you were for now.  Do you guys still
talk.  She said Stacy had left also.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Timelines for Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead Markets


MARKET NOTICE
May 9, 2002
Timelines for Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead Markets
ISO Market Status Distribution:
The ISO Tariff requires the ISO to follow specific timelines for validating
Schedules and closing the Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead Markets.  These markets
must close on time.  The ISO also must adhere to these timelines both to
permit the ISO to complete its congestion management and unit commitment
processes and give timely approval to balanced Schedules and to help ensure
that other control areas have sufficient time to perform their own
validations, check-outs and e-tagging.
To help meet the timelines for the Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead Markets, please
initiate and conduct your own Phase 2 validation before the 10:00 a.m.
deadline for submitting schedules, rather than waiting for the ISO to
perform the validation.  This will help to resolve in advance issues that
could prevent timely Market closing, including identifying and balancing any
unbalanced inter-Scheduling Coordinator trades.  The ISO reminds Scheduling
Coordinators that all Schedules must comply with all of the requirements set
out in the ISO Tariff.  The Tariff does not permit exceptions from
requirements for Schedules submitted close to the closing time for the
markets.
If you have any questions about the Scheduling process or would like
additional training on resolving imbalanced Schedules or other timing
problems, please contact your Account Manager.

MARKET NOTICE

Weekly ISO Operations Conference Calls
ISO Market Participants:
Attention: Operations Personnel
Beginning May 22, the ISO will host a weekly conference with ISO Operations
staff, Scheduling Coordinators, Municipal Utilities, IOUs and other control
areas to review and discuss current operational issues.  
The ISO's objective for these calls is to provide a forum for discussion of
current operational issues.  We will begin the calls with a review of any
current operational issues at the ISO and provide time for feedback from
participants on these issues. Then participants will have an opportunity to
raise operational issues from their viewpoint. 
The calls will be open to anyone, but will likely be most useful to
operations managers, forward market and real time schedulers and other
personnel involved with unit dispatches.  We anticipate that Generators,
Municipal Utilities, IOUs, and other control areas will participate.  
The first call will be held Wednesday May 22 from 11 AM to noon (PST)
Subsequent calls will be held every Tuesday from 1:30 to 2:30 (PST) from May
29 to June 25.  In late June we will evaluate the calls with participants to
determine whether and how best to continue this dialogue, especially during
the summer.
The call in information is: 877-670-4111 Passcode 589314
If you have questions or would like additional information, please contact
Sue Happ at shapp@caiso.com or (916) 608-7059.

"OATI webCARES Appreciation and Feedback","My Sincere Greetings,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your participation in
the roll out of OATI webCARES certificates within your organization. I
enjoyed the contact I had with you and because of your direct involvement
with webCARES your users are properly authenticated to the ETS 1.7 Tagging
system and their data is encrypted and securely transferred.

I would greatly appreciate your constructive feedback on webCARES by taking
a few minutes to respond to the following questions. Your response will help
us plan future enhancements to webCARES products, services and support to
meet your needs.

Note: Please use ""reply"", NOT ""reply all"" when responding to this email.

1.) What improvements, if any, would you recommend to the webCARES web site
to better accommodate your needs?

2.) What improvements, if any, would you recommend to the certificate
delivery process (i.e. exporting and importing of certificates)?

3.) In general, do you believe it is better for company Security Officers or
end users to have control of certificates and corresponding private keys?

4.) Do you believe there is a need for security related classes covering
topics like SSL (https:), encryption, digital signatures, PKI and
troubleshooting certificate related issues? Would you be interested in
attending?

5.) Do you believe there is a need for a monthly security related newsletter
covering topics useful to you in your role as Security Officer, Backup
Security Officer, or Audit Officer? 

    5a) If interested in a security newsletter would you like to receive it
in plain text, rich text, or html format?

6.) Do you want to pay approximately $170/ea for a DST certificates when
your OATI certificates will work on OASIS nodes? 

(if not please contact your OASIS node administrator(s) to let them know you
do NOT want to pay for DST certificates and would like to use your existing
OATI certificates for OASIS access? They are facing an important decision
and feedback from you (their customer) is the only way they can make the
RIGHT decision for your company.)

7.) OATI webCARES certificates are X.509 compliant and thus can potentially
be used to secure any application. Just as OATI secured it's ETS (Tagging)
system, you can use existing webCARES certificates, or create new ones, to
secure your in-house or third party applications. Do you have any interest
in using OATI webCARES certificates to secure your in-house or third party
applications? 

    7a) If yes, would a ""Certificate Integration Toolkit"" or direct
involvement from OATI staff be more useful to you?


Once again thank you for the important role you played in rolling out
certificates within your organization and for your responses to the above
questions. If I can assist with any certificate related questions please do
not hesitate to contact me.



Sincerely,

Unfortunately we have been informed that North Bound Traffic on Naito Parkway will be closed through this weekend.  If you are traveling south you will be able to enter onto Taylor to parking garage.  This will cause some inconvenience to some parkers.  We have been unsuccessful to get the City of Portland to redirect traffic to make easy access for our tenants.

800-684-1336 has been successfully rerouted to 503-464-3720 as of 12 noon today.   I tested and the call routed to Enron at x3720.
 
AT&T is still working to route the 877 number.  As soon as I have a status, I will let everyone know.

All, 
 
The failure to complete this request has put hundreds of millions of dollars at risk for the Enron estate.  The simple fact that I can not give the California ISO the Enron Estates Pre-Sched and Real-Time 1-800 numbers and have them call and get in touch with Enron Estate employees (Not UBS employees) has put the Enron Estate in a position where our Schedule Coordinator certification obligations have been breached and we are no longer compliant with market requirements.
 
We have already received multiple calls from the ISO regarding this issue and they have run out of patients.  They are ready to shut us down.  I am to the point now, if this can not be resolved today.  I need to know who is warring the potential liquidated damages caused by this dropped ball (It sounds Like AT&T), so I can get our Enron Estate Attorneys and Credit Committee engaged in this issue.  
 
What is a normal Service Level which can be expected with a request like this.  Is there a SLA currently in place?
 
Looking for your feedback ASAP.  
 
Thanks - MO

Cindy,
    This is still not resolved.  I am told that Enron Estate is at risk of being de-certified because of this unresolved issue.  Please provide me with immediate status so that I can assure the business unit when this will be done.

All,
    I am not sure who needs to help me fix this but the 800 684 1336 is still going to 3850, NOT 3720 like we need.
 
Also,
    877.464.7779 is still going to 3855, Please Route this to x5070
 
The new 800 number need to go to:
3850 and 3855 respectively,
 
This is now very high priority.
 
 
Thanks

Let me make sure that I am clear on this.
 
1-800-684-1336 needs to be re-directed from 503-464-3850 to 503-464-3720
1-877-464-7779 needs to be re-directed from 503-464-3855 to 503-464-8297
 
Assign new UBS 800 Number to be directed to 503-464-3850
Assign new UBS 800 Number to be directed to 503-464-3855
 
If this is correct, I will ask Cindy Wessels to assist in getting this set up.  Also, we need to confirm the billing address and person responsible for these numbers .  If you could confirm this information, we will get moving on it.  Thanks!

CURRENT SETUP:
I would like to go into the details of the current setup, first.
1-800-684-1336 is the number for Real Time trading and forwards to the following 464-3850.  It then rings to 3852, 3853, 3854, in this specific order (Hunt Group we think).
1-877-464-7779 is the number for Scheduling and forwards to: 3855. It then rings to 3856, 3857, 3818, 3838, 3918, 3938, 3955, in this specific order (Again, we think this is a hunt group).
 
WHAT WE NEED:
Bill and Cara would like to keep the same setup for the new 800 numbers for UBS, if possible. 
The old numbers should be forwarded to the following Enron Estate extensions: 3720 for Real Time (800-684-1336) and 8297 for Scheduling (877-464-7779).
 
Please let me know if you need any additional information.
 
We also must have the estimated time for completing this request.
 
 
Thank you,
 
Victor.

We may be talking about 2 different things.  The numbers we had acquired were for Corey Bentley.  If you need new numbers for Portland, we will still need to request them.  If you could provide the DID number and the old 800 number I can order a new 800 number.  Also, let me know what you want to do with the old 800 number.  Let me know.

We've already made request for numbers, but we still need to provide  the DNIS numbers to WorldCom to let them know where to direct the 800 service.  I don't know if there is an existing number that we will direct these to, or whether we need to create a new number.  I think we are still waiting to hear from David Cummings to confirm where the numbers need to  be directed.  We will let you know as soon as David gets that info.  Thanks.

"Saturday","Hello all-

  Here is the final wrap on Jeffrey's Suprise Birthday party:

  We are going to meet up at the Willamette Athletic Club in the Cafe between 4:00 - 4:15 pm this Saturday.  Elaine at the front desk knows what we are doing; just tell her that you are there for Jeffrey Oh's thing and she will show you where to go.  Jeff and I will be there at about 4:30.  Jeffrey thinks that we are meeting his brother John and one other friend there to go to Who Song.
  If possible, please park closer to Who Song and Larry's; especially if Jeffrey knows what your car looks like. (don't want him to wonder why all his friends are at the athletic club...)  After the cafe, we will head over to Who Song and Larry's (some time around 5ish for those who can't make it earlier).

  Call me if you need anything at all. My cell is 503-703-7685.

  I look forward to seeing you all there!  Thanks for helping me pull this off.
  (If you haven't RSVP'd, please shoot me an email so I have an idea of how many are comming.)

  Thanks again,

  Virginia

     
DATE: 	Saturday May 4, 2002
TIME: 	4:15 p.m. (Jeff and I will be there around 4:30 p.m.) 
PLACE: Willamette Athletic Club,  4949 SW Landing Drive, Portland, 97201,  phone: (503) 225-1068
OTHER:  If you can't make it to the club cafe, please join us after 4:45 or 5:00 pm at Who Song and Larry's across the street.

Map to Willamette Athletic Club: (Call me if you need better details.  It's a little complicated to find the first time)

Grace-

  In regard to proposal #3 in your email:

 Our Scheduler Lisa Gang has volunteered to go thru and see that EnPower matches the Scheduling excel worksheets for December 2001 thru January 2002.  Some changes have been made already by Susan Rance, Gordon Savage, or myself.  Lisa will attempt to hi-light further changes that need to be made to EnPower and we will make those changes here in West Volume Management.  Hopefully this will get EnPower trued up so that we have more confidence that EnPower is correct according to our information.

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve

Do you have an estimate of when we can run the PSCNA for West?  (East ran with information, it was just west that was a problem.)  We need to send out our reports that include that information in the next hour.

"Adjustment to March 2002 Edwards, AFB Schedule","Paul,

We need to make a small change in Edwards, AFB schedule for March 2002
for the Excess hourly schedule (accounting line # 4783).  Since we will
not be having any excess energy to schedule in the month of April 2002
the HE 24  for March 31st will need to be changed from 2 MWs to 0 MWs. 
I would suggest that HE 5 and HE 6 be increased by 1 MW each hour to new
total of  2 MWs each hour.  The reason for doing this is for control
area check out between WAPA in Mountain Standard Time and SCE in Pacific
Standard Time.  We cannot have any excess energy accounted for in April
by SCE in its control area.  

I've attached a revised schedule with the March 31 adjustment described
above.  We need to make this change and provide to SCE no later than COB
Thursday, March 28th.  Let me know if you want to implement the change
in the manner that I've done.  Thanks for your help.

"Information Alert - PLEASE READ","An incident just occurred of which you should be aware.

One of our employees received a call from a person (aka: Jennifer Lewis) claiming to be with Enron's HR department working on a task for Robert Jones.  She requested information about employees, their names, and addresses.  ""Jennifer"" claimed that she had information that needed to be sent to our team per Robert.  She had an old list of employees as she named several employees who are no longer with the company.  She then requested to be faxed a list of our current employees and their addresses.  The fax number given was a Houston number, but with different prefixes than the Enron numbers.

Obviously, this individual was fraudulent and was requesting confidential information.  If any of you receive a call requesting any information about our employees, their addresses, or even asking to confirm if an employee still works at Enron, do not answer their questions.  Please refer these calls to me immediately and I will handle their inquires.  

If you have any questions or need other information, please let me know.  Thank you.

We need to inform you that today (and probably for 5 or 6 days) we need to try and save as much power as possible  -  turning lights off when not needed, close window coverings to stop heat coming in etc.  The reason being , over the weekend some vandalism took place at our Canyon substation and we are working to get it up and running asap, but with temperatures in the 90's and air conditioners being switched on, this could cause some big problems for all businesses downtown.  We appreciate everything you can do to get us through the next few days.  We will keep you updated. 
 
Thank you so much.

Subject: Urgent CAISO Notification - Scheduling Procedure for Daylight
Savings Time Reminder
Importance: High


Market Participants & Schedulers:

Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!! 

The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2001. 

CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition 

The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should prepare schedules
for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI) system for the
upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on 4/7/02.

When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for Trade Date
4/7/02, which is considered a ""Short"" day, SC's should  schedule all 24
hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.

The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data from/to the SI
database for the ""Short"" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will be sent to
settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have only 23
records for this ""Short"" day, Trade Date 4/7/02.

If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade date, please
contact Alek Kandybenko, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-2213.

Playboy seeks 'Women of Enron' 
 
Magazine invites current and former employees to pose 

ASSOCIATED PRESS 
 
HOUSTON, March 25 - Playboy is hoping to entice some of the women who lost
their shirts in the Enron scandal to reveal a little bit more. 

THE MAGAZINE IS putting together a ""Women of Enron"" pictorial and is
inviting employees past and present to send snapshots of themselves in
bikinis if they wish to pose.

       ""This is an opportunity for them to do something fun in the midst of
the turmoil that's going on in their lives. These are women who are out of a
job,"" Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeth Norris said. ""We are offering what you
could view as a part-time job, or what might turn into a new career.""

       Plenty of women at the heart of scandals have appeared on Playboy's
pages, including televangelist mistress Jessica Hahn.   
 
       ""That's rich,"" said Deborah DeFforge, co-chairwoman of the Severed
Enron Employees Coalition. ""We've had so much depressing news or stressful
news, and then to all of a sudden come up with something like that, it's
kind of cute.""

       DeFforge said she would not pose, but added: ""I'm sure there are some
in the younger set who would be perfect.""

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve

I am not sure what you  are asking, but we run this report everyday for the east and west performance books and there is always liquidations.  Today (for 3-26-2002) we are only able to see liquidations for the east book and I am certain there are liquidations for the west book also.

Do you have an estimate of when we can run the PSCNA for West?  (East ran with information, it was just west that was a problem.)  We need to send out our reports that include that information in the next hour.

"Enron / Hanson Permanente Electrical Contract Administration"," 
Greetings:
 
Brad Carson and I had a productive telephone conversation with Caroline Emmert this morning. We agreed to proceed as follows to begin untangling the puzzle:
 
Bouse will forward the Excel file that recaps the payments and kWh's since the start of the Enron supply of electricity, November 2001. Note, that even though we have been far apart on a monthly basis, payments and invoices from November 2001 through February 2002 are very close together -- $2,500,850 compared to $2,500,912.  The Excel file with that information is attached.
 
Caroline has the ISO charges for November, December and January, and she will forward those to me via e-mail today.
 
Lisa Gang is now our Enron scheduler, and Caroline will check with Lisa to ascertain if she is using the daily input information from the Hanson Permanente cement plant. The cement plant has been forwarding information on the day ahead and week ahead usage on a routine during the whole period of Enron delivery. Caroline or Lisa will report to me if that information is being utilized.
 
The monthly billing from Houston (Gwen Williams) has not reflected actual usage at Hanson Permanente.  The invoice amounts from Enron reflect only the base numbers from CY 2000 that were imbedded in the contract for annual balancing.  Caroline will check to see what information Gwen is using for her monthly billing and to see if any of Lisa's or the cement plant's daily scheduling make their way to Gwen in Houston.
 
Hanson Permanente must know who is administrating this contract from the Enron side. By interpolation, we are assuming that the responsible party is Murray O'Neil who is Caroline's manager.  Do we have that right?  Lisa is our scheduler, Caroline is working with the ISO and PG&E true ups, Gwen is issuing Invoices based on Lisa's input and Murray is responsible for both Lisa and Caroline. Does that then mean that Murray is where the buck stops. 
 
We may need to meet in the next 30 days to untangle this puzzle, and it would be beneficial for all parties to understand the organizational structure of each organization.
 
We look forward to working with you!
 
Sincerely.

"FW: Valley Electric Association Dec 01 thru Feb. 02","Lisa,

Please take a look at the scheduling sheets from December and verify when we stopped scheduling Valley Electric.
Please also look at Mark's information below to validate that it matches EPMI's scheduling sheets

I think you should be able to find those schedules on the P:\ drive.  Please respond to everyone on the distribution.

We need this information as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

Subject:	RE: Valley Electric Association Dec 01 thru Feb. 02

Since we're having difficulty tracking down who scheduled VE in December, I propose we invoice based on info. provided by VE's Larry Walls. If we uncover more accurate information internally or from UBS personnel that conflicts with VE's representation, we can always send a revised bill. Any objections?

Subject:	Valley Electric Association Dec 01 thru Feb. 02

Listed below is what I believe needs to be done for Valley Electric Association for the period of Dec. 01 thru Feb. 02.


December 01 - I spoke with Larry Walls of Valley today 3/21/02 and he stated that EPMI serviced them for the period of Dec. 1st thru 6th 960 mws a day at $31.25 = $180,000.  Enpower is showing a balance of 29,760mws for $1,015,560.  I need Enpower to be trued up and given the OK to invoice Valley for the $180,000.
	Virginia I will put this into DMS Friday morning.
    

January 02 - Valley was invoiced $299,984.80 for LD's, deal number 258073.3.  Enpower has an additional amount of $908,920.00.  Enpower needs to be trued-up. 
	 Again Virginia I will put this into DMS Friday morning.

February 02 - I spoke with Ed Baughman and I am billing Virginia today for the amount we are showing in Enpower which is 21,600 mws for $669,600.


To wrap up I need an OK for Dec 01 billing of $180,000 or another amount and Enpower trued-up.  Jan 02 Enpower to be trued-up

Thanks,

Mark Confer

Hi,

I just tried to e-mail you a presentation of instructions for the new e-tag, but it is too big to go thru properly.  Darren just called to ask me if I knew anything about it, and I am printing up 3 copies of the presentation for them.

E-tag 1.7 goes live on the 10th, with a dress rehearsal on Monday.  It is going to be UGLY. Most vendors are not ready, and NERC is railroading the start anyway.  The protocol will be for tags to be made, BUT if there are problems to call or fax the control areas and transmission providers to make sure the schedules get implemented

We will have snacks and cake at the Club and then walk over to Who Song & Larry's together so we all get in together. Who Song's will have drinks, food, dancing, etc.

 Please let me know if you can make it.  

  Thanks,

I plan to get together with Mo next week regarding the California position for next month and hope to tie out positions with counter parties by the end of next week.  I will make sure that Darren is aware of the processes taken, and our positions.

Thanks for the watchful eye!  ;)

That is also the week that we will be setting up for the month of May correct?  Or are we going to do that at the end of next week after we purchase the remainder of peek and off-peak power?

I will be taking the week of April 29th-May 3rd off, and heading to sunny Arizona.  Not quite Hawaii, but I'll work on the tan just as well!
Darren is studying to fill the void left by me, so not to worry, California scheduling will be covered!

I know you are busy. I thought I would email you, so you don't have to call me back later..
 
Rhonda wanted me to let you know that we are checking into the state tax question you had yesterday. She had to call Oregon Tax Commission and she is waiting for them to call her back. She said that it won't go into effect this paycheck, but we should hopefully know something soon. 
 
Also, I wanted to clarify your hours on last week's timesheet. I am coming up with 55 hours instead of 57. 
 
Have a good day!!

Subject: More on OATI Certificates


We are hoping to be able to begin using OATI certificates by the end of this 
week or early next week.  At some point, I will notify you of a default 
password to use for your first login.  You will be expected to replace the 
default with your own password on your first login. However, before we can 
implement, I need updated information from you.    Please reply to this 
message with the following information.

1.	User name

2.	Email address

3.	Phone number

4.	Do you currently have an OATI digital certificate?

5.	I you have an OATI certificate, what is the common name?

6.	If you do not have an OATI certificate, what is the name of your Security 
Officer or security contact?

I am not certain at this point whether we can use Tradewave and OATI 
certificates in parallel.  It seems to be a good possibility, but hasn't yet been 
confirmed.  If we are able to do so, we have until the end of June to complete 
everyone's conversion.  If not, we will have to pick a date certain for the 
change.  Since I will be on the road from June 25-28, the changeover date 
would have to be no later than June 24.

The attached file describes how to obtain a certificate from OATI.

"RE: BPA CURTAILMENT FOR APRIL 22ND","Continued curtailments from BPA.

The curtailments for BPA continued for last week.  I believe we need to have the BPA purchases adjusted accordingly.

 
All curtailments began at 7:00 AM

I have / am requesting cash payments for the purchases to Avista. (I'm already paid through the 27th)

On 5/1/02 Curtailments were 4 contracts #21892 and #21896 from 25 to 22MW and #23273 and #23274 from 50 to 43MW
Lisa will have to tell you the Light load cut on Sunday.

Subject:	BPA CURTAILMENT FOR APRIL 22ND 

On April 21st and April 22nd, Pat Kelley from BPA prescheduling group called and informed me we were curtailed by a total of 12 mw for HE 7-22 for April 22nd at COB.  Accordingly, we purchased 12 mw from Avista to cover our position.  At 1:00 p.m, April 22, Rob called from BPA and informed me they made a mistake with the hours of the curtailment and that it was only supposed to be cut HE 7-20 and not HE 21-22.  Therefore, BPA will not charge 12 mw for 2 hours on April 22nd.

The deal numbers are as follows:  deal#153325(2mw),153327(2mw),305699(4mw) and 305700(4mw)

If you have any questions, please see me.

"RE: City Of Riverside","I just spoke with D. Cavanaugh and he indicated that Riverside has not pulled their Cal-ISO schedule for June 1. Rebecca Grace indicates that Riverside is current on cash payments due Enron. I recommend that we continue delivery until such time as Riverside refuses or they fail to make payment when due. It may make sense to hold off on hedging the July Riverside position (currently planned for next Thursday) to see if they follow through on their threat. In addition, we may want to consider a written response to the vague threats contained in their May 30, 2002 letter.

Subject:	City Of Riverside


I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed

"RE: City Of Riverside","
I want Mo's opinion on this, however, I suspect that booking out of the length June 6-30 with Sempra will yield the best value.

Yes, Riverside is not accepting our schedule.  I will get with Mo when he returns from vacation tomorrow to see if we can set up a new deal with someone else.

At this point in time NO. 

I would think as long as we are sending LD's back to Riverside, we are better off for the first day to just let them go to the imbalance market in Cal.  However, we may want to look farther out in the month and book out with supplier.

Any sense for what level ISO liquidation is running? Are we better off booking out with the supplier? Either way, Riverside will be charged LD's, however, we need to minimize size of the LD's.

Ed,

The liquidation of energy will be at the 10min Dec price.  The ISO will take the Hourly volume position and divide it by 6 then multiplying that by each 10 min price in each hour.

Well, I just spoke with Riverside to let them know we will still be scheduling to uphold our contract, and they again reiterated that they would refuse.  I will know 100% sometime in the next hour or so if they have indeed refused at which time the ISO will call me to confirm.  Yes, the length should liquidate at the ISO clearing price.

As you indicate, we must submit our schedule for June 4 and again June 5 to establish Riverside's intent to continue to refuse delivery. Logistically, at what time will we know with 100% certainty that Riverside is not scheduling? Can you confirm for me that our length will liquidate with the Cal-ISO at the real-time clearing price?

Harlan: We need to get a written response to Riverside this AM.

Riverside called this morning and said they would not submit their schedule to the ISO and will refuse delivery beginning June 4th.  As per the first e-mail from Ed stating that we should still schedule to show their attempt to refuse, that is what I will attempt to do for tomorrow's schedule.

I have scheduled California through June 3rd, and Riverside has not of yet pulled their schedule for any of those days.  Maybe it has something to do with the California energy alert issued yesterday?

I just spoke with D. Cavanaugh and he indicated that Riverside has not pulled their Cal-ISO schedule for June 1. Rebecca Grace indicates that Riverside is current on cash payments due Enron. I recommend that we continue delivery until such time as Riverside refuses or they fail to make payment when due. It may make sense to hold off on hedging the July Riverside position (currently planned for next Thursday) to see if they follow through on their threat. In addition, we may want to consider a written response to the vague threats contained in their May 30, 2002 letter.

Harlan: your opinion?

I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed

I've had a couple questions about being able to use DST certificates to 
access our web site.  The answer is ""no.""  We could program the server to 
accept certificates from different sources, but we would have to install a 
server certificate for each one.  DST wants about $25k to do that.  OATI's is 
next to nothing by comparison.  And OATI client side certificates are free to 
OATI clients, $120/year to nonclients.  So if you want to have access to the 
EHV web site and don't have an OATI digital certificate, you'll need to get 
one.

"Valley Electric","Hi Murray,

Valley Electric was scheduled from December 1st to December 6th.  It appears no power has flowed on any of the deals related to Valley since the 6th of December.  

Susan Rance left a message with Stephany Panus, in Global Contracts, to determine the date and deals included in the contract termination.  We need to know the which deals and time period of theose deals, the $299,984.80 of liquidated damages applies.  Once known, we will adjust Enpower as required.

If you have any questions please call me at 503 464 5065 (work) or 503 449 5463 (cell).

Hope to see you soon in Portland,

Regards,

Gord

"Valid Entergy E-Tag 1.7 Source Sink Registration","E-tag 1.7 Source and Sink Registration

The North-American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) has scheduled the implementation of E-tag 1.7 for April the 10th. One of the many enhancements in E-Tag 1.7 is the attempt to eliminate typographical errors. Therefore, NERC has urged every PSE to register their resources prior to the implementation of  E-Tag 1.7. If you are a pure marketer, with no direct ability to schedule a generator or serve a load, then you are not required to register. However, if you own generation, if you have an obligation to serve, or if you have the direct ability to schedule a resource, then you must register that resource.
Entergy is encouraging our valued customers to register their sources and sinks. When registering your sources and sinks on the NERC website www.tsin.com, please follow the already existent Source/Sink naming convention. This will enable us, and our integrated systems to clearly recognize the desired transaction, and create no confusion when assessing the submitted tag. If you have any questions  please direct them to Alexander Mitreski at (870) 541 - 4535 or amitres@entergy.com. if you have already registered your Source/Sink within our Control Area, please disregard this friendly reminder.

These are the valid source/sink names:

"FW: CAISO Notification - Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time","
	Market Participants:

	Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!! 

	The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2001. 

		CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition 

		The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should
prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI)
system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on
4/7/01.

		When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for
Trade Date 4/7/01, which is considered a ""Short"" day, SC's should  schedule
all 24 hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.

		The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data
from/to the SI database for the ""Short"" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will
be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have
only 23 records for this ""Short"" day, Trade Date 4/7/01.

		If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade
date, please contact Alek Kandybenko, ISO Market Operations, @
(916)351-2213.


		CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition 

		The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in
PST, year around.

		Therefore, the transition to DST should require no
modification to meter data submission.

		However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data
continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.

		If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade
date, please contact  ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431.

	For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.

"FW: City Of Riverside","Who is scheduling Riverside and have they rejected out attempt to schedule delivery?

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Baughman, Edward  
Sent:	Thursday, May 30, 2002 6:25 PM
To:	
Cc:	O'Neil, Murray P.; Elafandi, Mo; Murphy, Harlan; Sharp, Vicki; Erwin, Kenton; Miller, Don (Asset Mktg); Semple, Robert
Subject:	City Of Riverside


I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed

At this point in time NO. 

I would think as long as we are sending LD's back to Riverside, we are better off for the first day to just let them go to the imbalance market in Cal.  However, we may want to look farther out in the month and book out with supplier.

Any sense for what level ISO liquidation is running? Are we better off booking out with the supplier? Either way, Riverside will be charged LD's, however, we need to minimize size of the LD's.

Ed,

The liquidation of energy will be at the 10min Dec price.  The ISO will take the Hourly volume position and divide it by 6 then multiplying that by each 10 min price in each hour.

Well, I just spoke with Riverside to let them know we will still be scheduling to uphold our contract, and they again reiterated that they would refuse.  I will know 100% sometime in the next hour or so if they have indeed refused at which time the ISO will call me to confirm.  Yes, the length should liquidate at the ISO clearing price.

As you indicate, we must submit our schedule for June 4 and again June 5 to establish Riverside's intent to continue to refuse delivery. Logistically, at what time will we know with 100% certainty that Riverside is not scheduling? Can you confirm for me that our length will liquidate with the Cal-ISO at the real-time clearing price?

Riverside called this morning and said they would not submit their schedule to the ISO and will refuse delivery beginning June 4th.  As per the first e-mail from Ed stating that we should still schedule to show their attempt to refuse, that is what I will attempt to do for tomorrow's schedule.

I just spoke with D. Cavanaugh and he indicated that Riverside has not pulled their Cal-ISO schedule for June 1. Rebecca Grace indicates that Riverside is current on cash payments due Enron. I recommend that we continue delivery until such time as Riverside refuses or they fail to make payment when due. It may make sense to hold off on hedging the July Riverside position (currently planned for next Thursday) to see if they follow through on their threat. In addition, we may want to consider a written response to the vague threats contained in their May 30, 2002 letter.

Harlan: your opinion?

I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed

At this point in time NO. 

I would think as long as we are sending LD's back to Riverside, we are better off for the first day to just let them go to the imbalance market in Cal.  However, we may want to look farther out in the month and book out with supplier.

Any sense for what level ISO liquidation is running? Are we better off booking out with the supplier? Either way, Riverside will be charged LD's, however, we need to minimize size of the LD's.

The liquidation of energy will be at the 10min Dec price.  The ISO will take the Hourly volume position and divide it by 6 then multiplying that by each 10 min price in each hour.

Well, I just spoke with Riverside to let them know we will still be scheduling to uphold our contract, and they again reiterated that they would refuse.  I will know 100% sometime in the next hour or so if they have indeed refused at which time the ISO will call me to confirm.  Yes, the length should liquidate at the ISO clearing price.

As you indicate, we must submit our schedule for June 4 and again June 5 to establish Riverside's intent to continue to refuse delivery. Logistically, at what time will we know with 100% certainty that Riverside is not scheduling? Can you confirm for me that our length will liquidate with the Cal-ISO at the real-time clearing price?

Riverside called this morning and said they would not submit their schedule to the ISO and will refuse delivery beginning June 4th.  As per the first e-mail from Ed stating that we should still schedule to show their attempt to refuse, that is what I will attempt to do for tomorrow's schedule.

I just spoke with D. Cavanaugh and he indicated that Riverside has not pulled their Cal-ISO schedule for June 1. Rebecca Grace indicates that Riverside is current on cash payments due Enron. I recommend that we continue delivery until such time as Riverside refuses or they fail to make payment when due. It may make sense to hold off on hedging the July Riverside position (currently planned for next Thursday) to see if they follow through on their threat. In addition, we may want to consider a written response to the vague threats contained in their May 30, 2002 letter.

Harlan: your opinion?

I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed

"The 710 Cap","
The other day I was in the local auto parts store. A blonde lady
comes in and asks for a 710 cap. We all looked at each other and said,
""What's a 710 cap?"" She said, ""You know, it's right on the engine. Mine got 
lost some how and  I need a new one. ""What kind of a car is it on,"" they 
asked?

Now I'm thinking maybe an old Datsun 710, but no, she said it's a
Pontiac.""OK lady, how big is it?"" She makes a circle with her hands
about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. What does it do?,"" we asked. She said, ""I 
don't know, but it's always been there."" We gave her a note pad and asked if 
she could draw a picture of it. So she makes a circle about 3 1/2 inches in 
diameter and in the center she writes 710.

The guys behind the counter are looking at it upside down as she
writes it...and they just fall down behind the counter laughing so hard in 
hysterics.

(Directions ... draw a circle, write 710 in the middle of it, and
turn it around.

"matching Scheduling spreadsheets to EnPower","Grace-

  In regard to proposal #3 in your email:

 Our Scheduler Lisa Gang has volunteered to go thru and see that EnPower matches the Scheduling excel worksheets for December 2001 thru January 2002.  Some changes have been made already by Susan Rance, Gordon Savage, or myself.  Lisa will attempt to hi-light further changes that need to be made to EnPower and we will make those changes here in West Volume Management.  Hopefully this will get EnPower trued up so that we have more confidence that EnPower is correct according to our information.

"FW: Urgent CAISO Notification - Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Reminder","
Market Participants & Schedulers:

Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!! 

The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2001. 

CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition 

The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should prepare schedules
for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI) system for the
upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on 4/7/02.

When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for Trade Date
4/7/02, which is considered a ""Short"" day, SC's should  schedule all 24
hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.

The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data from/to the SI
database for the ""Short"" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will be sent to
settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have only 23
records for this ""Short"" day, Trade Date 4/7/02.

If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade date, please
contact Alek Kandybenko, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-2213.

Hello all-

  Here is the final wrap on Jeffrey's Suprise Birthday party:

  We are going to meet up at the Willamette Athletic Club in the Cafe between 4:00 - 4:15 pm this Saturday.  Elaine at the front desk knows what we are doing; just tell her that you are there for Jeffrey Oh's thing and she will show you where to go.  Jeff and I will be there at about 4:30.  Jeffrey thinks that we are meeting his brother John and one other friend there to go to Who Song.
  If possible, please park closer to Who Song and Larry's; especially if Jeffrey knows what your car looks like. (don't want him to wonder why all his friends are at the athletic club...)  After the cafe, we will head over to Who Song and Larry's (some time around 5ish for those who can't make it earlier).

  Call me if you need anything at all. My cell is 503-703-7685.

  I look forward to seeing you all there!  Thanks for helping me pull this off.
  (If you haven't RSVP'd, please shoot me an email so I have an idea of how many are comming.)

  Thanks again,

  Virginia

     
DATE: 	Saturday May 4, 2002
TIME: 	4:15 p.m. (Jeff and I will be there around 4:30 p.m.) 
PLACE: Willamette Athletic Club,  4949 SW Landing Drive, Portland, 97201,  phone: (503) 225-1068
OTHER:  If you can't make it to the club cafe, please join us after 4:45 or 5:00 pm at Who Song and Larry's across the street.

"JTSIN OASIS Nodes and OATI Certificates Update","OATI webCARES Security Officer,

For those Security Officers whose Companies do not use or access the JTSIN
OASIS Systems, please disregard this e-mail.

As of today, the majority of JTSIN OASIS Administrators across North America
have decided to accept OATI digital certificates.  The following is a
summary of JTSIN Nodes and their decisions regarding OATI digital
certificates:

JTSIN OASIS Node	Accepting OATI Certificates?	
ECAR OASIS	No	
EES OASIS	Still deciding	
MAIN OASIS	Testing w/ OATI Certs, decide soon	
MAPP OASIS	Yes	
MISO OASIS	Yes	
NEPOOL OASIS	Yes	
New Brunswick OASIS (not JTSIN, but requires certs)	Yes	
Northwest OASIS	No	
Rocky Mountain OASIS	Yes	
SWPP OASIS	Yes	
VACAR OASIS	Yes	

Many OATI digital certificate users have contacted OATI regarding the
process for registering their OATI digital certificate in JTSIN Nodes that
will accept OATI certificates.  At this time, I have been told the following
by some entities familiar with the new JTSIN software: There will be a user
interface in the JTSIN software that will allow the Security Officer from a
Company to access the JTSIN system for the purpose of linking the new
digital certificates to the Company's Users in the JTSIN System.  Therefore,
the JTSIN Node Administrators will need to know who the Security Officer or
Officers are from each Company.  Please contact the appropriate JTSIN Node
Administrator(s) to find out more about this process (and verify that this
is the actual process) and when this interface will be available at each
JTSIN Node.

An efficient method for informing JTSIN Node Administrators who your
Company's Security Officers are is to make your Company's public certificate
data available through the OATI LDAP or CSV file dump interfaces (please see
the attachment more information about this feature).  Due to questions and
concerns raised by many of our Security Officers about this process, neither
the LDAP interface or the CSV file dump are accessible to the public.
Access to this data will only be made available to known third-parties in
the industry that have a need to access this data, such as JTSIN OASIS Node
Administrators.

For those Companies that access the NEPOOL JTSIN OASIS Nodes, please choose
to make your Company's certificate data available through the CSV file dump
and LDAP interface as the Node Administrator would like to begin testing the
CSV file dump for identifying Company Security Officers (certificate type
has now been added to this file dump).  For those Companies that do not want
to make this data available, then please communicate to the Node
Administrator who your OATI certificate Security Officer is through other
means.

Finally, OATI will continue to talk with the remaining JTSIN nodes that are
still deciding which certificates to accept as well as those who have
initially said they will not accept OATI certificates.  OATI also urges all
Companies that access those JTSIN Nodes and want to use their OATI
certificates to contact the OASIS Administrators and provide your input on
this subject. 

If anyone has any questions or would like more information about the
subjects covered in this e-mail, please feel free to contact me.

> require this data, such as JTSIN Node Administrators).  
> 
> However, due to input from our customers, each Company has to

> available through the LDAP interface and CSV dump.  OATI has specific
> customer's whose security policies and procedures require that this data
> not be made available to the public.  Therefore, each Company's Security
> Officer has the ability to make this data publicly available.  To make
> your Company's data publicly available, login to the webCARES System, then
> under Options, click on User Settings.  In the User Settings interface,
> you can check the box to ""Make Certificate Data Public"" then click on
> Submit to accept the change.  For all Company's, the default setting is to
> make the data non-public.
> 
> When a Company choose to make this data available, the following
> Certificate information is available: Certificate Common Name, E-Mail
> address on Certificate, Certificate Status, Certificate Serial Number,
> Certificate Subject, and the Certificate Content in text format (base 64).
> For those Companies that do not want to make this data available but would
> like to send the information to a particular third-party, such as a JTSIN
> OASIS Administrator, the Security Officer can use the webCARES Certificate
> Report feature (available by the end of the week).  The Certificate Report
> feature allows the information listed above to be e-mailed to a designated
> e-mail address that is entered by the Security Officer.  The Certificate
> Report feature can be found under the Certificate Management page within
> webCARES.  The report is generated for all certificates the Security
> Officer displays on the Certificate Management screen.  The Certificate
> Management screen can be configured to display up to 200 Certificates
> simultaneously.
> 
> If your Company chooses to make its Certificate data public, please make
> the change in webCARES soon.  OATI would like to announce this new feature
> to the JTSIN OASIS Administrators shortly so they can begin testing with
> the data.
> 
> Finally, the JTSIN OASIS Administrators are making their final decisions
> on what vendor's Certificates to accept.  To make sure your Company's
> input is heard, please contact the JTSIN OASIS Administrators for the
> nodes that your Company does business with to let them know that your
> Company would like them to accept OATI's Digital Certificates.

  In regard to proposal #3 in your email:

 Our Scheduler Lisa Gang has volunteered to go thru and see that EnPower matches the Scheduling excel worksheets for December 2001 thru January 2002.  Some changes have been made already by Susan Rance, Gordon Savage, or myself.  Lisa will attempt to hi-light further changes that need to be made to EnPower and we will make those changes here in West Volume Management.  Hopefully this will get EnPower trued up so that we have more confidence that EnPower is correct according to our information.

Subject:	RE: City Of Riverside

I just spoke with D. Cavanaugh and he indicated that Riverside has not pulled their Cal-ISO schedule for June 1. Rebecca Grace indicates that Riverside is current on cash payments due Enron. I recommend that we continue delivery until such time as Riverside refuses or they fail to make payment when due. It may make sense to hold off on hedging the July Riverside position (currently planned for next Thursday) to see if they follow through on their threat. In addition, we may want to consider a written response to the vague threats contained in their May 30, 2002 letter.

Harlan: your opinion?

I just received notice from COR that they do ""not intend to schedule or pay for any further energy deliveries"" by Enron. The notice is dated May 30. Please let me know the instant Riverside refuses our energy delivery schedule. Since we have purchased the entire month of June, we will be in a position of liquidating that length should Riverside refuse delivery. Once Riverside refuses delivery,  we should plan on attempting to schedule at least once again to demonstrate their intent to continue to refuse delivery. Therefore, we need to discuss strategy before selling Riverside length back into the market or, alternatively, booking out with the energy supplier. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Ed

There were 3 tags that EPE gen did not have, I circled them and filed them under the 15th in the acordian file.  They were amended after EPE's prescheduler went home.  Just wanted to let you know.  It took 45 min. of time to verify with all parties and this time I needed to work on other things since 4c5 was up and down all night and we lost neman 3, copper and 75 coming in from IPC throgh the peak pretty much all at once.  My notes are in the drawer on the right of the rt desk if you need to look at them, it's a yellow pad.  Just wanted to keep you informed.  Call with any questions.

"RE: dude","Right on, works for me, just call me when you get off and I can meet you there, or we can meet at the house, I live a couple blocks from there.
Just take Macadam south all the way out, it turns into Highway 43, and follow it through Lake Oswego.  Once you pass Marylhurst College, you'll see a Burgerville on your left, Buggati's will be just past the Burgerville about a block and 1/2 on the left. It has a green and white sign in front.  If there is no parking available in the front lot, you can park in the Starbuck's and McDonald's lot.

If you want to come to house  - go about a half a block past Buggatti's, you will see McDonald's, that's Walling Way, turn left and follow the road down to Old River Rd., turn left onto Old River and go over 3 speed bumps.  Robin View Drive will be the next street on your right, turn right and we are the third house on the right, 3680 Robin View Dr.  Blue/Green house with white trim and bricks lining the yard.

I am not sure what you  are asking, but we run this report everyday for the east and west performance books and there is always liquidations.  Today (for 3-26-2002) we are only able to see liquidations for the east book and I am certain there are liquidations for the west book also.

Do you have an estimate of when we can run the PSCNA for West?  (East ran with information, it was just west that was a problem.)  We need to send out our reports that include that information in the next hour.

Thanks,

Hello All-

  You are invited to a going away lunch for Grace Rodriguez this Wednesday at Todai restaurant (at Pioneer Place on the 3rd floor).  
If you haven't been to Todai it is a sushi and hot food buffet.  They have sushi, chicken, beef ribs, crab legs, mini lobsters, soups, dessert, etc.  The lunch buffet is $12.95.  The reservation is for Wednesday, May 1 at 11:45 AM.  It is under the name Grace Rodriguez.
  Please RSVP for lunch so I can make sure we have reserved enough seats.

  We will also have a 'farewell' Happy Hour on Tuesday April 30 (that's tomorrow) starting at 4 pm at McCall's right across from the World Trade Center Building #3 for those who can't make lunch.  Let's get out to the waterfront and enjoy the warm weather!

Hope to see you guys there!

I am not sure what you  are asking, but we run this report everyday for the east and west performance books and there is always liquidations.  Today (for 3-26-2002) we are only able to see liquidations for the east book and I am certain there are liquidations for the west book also.

Do you have an estimate of when we can run the PSCNA for West?  (East ran with information, it was just west that was a problem.)  We need to send out our reports that include that information in the next hour.

"Block for Portland team update of California Scheduling and CAPS / ENPower data entry","When: Thursday, April 18, 2002 4:30 PM-6:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where: TBD

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

We all need to have a discussion around current California processes for both the business which is being processed for EPMI as well as the Services business we are providing to our customers.

I would like to walk through each process tomorrow and make sure that everyone understands their roles.

In addition, I feel that everyone needs to understand how to do the other persons job.  I know in some cases this will be harder for some than others.  Trying to understand all of the settlement processes is not something that I expect everyone to pick up. However,  I do expect everyone to know how the scheduling process works and if needed how they can back fill.

Primary area's to cover.

1.	Energy Forecasting
-	Wholesale
i.	Perf. Book only (Active Deals)
-	Retail 
i.	All Active Deals 

2.	Energy Procurement 
-	Wholesale 
-	Retail 

3.	Physical Scheduling DA, HA & RT Responsibilities
-	Basic process 
i.	Receive Daily Forecasts /  (Whole & Retail)
ii.	Create and Submit Aggregated Schedules as SC to ISO
iii.	Retrieve Final ISO schedules and dis-aggregate and check for variances
iv.	Manage variances & RT adjustments (CAPS, EnPower, Estate Sheet)
-	Tools Used
i.	Inputs
ii.	Outputs

4.	Daily Estimation process

5.	Daily Meter Data Submittal

6.	Daily Preliminary Settlement Statement Processing

7.	Daily Dispute Process

8.	Daily Final Settlement Statement Processing

9.	ISO Monthly estimated pre-payment
-	Calculation
-	ESS Settlement prepayment (EPMI Allocation?)

10.	Physical EPMI Settlement with Customers / Books
-	Commodity 
-	Grid Management / Market Transmission Transactions
-	External Customers
i.	ISO
ii.	Hanson
iii.	Pilot Power
-	Internal Customers
i.	EES / PGES
ii.	Book Allocations (Should not be required any longer)

Subject: RE: EHV Web Site


Enron is paid up through June for two people.  The current names on the account are 
Tim Heizenrader and Robert Cooper Richey.  However, unless they left their security 
files with Enron, you will be unable to use the site without registering again with 
Tradewave.  This is not a good time to do this, because Tradewave goes away on 
June 30.  We are moving our website security to OATI about mid-June.  If you want 
continued access to the site, you will have to get an OATI certificate and let me know 
who you want to register.  I'll be charging $200/year per person for administrative 
costs, OATI certificates are free to OATI clients, $120/year for others.  I don't have all 
the details on how to switch over yet, but expect to have them in a couple weeks.  I'll 
put your name on my distribution list, so you will receive instructions when I send 
them to everyone else.
Bill

"Dec Schedule and Position","Lisa, here is a sample of what Jesse Bryson was doing on the monthly
schedule activity, basically just took the applicable Enron monthly schedule
from the contract package and added it to the WAPA hydro monthly schedule, I
have given your Name/number to Lynn Garrett who is our WAPA POC for this,
the Enron allocation (per contract) must be 25% green energy, certifable
with green tags for use at Edwards.

Subject: Dec Schedule and Position


Paul,
Attached is the December model  which shows EAFB approx. 574 MWh short
on Mid-Peak and 1345 MWh long on Off-Peak. I intend to monitor it every
couple days to see how this years load compares to last year and perhaps
we can make an adjustment accordingly. I have also attached the Hydro
schedule I sent to WAPA and SCE. As Elliot mentioned, we will continue
to keep you posted as developments occur here at Enron. 
Regards,
Jesse

"FW: May forecast of EES CA loads","Mo:

Mike Frazier's May load forecast for the EES-CA portfolio comes in under the April forecast. April to May HLH drops from 1250 MW's to 1100 MW's while LLH drops from 900 MW's to 800 MW's. However, please plan on making May purchases today at a level equivalent to 50% of April forecast levels. I have provided a cash forecast to Kim Nelson based on 50% of April load forecast incorporating May forward prices, i.e., Kim is expecting to wire up to $15 million out this afternoon. As discussed before, you and M. Driscoll should plan on purchasing the remainder of EES base HLH and LLH needs next Tuesday (4/23). If May prices hold steady, Kim Nelson should expect to wire out another $10-$11 million on Tuesday (4/23). Just a reminder: please attempt to limit purchases from Avista.

EPMI May purchases: hold off executing purchases until I give the word. We should have a green light from the cash committee shortly.

Thanks.

Subject:	May forecast of EES CA loads

Ed
The attached file includes current model estimates for May 2002 loads in California.  I've included known meter installs and contract rejections for Univ.California, et.al.  There will undoubtedly be changes in both increments and decrements to load as a result of timing changes and a host of factors we just don't know now.  In my opinion, additional losses of UCCSU/LAUSD accounts and those with natural contract expirations slated in May will approximately offset the remaining unscheduled meter installations and missing data, so that the net impact will be be small in either direction.  Hansen Cement is included in the North at a fairly steady volume of about 24 mW (average).

To me, these volumes imply that purchases of about 500 mW in NP-15 and 600 mW in SP-15 on-peak and about 400 mW off-peak in both regions might be pretty safe levels, but I leave that determination to you.  This is just what I can estimate from a number of variables available at this time, including assumed normal weather (a forecast is available for only the beginning of the period).  The overall impact of added meters offset by losses is a reduction from the previous estimate around 7% of total volumes.  If you went ahead with half of last month's purchases today, then you have covered 55-60% of the average load projections shown here.

We will, as always, continue to refine estimates of future load as more information becomes available.  Call me with any questions.

Greetings:
 
The following e-mail was just returned to me. Is Todd Perry is no longer with Enron?  Todd was our most recent contact along with Carolyn Emmert.  Who is our contract now?  Who can respond to the questions noted in my e-mail to Todd - as shown below?
 
         Earl Bouse 

Hanson Permanente Cement

--------------------------------------------------------
 
Dear Todd:
 
Brad Carson and I contacted you by phone last week, but we were only able to access your voice mail. Our voice mail message asked you to contact us as soon as possible.  We need to have a conference or meeting to begin the true up of your invoices with the ISO charges that should be available on our November 2001 bill by this time.
 
In addition, the cement plant is no longer able to access anyone at Enron with our daily power forecast. This morning, we received this report from the Permanente cement plant:
 
 Over the last two weeks, each of the three Enron recipients of the our daily power forecast have been dropping off line.  What I mean is that the E-mails return to me as undelivered.  Chris Foster (503-464-3822) no longer works for Enron, but he was kind enough to inform me that the other two recipients, Lester Rawson and Serena Bishop, also longer work for Enron.  Foster related that as far as he knows, the program was cancelled and we are buying or selling power based solely on our historical usage with no forecasting at all. 
 
Todd, please call me.  We must determine who the contact is going to be for the cement plant and how we are going to resolve (true up) the billing.
 
Sincerely, 

         Earl Bouse

Subject:	RE: MID:  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

I'm trying to reconcile your e-mail with two statements made in a declaration filed by Scott Van Vuren of MID in support of a motion filed with the bankruptcy court to accept or reject their contracts:

          12.	On or about January 11, 2002, Jim Burkle, an Account Representative for EPMI contracted me and stated his belief that the MID Master Agreement and related Transactions had terminated.  In ensuing conversations, Mr. Burkle reiterated his belief, and discussed the calculation of the resultant Termination Payment under the MID Master Agreement.

          13.	Shortly thereafter, the EPMI operations personnel contacted the MID operations personnel and verbally informed them that EPMI would cease delivering power under the MID Firm Power Agreement on February 1, 2002.  On February 1, 2002, EPMI stopped delivering power under the MID Firm Power Agreement.  Based on existing damages and the estimated price of energy through the month of June 2002, MID's damages through June 2002 will likely be in excess of $270,000.

MID claims the Master Agreement covers 4 transactions (in fact, I think it covers 8 - the four they exclude, when taken together, appear out-of-the- money to EPMI).  The Firm Power Agreement covers one transaction, a 7 MW @ $19.30, 7x24 sale by EPMI to MID at COB.  Attached is a summary of the deals we have with MID.

Some understanding of what power actually flowed is needed to reconcile our AP/AR reports with their statements and to determine what, if any, damages MID might be entitled to.  Can you validate or definatively dismiss their statement of facts?

Modesto was terminated, per the master letter log, on 12/2/01.  I've asked settlements to see if they are current on payments, but we have not been dealing with them post bankruptcy on an operational front.

I vaguely remember EPMI scheduling to Modesto for a brief period even though the physical contract was out of the money. The rational for this action was based on moving BPA length that otherwise would have been difficult to move.

Mo: Please check with the schedulers to determine how much power EPMI scheduled with Modesto IRR and for how long.

Thanks.

Subject:	MID:  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

I spoke with Marshall turner at Weil this morning.  We need to decide whether to oppose MID's motion for order determining that contracts have been terminated.  We have two agreements with MID, and apparently MID would like them terminated as forward contracts not subject to the automatic stay.  In order to know whether we should be developing a legal strategy opposing MID's motion (which might be an uphill struggle), here is the factual info we need:

1.  Are either or both of the contracts in the money?  What is the MTM of each one?

2.  When did we stop serving under each of the contracts?  Are we still serving either of them?

3.  Has MID paid for all the power we delivered?

4.  Are there any other MID issues we should be aware of (unresolved disputes, additional confirms for other deals, etc.)?

Thank you in advance for gathering those answers, and please let me know how I can help.  I haven't yet seen the contracts and confirms, but I understand that you are attempting to gather them from our back office staff.  I have a sense that we may end up supporting MID's motion, but we won't know for sure until we get the above answers.  MID admits it owes us money under one of the contracts, but also wants to set off amounts allegedly due by EPMI under the other one.  If the net is a payment to us, I would expect that we'd support a termination, although we'd likely oppose the setoff claim; we might attempt to sever treatment of the two contracts and reject the one out of the money, if we could.

"OATI Certificates for use in the JTSIN OASIS Nodes - Security Officer Action","OATI webCARES Security Officer,

As many of you already know, the JTSIN OASIS Systems will begin using X.509
Digital Certificates very soon.  In order to allow the JTSIN OASIS
Administrators to efficiently link a customer's OATI Digital Certificate to
their JTSIN OASIS user account, OATI has implemented infrastructure that
will allow JTSIN OASIS Administrators to programmatically access webCARES
Digital Certificate public key information.  The Digital Certificate public
key information is made public in two formats: through the use of LDAP
technology and as a CSV hourly file dump accessible from the OATI
Certificate Repository website (www.oaticerts.com/repository).

However, due to input from our customers, each Company has to affirmatively
choose to make their Company's public certificate data available through the
LDAP interface and CSV dump.  OATI has specific customer's whose security
policies and procedures require that this data not be made available to the
public.  Therefore, each Company's Security Officer has the ability to make
this data publicly available.  To make your Company's data publicly
available, login to the webCARES System, then under Options, click on User
Settings.  In the User Settings interface, you can check the box to ""Make
Certificate Data Public"" then click on Submit to accept the change.  For all
Company's, the default setting is to make the data non-public.

When a Company choose to make this data available to the public, the
following Certificate information is available: Certificate Common Name,
E-Mail address on Certificate, Certificate Status, Certificate Serial
Number, Certificate Subject, and the Certificate Content in text format
(base 64).  For those Companies that do not want to make this data available
to the public but would like to send the information to a particular
third-party, such as a JTSIN OASIS Administrator, the Security Officer can
use the webCARES Certificate Report feature (available by the end of the
week).  The Certificate Report feature allows the information listed above
to be e-mailed to a designated e-mail address that is entered by the
Security Officer.  The Certificate Report feature can be found under the
Certificate Management page within webCARES.  The report is generated for
all certificates the Security Officer displays on the Certificate Management
screen.  The Certificate Management screen can be configured to display up
to 200 Certificates simultaneously.

If your Company chooses to make its Certificate data public, please make the
change in webCARES soon.  OATI would like to announce this new feature to
the JTSIN OASIS Administrators shortly so they can begin testing with the
data.

Finally, the JTSIN OASIS Administrators are making their final decisions on
what vendor's Certificates to accept.  To make sure your Company's input is
heard, please contact the JTSIN OASIS Administrators for the nodes that your
Company does business with to let them know that your Company would like
them to accept OATI's Digital Certificates.

If anyone has any questions about this new webCARES feature or the
implications of this change, please feel free to contact me for more
information.

"MID C Question","Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve

"April Purchases","
We need to be prepared to purchase energy to cover West power April shorts. I propose we make purchases Tuesday AM. Are we comfortable that we know exactly what MWhrs must be covered by location? The issue, as always, is that money cannot be wired to the counterparties until detailed cash requests, including back-up (As prepared by Mo for March) is presented to the cash committee.

Mike/Matt: Are we jeopardizing our ability to effectively cover April if we wait to purchase on Wednesday AM (since Mo is out today)? I know AEP was concerned about our late buying for March. Please advise.

Thanks.

"Mike & Jackie's flowers . .","To all,

I just ordered flowers to be sent to Mike and Jackie Purcell who just recently had a miscarriage.  
If you would like to donate to the expense of $63.87 feel free to do so.
The card on the flowers says ""Thinking of you, from all of us at the Enron Estate.""

Thanks,
Susan
