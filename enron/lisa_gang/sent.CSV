$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve

Mark is the one that is taking care of that CP and he is not in today.Sabrina Minnis is original coordinator and I asked if she had copies of the information for Hafslund and she replied that she gave it information to Mark Confer.  I'll leave him a note letting him know what you need. The Hafslund issue that I was working with is dealing with the month of Jan 2001. Let me know if I could be of any more assistance to you.

NCPA, scheduling coordinator for City of Oakland called 3/30 and 3/31 regarding the 5MW flat schedule we sold to them at NP15.  They informed me that the subject contract is terminated and therefore will not submit it through ISO.  I called Mo and Murray and they informed that the contract is still valid and therefore keep the schedule in.  ISO called 3/31 A.M and informed me NCPA and Enron will have to settle it.  Murray called NCPA and they agreed to put in the 5MW schedule for April 1.  For April 2nd and through the end of the month, we will not submit the 5MW until we hear different from legal.

Right on, works for me, just call me when you get off and I can meet you there, or we can meet at the house, I live a couple blocks from there.
Just take Macadam south all the way out, it turns into Highway 43, and follow it through Lake Oswego.  Once you pass Marylhurst College, you'll see a Burgerville on your left, Buggati's will be just past the Burgerville about a block and 1/2 on the left. It has a green and white sign in front.  If there is no parking available in the front lot, you can park in the Starbuck's and McDonald's lot.

If you want to come to house  - go about a half a block past Buggatti's, you will see McDonald's, that's Walling Way, turn left and follow the road down to Old River Rd., turn left onto Old River and go over 3 speed bumps.  Robin View Drive will be the next street on your right, turn right and we are the third house on the right, 3680 Robin View Dr.  Blue/Green house with white trim and bricks lining the yard.

Maybe God wants us to meet a
few wrong people before meeting
the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know
how to be grateful for that gift.

When the door of happiness closes,
another opens, but often times we look
so long at the closed door that we don't
see the one which has been opened for us.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/door_carpet_md_wht.gif>

  <http://www2.flowgo.com/images/bt/trans.gif?page_id=10005>

The best kind of friend is the kind you
can sit on a porch and swing with,
never say a word, and then walk away
feeling like it was the best
conversation you've ever had.

It's true that we don't know what we've
got until we lose it, but it's also true
that we don't know what we've been
missing until it arrives.

Giving someone all your love is never an
assurance that they'll love you back.
Don't expect love in return; just wait
for it to grow in their heart.
But if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>            <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>

It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone,
but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.

Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.
Find the one that makes your heart smile.

There are moments in life when you miss someone
so much that you just want to pick them from
your dreams and hug them for real.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/hug.gif>

Dream what you want to dream; go where you
want to go; be what you want to be,
because you have only one life and one
chance to do all the things you want to do.

Always put yourself in others' shoes.
If you feel that it hurts you,
it probably hurts the other person too.

The happiest of people don't necessarily
have the best of everything;
they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

The brightest future will always be based
on a forgotten past, you can't go on well
in life until you let go of your past
failures and heartaches.

When you were born, you were crying and
everyone around you was smiling.
Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one who is smiling and
everyone around you is crying.

Subject: FW: CAISO Notification - Scheduling Procedure for Daylight
Savings Time



	Market Participants:

	Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!! 

	The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2001. 

		CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition 

		The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should
prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI)
system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on
4/7/01.

		When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for
Trade Date 4/7/01, which is considered a ""Short"" day, SC's should  schedule
all 24 hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.

		The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data
from/to the SI database for the ""Short"" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will
be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have
only 23 records for this ""Short"" day, Trade Date 4/7/01.

		If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade
date, please contact Alek Kandybenko, ISO Market Operations, @
(916)351-2213.


		CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition 

		The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in
PST, year around.

		Therefore, the transition to DST should require no
modification to meter data submission.

		However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data
continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.

		If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade
date, please contact  ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431.

	For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.

Virgina, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe BPA has special rules when energy is curtailed.  Instead of us charging them with liquidated damages, BPA will not bill for the hours curtailed.  I track and record the cuts by modifying the deal in deal scheduling so that settlement is aware of the cuts.

We were cut 40 MW today by BPA for peak hours on 6/18 at COB on enpower deal number 305699. Lisa purchased replacement power from Avista at $30. Enpower 897712

We presold power to Avista at $33.50 for the month and are now buying it back from them at $30 to book out.  Of course, BPA should not charge us for the 27.25 supply price under their contract.

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

"RE: MID C Question","$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Subject:	RE: MID C Question

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

schedule activity, basically just took the applicable Enron monthly schedule
from the contract package and added it to the WAPA hydro monthly schedule, I
have given your Name/number to Lynn Garrett who is our WAPA POC for this,
the Enron allocation (per contract) must be 25% green energy, certifable
with green tags for use at Edwards.

Paul,
Attached is the December model  which shows EAFB approx. 574 MWh short
on Mid-Peak and 1345 MWh long on Off-Peak. I intend to monitor it every
couple days to see how this years load compares to last year and perhaps
we can make an adjustment accordingly. I have also attached the Hydro
schedule I sent to WAPA and SCE. As Elliot mentioned, we will continue
to keep you posted as developments occur here at Enron.

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Steve

Lisa,

Paul asked that I relay the contractual information for developing the

Contract Rate of Delivery for April = 18,285 kW
Firm Electric Service = 8,809,000 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4782)
Non-Firm Interuptable Service = 0 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4783)
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service = 4,571 kW
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service Energy = 1,389,660 kWh

I've attached a Firm Electric Service Schedule that would meet the
above contractual requirements for your review.

Please contact me at (602) 352-2678 or lgarrett@wapa.gov if you have
questions.  Once you have the hourly Parker-Davis Firm Electric Service

Dear Todd:
 
Brad Carson and I contacted you by phone last week, but we were only able to access your voice mail. Our voice mail message asked you to contact us as soon as possible.  We need to have a conference or meeting to begin the true up of your invoices with the ISO charges that should be available on our November 2001 bill by this time.
 
In addition, the cement plant is no longer able to access anyone at Enron with our daily power forecast. This morning, we received this report from the Permanente cement plant:
 
 Over the last two weeks, each of the three Enron recipients of the our daily power forecast have been dropping off line.  What I mean is that the E-mails return to me as undelivered.  Chris Foster (503-464-3822) no longer works for Enron, but he was kind enough to inform me that the other two recipients, Lester Rawson and Serena Bishop, also longer work for Enron.  Foster related that as far as he knows, the program was cancelled and we are buying or selling power based solely on our historical usage with no forecasting at all. 
 
Todd, please call me.  We must determine who the contact is going to be for the cement plant and how we are going to resolve (true up) the billing.
 
Sincerely, 

         Earl Bouse

Lisa:

Houston found another small dispute for Dec. 2001 with BPA.  

Please see the attached.  

In sum, based on BPA's figures, it looks like we doubled up by adding numbers from the 25th to numbers for the 26th (hence, doubling the 26th)
According to them:

12/26
Deal 381345 = 600 MW total (not 1200) 
Deal 380414.1 = 200 MW total (not 400)

Please check the scheduling sheets and let me know if you agree.

Thanks!  Jenny

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

Subject: Adjustment to March 2002 Edwards, AFB Schedule


Paul,

We need to make a small change in Edwards, AFB schedule for March 2002
for the Excess hourly schedule (accounting line # 4783).  Since we will
not be having any excess energy to schedule in the month of April 2002
the HE 24  for March 31st will need to be changed from 2 MWs to 0 MWs. 
I would suggest that HE 5 and HE 6 be increased by 1 MW each hour to new
total of  2 MWs each hour.  The reason for doing this is for control
area check out between WAPA in Mountain Standard Time and SCE in Pacific
Standard Time.  We cannot have any excess energy accounted for in April
by SCE in its control area.  

I've attached a revised schedule with the March 31 adjustment described
above.  We need to make this change and provide to SCE no later than COB
Thursday, March 28th.  Let me know if you want to implement the change
in the manner that I've done.  Thanks for your help.

At 1:00 p.m, April 22, Rob called from BPA and informed me they made a mistake with the hours of the curtailment and that it was only supposed to be cut HE 7-20 and not HE 21-22.

Portland Employees-

At this time Enron Portland has 5 parking spots allocated based on floor space and number of employees.  As UBS employees leave we do not automatically have the ability to take over their spots.  However, in renegotiating our lease with PGE we will address the possibility of taking over more that the 5 allocated spots.  We will keep you updated as to the progress of this.  For now, Khymberly Booth is checking into the availability of 1 or more of our spots and will offer any available spots to Portland employees based on Portland office seniority.  We will contact you individually if a spot becomes available.  If you have any questions please contact Kathy Sheppard or Khymberly Booth.

Hi Rhonda,

 I know you are not the one who is working on this but I forgot who was....Can you tell me who and forward this email to that person.  I'm a little concerned about my State Income Tax deduction.  I have not yet seen any withdraws from my check and I know State of Oregon will charge you penalties if you exceed a certain amount per quarter.  Please look into this as soon as you can.  Thank You.

Maybe God wants us to meet a
few wrong people before meeting
the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know
how to be grateful for that gift.

When the door of happiness closes,
another opens, but often times we look
so long at the closed door that we don't
see the one which has been opened for us.

The best kind of friend is the kind you
can sit on a porch and swing with,
never say a word, and then walk away
feeling like it was the best
conversation you've ever had.

It's true that we don't know what we've
got until we lose it, but it's also true
that we don't know what we've been
missing until it arrives.

Giving someone all your love is never an
assurance that they'll love you back.
Don't expect love in return; just wait
for it to grow in their heart.
But if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>            <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>

It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone,
but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.

Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.
Find the one that makes your heart smile.

There are moments in life when you miss someone
so much that you just want to pick them from
your dreams and hug them for real.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/hug.gif>

Dream what you want to dream; go where you
want to go; be what you want to be,
because you have only one life and one
chance to do all the things you want to do.

Always put yourself in others' shoes.
If you feel that it hurts you,
it probably hurts the other person too.

The happiest of people don't necessarily
have the best of everything;
they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

The brightest future will always be based
on a forgotten past, you can't go on well
in life until you let go of your past
failures and heartaches.

When you were born, you were crying and
everyone around you was smiling.
Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one who is smiling and
everyone around you is crying.
