"BPA Dec. 01, DMS #12593","Elsie:

Sorry, in looking over this again with Lisa, we want to be sure that we understand the request correctly.  

See attached for my understanding of what you are requesting and please confirm.

I looked at this from the perspective of each entire deal.  For each, I took the total price and volume of the deal and subtracted/added the MWs you specified and then calculated the revised value of each deal.  

Is this a correct understanding of the changes needed and their impact?

Thanks, Jenny

Thanks for the welcome!

Already I have a quick question - in the attached spreadsheet, the disputed MW columns seem to add up to 12600 and 4450.  In reading the DMS, I would expect them to add up to 14600 and 5600 (or 12600 and 3600, if I only include the referrenced deal, #12593). Am I missing something?

Maybe God wants us to meet a
few wrong people before meeting
the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know
how to be grateful for that gift.

When the door of happiness closes,
another opens, but often times we look
so long at the closed door that we don't
see the one which has been opened for us.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/door_carpet_md_wht.gif>

  <http://www2.flowgo.com/images/bt/trans.gif?page_id=10005>

The best kind of friend is the kind you
can sit on a porch and swing with,
never say a word, and then walk away
feeling like it was the best
conversation you've ever had.

It's true that we don't know what we've
got until we lose it, but it's also true
that we don't know what we've been
missing until it arrives.

Giving someone all your love is never an
assurance that they'll love you back.
Don't expect love in return; just wait
for it to grow in their heart.
But if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>            <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>

It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone,
but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.

Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.
Find the one that makes your heart smile.

There are moments in life when you miss someone
so much that you just want to pick them from
your dreams and hug them for real.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/hug.gif>

Dream what you want to dream; go where you
want to go; be what you want to be,
because you have only one life and one
chance to do all the things you want to do.

Always put yourself in others' shoes.
If you feel that it hurts you,
it probably hurts the other person too.

The happiest of people don't necessarily
have the best of everything;
they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

The brightest future will always be based
on a forgotten past, you can't go on well
in life until you let go of your past
failures and heartaches.

When you were born, you were crying and
everyone around you was smiling.
Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one who is smiling and
everyone around you is crying.

On Wednesday, June 19, at 1000 MDT (0900 PDT) we will test the EHV web 
site server's ability to utilize OATI digital certificates.  This will require moving 
to the backup server for about an hour.  While on the backup, access to the 
site will not be available through Tradewave.  After the test, we will switch 
back to Tradewave.

We'd like as many people as possible to participate in this test.  To 
participate, you must have an OATI digital certificate.  If you do not yet have 
an OATI certificate and are ready to get one, please send a message to me 
and I'll let OATI know.  It will take 2-3 days to obtain and install a certificate.

Please let me know today if you plan to participate in the test.  Following the 
test, I'll be requesting information from you as to how successful you were in 
accessing the site.

As I have announced before, after June 30, the access through Tradewave 
will no longer be available.

Jennifer,
Yes, I do believe you have the correct understanding.  The ttls you have tie to the dms impact. Let me know if you have any questions.

Elsie:

Sorry, in looking over this again with Lisa, we want to be sure that we understand the request correctly.  

See attached for my understanding of what you are requesting and please confirm.

I looked at this from the perspective of each entire deal.  For each, I took the total price and volume of the deal and subtracted/added the MWs you specified and then calculated the revised value of each deal.  

Is this a correct understanding of the changes needed and their impact?

Thanks, Jenny

Jennifer,,,,,I updated the dms....in the comment section this is for 2 deals...the difference between enpwer mw and revised mw will be 8150 mw (12600mw revised to 4450mw)...the spreadsheet is the detail for the changes needed and not totals for the deals.

Thanks for the welcome!

Already I have a quick question - in the attached spreadsheet, the disputed MW columns seem to add up to 12600 and 4450.  In reading the DMS, I would expect them to add up to 14600 and 5600 (or 12600 and 3600, if I only include the referrenced deal, #12593). Am I missing something?

Please see the attached.  

In sum, based on BPA's figures, it looks like we doubled up by adding numbers from the 25th to numbers for the 26th (hence, doubling the 26th)
According to them:

12/26
Deal 381345 = 600 MW total (not 1200) 
Deal 380414.1 = 200 MW total (not 400)

Please check the scheduling sheets and let me know if you agree.

Virgina, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe BPA has special rules when energy is curtailed.  Instead of us charging them with liquidated damages, BPA will not bill for the hours curtailed.  I track and record the cuts by modifying the deal in deal scheduling so that settlement is aware of the cuts.

We were cut 40 MW today by BPA for peak hours on 6/18 at COB on enpower deal number 305699. Lisa purchased replacement power from Avista at $30. Enpower 897712

We presold power to Avista at $33.50 for the month and are now buying it back from them at $30 to book out.  Of course, BPA should not charge us for the 27.25 supply price under their contract.

I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

I looked at this from the perspective of each entire deal.  For each, I took the total price and volume of the deal and subtracted/added the MWs you specified and then calculated the revised value of each deal.

Virgina, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe BPA has special rules when energy is curtailed.  Instead of us charging them with liquidated damages, BPA will not bill for the hours curtailed.  I track and record the cuts by modifying the deal in deal scheduling so that settlement is aware of the cuts.

We were cut 40 MW today by BPA for peak hours on 6/18 at COB on enpower deal number 305699. Lisa purchased replacement power from Avista at $30. Enpower 897712

We presold power to Avista at $33.50 for the month and are now buying it back from them at $30 to book out.  Of course, BPA should not charge us for the 27.25 supply price under their contract.

Subject: More on OATI Certificates


We are hoping to be able to begin using OATI certificates by the end of this 
week or early next week.  At some point, I will notify you of a default 
password to use for your first login.  You will be expected to replace the 
default with your own password on your first login. However, before we can 
implement, I need updated information from you.    Please reply to this 
message with the following information.

1.	User name

2.	Email address

3.	Phone number

4.	Do you currently have an OATI digital certificate?

5.	I you have an OATI certificate, what is the common name?

6.	If you do not have an OATI certificate, what is the name of your Security 
Officer or security contact?

I am not certain at this point whether we can use Tradewave and OATI 
certificates in parallel.  It seems to be a good possibility, but hasn't yet been 
confirmed.  If we are able to do so, we have until the end of June to complete 
everyone's conversion.  If not, we will have to pick a date certain for the 
change.  Since I will be on the road from June 25-28, the changeover date 
would have to be no later than June 24.

The attached file describes how to obtain a certificate from OATI.
