"RE: Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy","Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Best,
Jeff

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

Message Points on Current Status of Company

A.	Our core businesses are strong, performing well and customers continue to demonstrate their confidence in us.
B.	EnronOnline experienced above average levels for number of transactions
	Wednesday (10/24/01), Enron recorded more than 8000 transactions with 1399 external users for a gross notional value of approximately $4 billion
	We continue to be the market maker of choice in wholesale gas and power
C.	Our gas and power numbers indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, nor reducing transaction levels with us.  
Indeed, customers are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios for the upcoming winter and protect themselves from price volatility.



Media Q & A

What did you receive from the SEC?
Enron received a letter and subsequent phone call requesting that we voluntarily provide information regarding certain related party transactions.

When did you receive the request from the SEC?
We received a fax on Wednesday afternoon, October 19, 2001, and a phone call on Thursday afternoon, October 20, 2001.

What did you do about the request from the SEC when you received it?
An informal inquiry is not a material event; however, because of the high visibility of Enron and the recent public spotlight on the transaction, we convened a meeting of our Board as soon as possible.  We recommended that we announce the SEC request; the Board agreed, and we made the release prior to the market opening on Monday, October 22, 2001.

What are you going to do about the request?
We are cooperating fully with the SEC and see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us.



These message points will be constantly changing and we will update you as the changes occur.

"Hi","Rick:

Its been a long time and things are coming to their logical end. I thought I would briefly update you on developments here. We are all eagerly awaiting the 19th of November when in all likelihood we would be serving the Termination  Notice (TN) to the state government. Thereafter the assets would be transfered to the State Utility and we would want to proceed to London for international arbitration. There may be a few hurdles in the sense that we already have some cases lined against us in various Indian courts. Its not clear if we can proceed as smoothly as the way I have described in the initial lines.

We had an all employee meeting , a few days back, and Wade informed us of the recent developments. Post that he did indicate in no uncertain terms the future of all the employees here. Give and take I expect that our services here would be required at max till the time the TN is served, post that our contracts could be severed. Some relocations and some severances have already started and its a matter of time before my turn arrives.

I would like to explore possible future employment opportunities under you, in Houston. It would give me immense pleasure if I could in any way continue to contribute to the activities of the division. 

Any advice from you would boost my morale

Warm Regards
Ban

However, we have learned today that the SEC is extremely sensitive about us using their inquiry as a ""shield"" to not answer certain questions -- i.e. ""I can't answer that because of a pending SEC inquiry.""  As a result, we have been advised that we should not make any comment about the SEC inquiry in any context.

Subject: Rehearing on PG&E's GRC


Almost two years after issuing a decision in PG&E's GRC, the Commission
issued it rehearing order on October 16th and, lo and behold, actually
granted TURN's rehearing request in part.  The overall result is to reduce
the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3
million.  In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in
electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing.
Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.

1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, in
essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it
invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a 1998
forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast.
TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this
amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end
of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the
Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted
amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The
rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric
distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject to
refund.

2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution
capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.

3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was
reduced by $9.2 million.

4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify
the large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated that
PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount
by $7.9 million.

5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had
failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA
customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that
money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had
disallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission
disallowed $20 million.

6.  Customer Information Systems.  The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as
funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which they
had not received any benefits.

TXU Sells Two Texas Power
Plants to Exelon; Sale Supports
Strategies of Both Companies 



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from PRNewswire] TXU Corp. (NYSE: TXU) and Exelon Generation announced an agreement to sell two large TXU gas-fired electric generating plants to Exelon Generation, a subsidiary of Exelon Corp. (NYSE: EXC) for $433 million. The transaction, involving two Dallas/Fort Worth plants with a combined capacity of 2,334 MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its presence in the Texas region, enhancing its geographic and market diversity, while providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas. 

Analysis: Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the strategies of both companies particularly well. TXU, one of the largest generation companies in the world, has been attempting to expand out of its home state of Texas for some time, following competitive opportunities as they are presented by electric deregulation. The company, which will maintain a presence in the Texas market, has already expanded internationally into countries such as Australia and Europe, and will mostly likely use the proceeds from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the United States. For Exelon, the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Texas market, which becomes fully competitive next week, and provides a particularly valuable inroad into the high-demand region of Dallas/Fort Worth.

Let's first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is selling to Exelon. As noted, the combined capacity of the two plants is about 2,334 MW. One of the plants is the 1,441-MW Handley Steam Electric Station, which is located southeast of Fort Worth. According to TXU, 412,000 barrels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oil/gas units at the plant. Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington. The first unit was put into operation in 1948, with the additional units coming on line in 1950, 1963, 1976, and 1977. The other plant being sold is the 893-MW Mountain Creek Steam Electric Station, which is located about two miles west of Loop 12 in Dallas. With the first oil/gas unit established in 1945, four more units were added in 1949, 1956, 1958, and 1967. Both sales include the generating units of the plants, along with all of the other assets that are necessary for them to operate (land, water rights, transmission interconnections, gas pipeline interconnections, production facilities, and emission allowances).

The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pretty straightforward. From TXU's perspective, the sales will reduce the company's generation concentration in a single U.S. market, which up to this point has been primarily in its home state of Texas. Proceeds from the sale apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American markets outside of Texas. In addition, proceeds from the sale will be used to strengthen TXU's balance sheet by reducing debt, something that has become increasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy space since the bankruptcy of market-leader Enron. It is important to note that TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market, and still intends to operate in the state as a generation company and retailer. Note that according to Texas restructuring law, there must be a wall between the two operating units, which must function as separate companies. In essence, the divestiture is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that will support growth into other markets, and reduce the amount of potential market power that the company may have in Texas. 

The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the latter half of this year, considering that recent rulings by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have forced several other companies to charge cost-based prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to hold market power in their particular service territories. Texas law allows a company to own and control no more than 20 percent of capacity within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and TXU claims that it is within this cap. However, TXU acknowledges that it had an over-concentration of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other markets. Excluding the sold facilities, TXU will now own 18,651 MW of net capacity, which are still located primarily in Texas. However, it is becoming clear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market.

From Exelon's perspective, the sale expands the company's generating capacity by about 10 percent, which is an important increase considering that Exelon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industry's largest asset-based traders. Exelon, which was created as a result of the merger between PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison, is known mostly for its strong nuclear capabilities. In fact, Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, owning a total of 17 reactors that produce about 17,000 MW of power. Exelon may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio. Exelon Power, which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU, oversees Exelon's portfolio of coal, natural gas, oil, landfill gas, and hydro generating assets, which include 72 intermediate and peaking units in Pennsylvania and Maryland (capable of producing 4,800 MW of net generating capacity). Thus, Exelon's purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an effort to diversify, both regionally and from a power-source perspective, from the company's previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast. 

Perhaps equally important, the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas market, which represents the second-largest energy market (behind California), offering a market value of about $20 billion. Now that California is no longer a competitive energy market, there are high hopes that Texas will prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state next week. On Jan.1, 2002, most customers of investor-owned utilities in Texas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider (REP)-the company that provides their electricity. As a whole, the Texas energy market represents 70,000 MW of generation operating on a 37,000-mile transmission network. 

One of Exelon's main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation assets and position itself as one of the nation's top-tier energy suppliers. Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon, which up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago to Pennsylvania. This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into the Texas market. In the summer of 2001, Exelon began operating a new 165-MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston. Prior to that, Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from two other plants in Texas (830 MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and 350 MW from the Wolf Hollow plant).

It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas market, especially on the wholesale side of the business, and thus there are fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract. Under the sales agreement, Exelon Power, Exelon Generation's power plant operation arm, will assume operation of the plants. The transaction includes a tolling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase power during summer months for the next five years at market-based rates. Considering the standard definition of a tolling agreement, it is presumed that TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the summer months of the five-year contract, and then purchasing the electric output of the plants during that time. Interestingly, TXU is able to abide by Texas' requirement that it not own and control more than 20 percent within ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants. However, realistically, TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants, at least in the summer months during its five-year contract with Exelon. This raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract between TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas' deregulation plan.

"RE: Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy","With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Best,

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

"FERC meeting: SE RTO","Judge McCartney presented her report on the SE RTO mediation to FERC last Wed.  Her recommendation was for the Grid model: Transco on top/Independent Market Admin. (IMA) in the RTO (model presented by GridSouth, Grid Florida and Entergy) rather than Southern's model (Gridco on top, transmission owners and ind. transcos under).  The Commissioners did not make a decision, but stated that they planned to address the SE RTO at the next Commission meeting on Nov 7 (after they have received comments on RTO week).

The judge discussed the biggest obstacles to public power agreeing to the Grid model:  Southern gave them 100% transmission recovery on Day 1 and the Grids had a phase-in (pursuant to the Commission's previous orders in GridFlorida).  I think that many of the publics also liked the fact that Southern gave them full grandfathering of current contracts.

Chair Wood had questions about the split of responsibilities between the transmission-owning transco on top and the IMA and about the fiduciary duties of the transco board.  The judge stated that most publics wanted a non-profit ISO on top.  When Massey stated that most states wanted the traditional non-profit ISO, Wood said: ""that would put the cabosh on this model,"" then asked why the publics don't like the operating agreements with the RTO.  There was discussion about concerns that the transco would favor transmission solutions over gen.  Massey pointed out that the NE ISOs simply don't want their models changed, so that should not keep the Commission from approving the transco-type model.

Breathitt stated that cost/benefit analyses were important, especially for this region of low cost power.

Brownell stated that the Commission needed to act quickly because the market was already putting capital into transcos.

****************************************************************
POWELL OUTLINES 5-POINT 
AGENDA FOR COMMISSION

FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell today said he would apply his
deregulatory, market-based philosophy to address a host of issues,
the most important of which will be spurring deployment of
broadband services.  ""The widespread deployment of broadband
infrastructure has probably become the central communications
policy objective today,"" he said at a press briefing in Washington.

He stressed the importance of the FCC taking actions to spur the
""digital broadband migration.""  That could be an ""arduous"" process,
he said, but is ""essential to survival.""  He outlined five areas
that he said would drive the FCC's agenda for the next several
years:  (1) broadband deployment, (2) competition policy, (3) spec-
trum allocation policy, (4) a reexamination of the foundation of
media regulations, and (5) homeland security measures.

Shortly after he took over as chairman, Mr. Powell said he didn't
have a list of specific regulatory objectives that he planned to
pursue.  But today he sounded a different note.  ""It really
stresses me that we don't have a more coherent, cognizant vision of
what we're doing here,"" he said.  ""We're just running around
reacting to the latest"" issues.  The initial work to act on his
agenda will be started within six months and will be ""substantially
underway"" within a year, he said.

Various proceedings will be used to address his agenda, he said. 
""What we're going to try to do is create clearly identifiable
vehicles where key policy issues will be debated.""  Otherwise, he
said, ""the agency gets machine-gunned"" with petitions and other
filings from companies, trade groups, and other interested parties
trying to get action on particular issues.

Regarding broadband services, Mr. Powell stressed the importance of
limiting regulations that inhibit deployment.  ""It is clear that
substantial investment is required to build out the new networks,
and we should limit regulatory costs and regulatory uncertainty,""
he said.  ""Our focus should be on demonstrable and competitive
risks and discriminatory provisioning.""

As it mulls broadband regulations, the FCC plans to continue
studying the market and working with states, he said.  The agency
will ""clarify regulatory classification and access obligations
expeditiously,"" he said.  He cited three proceedings that would
focus on broadband services:  (1) the ongoing new networks pro-
ceeding, (2) the cable open-access proceeding, and (3) the third-
generation (3G) wireless spectrum allocation proceeding.

Regarding competition, Mr. Powell said the Commission needed ""to
make prudent course corrections in our policies"" to spur
competition.  ""Facilities-based competition is the ultimate
objective,"" he said.  He stressed the need for ""simplified
enforceable connection rules.""

More specifically, the chairman said the Commission would conclude
outstanding ""phase I"" pricing flexibility proceedings and initiate
a set of new proceedings over the next six months ""that will pro-
vide vehicles for rethinking our current framework.""

He said a ""triennial review"" would provide the principle docket for
evaluating unbundled network elements policy.  The Commission will
initiate a proceeding focusing on performance measurement and
enforcement in an ""attempt to streamline the essential performance
measures used for making judgments about compliance with the local
competition provision,"" he added.

He also said the agency would initiate a ""dominance and non-
dominance"" proceeding to ""ask how do we develop a framework that
might be used to deregulate on a carrier-specific or service-
specific basis, depending on the level of competition and market
power.""

On spectrum allocation, Mr. Powell found plenty of fault with the
way the government doles out valuable frequencies.  ""The nation's
approach to spectrum allocation is seriously fractured,"" he said,
adding it was ""a politicized, reactive process.""  He called for a
more comprehensive, market-driven policy that would allow spectrum
users to decide the best uses of bands.

The chairman said the Commission should encourage the development
of secondary spectrum markets, improve interference protection
standards, back the development of unlicensed frequencies, map out
the uses and users of all spectrum, promote spectral efficiency,
and protect frequencies used for public safety.

"Paul Hennemeyer","Rick -- here is the offer letter for Paul.  I believe it has everything noted except if we are going to allow for a house hunting trip prior to his moving.  I'm told this is usually done in conjunction with a business trip, so I'm not sure if that could be worked in for Paul.

In addition, to get any questions answered he may have about the benefits in Mexico, I would suggest that he call
Melizza Evanson, the HR Rep that is the liaison for our employees in Mexico.  She works very closely with the HR/Payroll people in Mexico and is the most knowledgeable.  Tim Callahan did say that the Benefits in the UK are greater than they are even in the US, and the benefits in the US are even greater than those in Mexico.  However, he didn't elaborate on the specifics of any particular benefits.  Melizza did say that the cost of living in Mexico is extremely low, so the employees there are provided with a driver, maids, etc. 

Anyway, take a look at the letter and let me know if you need any revisions.  And please have Paul call Melizza directly at 
(713) 345-7855 
with any questions.

Thanks.
Jo Ann

"Database Tracking of Activities","
	The Government Affairs group is involved in diverse and complex activities.  Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly  informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts.

	Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient.  We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes.  Currently this application is used primarily for RCR's, but beginning November 1, 2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts  - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification ""fire-drills"".  The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation.

	**  Please note that this will become the only way that we'll gather this information.  In other words, if you don't enter your data into Project Tracking, we won't know what you're doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated)

	The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product.  You'll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes.  Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction.

	Before the conversion of the project data from Lotus Notes to Oracle, we need to do some data cleanup.  Please expect a call in the next two weeks from Elizabeth Linnell, Bryan Gottfredson, or Darran Binns to schedule some time with you in person or on the phone regarding your current project list, additional projects to add, and a brief overview of the new system.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions and/or concerns.

The revised document that I sent to Robert is the same as what you saw, with the following additions:
 

The bullet point saying that NYMEX transactions are okay has been deleted based on Sarah's conversation with Adam Wenner.
The Enron affiliates with market-based rates are listed in the two footnotes.
Several ""plain English"" edits from Paul have been incorporated into the first page.

Sorry this went out so late.  I'll give you a call in the morning.

"RE: RTO Week Comments","My thoughts --

1.	Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for Enron because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).  Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.
2.	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.
3.	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.
4.	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.  Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.  The electric market needs transmission to be ""rationalized"" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.
5.	Should we attack the 209 Boards?  Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	RTO Week Comments

Comments on FERC's RTO Week are due on November 3 (Saturday) so we would like to submit comments by the end of this week.  Some of us have briefly discussed the types of comments we may want to submit on behalf of Enron, and the attached list of ""Talking Points"" are issues that Christi and I put together for Rick during his Washington meetings last week.  These talking points focus on issues that were raised during RTO Week by panelists that we may want to address -- either because the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  We will use the talking points as an outline on issues to raise in our comments.  

We also want to state up front in the comments that FERC is on the right track and that FERC has done a lot of analysis and studies to determine that ""right sized"" RTOs are in the public interest (this is in response to the negative comments made by the state commissioners that FERC is taking action that has not been proven to be beneficial to consumers).  We also want to make the point that RTO creation is not about retail access and does not impact whether or not a state offers retail choice.

Also attached is a link to FERC Staff's notes from RTO Week.  I have not reviewed these notes yet, but we may also want to respond to these notes in our comments using the same criteria as above; i.e., on areas where we feel that the point made was a good point that we want to highlight, or because the point made was wrong and we want to clarify the record.  

Please review the Talking Points paper and the Staff Notes, and let me know what you think about this strategy.  I am writing the comments and welcome all help and input.  

I hope to keep these comments limited (10 pages or so), so we need to stay focused -- raise the issue, make our point, and move on.  

Thanks Everyone

Sarah

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show
up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

Sandra
