"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Private Investors Align to Upgrade California's Path 15; 
Project Causes New State / Federal Conflicts 
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] The federal government has reached a deal with a coalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central California under a $300-million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state. Construction on the so-called Path 15 project, which was announced by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, will begin in the spring of 2003 and could be completed by as early as summer 2004.  
Analysis: The California energy crisis, which clearly subsided over the summer of 2001 due to new generation that came online in the state, mild weather patterns and conservation efforts, is generally considered the result of a severe supply / demand imbalance. While this may be true, what often gets overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the state-the lines that actually transport power from point A to point B-also played a primary role in creating the tremendous instability of California's energy market. This problem still persists today, and as California heads into the winter season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing. The Department of Energy (DOE) has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing a massive upgrade to California's main transmission line. While this is a positive step, the upgrade creates a new level of state / federal disputes for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into the hands of private companies, which creates a whole new set of potential conflicts. 
Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path 15 upgrade, there are some things that we know for sure. First, Path 15, which is owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., is a 90-mile high-voltage section of transmission capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern California. During the peak of the energy crisis in California, Path 15 became rather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks (points at which transmission could not transport high volumes of power). This pre-empted any transport of power from Southern California (and Arizona and Mexico) to the north, which resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern California cities. As noted, these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly acute during times of peak power demand, which is obviously a concern as winter approaches.  
The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the state's energy market. Ironically, power supply is no longer seen as an imminent problem. New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state should have operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 MW this winter, which has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous winter season. However, the report on the state's transmission system is not as positive. If the Northwest continues to experience a drought, then Northern California will still need to import more power from the south. Heavy dependence on the strained Path 15 could once again cause reliability problems for California. 
Thus, deficiencies along Path 15 can be seen as a symptom of larger problems that continue to plague California, and problems that have been the focus of both state and federal intervention for months, if not years. In fact, there is a history here that is worth noting, especially as it relates to federal / state jurisdiction. When President Bush released his national energy plan in April of this year, he directed the DOE to explore efforts that would relieve congestion along Path 15. Following through with this order, Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited responses from 13 companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path 15. The current contract, which will add a new line to the existing Path 15, is the result of that previous directive. 
At present, it appears that PG?Corp. (NYSE: PCG), the parent of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., and six other companies have signed on to financially support the upgrade. The six other companies that will spearhead the project are the Transmission Agency of Northern California, Trans-Elect, Inc., Kinder Morgan Power Co., PG?National Energy Group, Williams Energy Marketing and Trading, and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), a federal agency within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in 15 western states and operates 17,000 miles of transmission lines.  
Presently, Path 15 connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of the state's largest generation facilities-Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diablo Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energy's Morro Bay natural-gas power plant. The upgrade will reportedly include a new 500-kilovolt line that would boost transmission by about 1,500 MW from these two plants. Further, when the upgrade is finished in 2004, Path 15 should be able to carry a total of 5,400 MW of power. 
Of course, the first question that I asked was: Who is going to pay for the upgrade? The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain 10-percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line. The remaining 90 percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting different amounts of capital to fund the upgrade. The exact percentages of investment (and ownership) have yet to be defined, but should be revealed in a subsequent plan outlined in the next 90 days. You may ask why these companies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California. The answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments through fees charged to use the new transmission line. This could result in a hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project, who presumably anticipate that California will remain a high-demand state through which huge amounts of power will need to be transported. 
As I mentioned, there are some potential conflicts that might arise with this upgrade plan. First, there is the issue of potential state / federal regulatory conflicts. Presently, state governments have jurisdiction over power line siting. Thus, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) had already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path 15 prior to Secretary Abraham's call for private-company bids. Specifically, the CPUC had directed Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which it regulates, to upgrade the bottleneck spots along Path 15. As seems to be a growing occurrence, we may find that there is a state / federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulatory body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in California. Gov. Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is the state's prerogative, and have issued strong criticisms over the DOE's venture into this territory. However, in his energy plan, President Bush seemed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obtain transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission capacity.  If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE, it is not known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area. In any event, representatives from Trans-Elect, one of the participating companies, have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state (and public and private) interests will be one of the key challenges for the upgrade project. Note that Trans-Elect was the company that had unsuccessfully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California Edison earlier this year.   
Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOE's upgrade plan for Path 15 are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a major piece of California's transmission grid. The DOE-sponsored upgrade, unlike the one that the CPUC has directed, reportedly would not be subject to review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC. Further, because the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the new line, these companies will be able to charge ""tolls"" to the power marketers that use the lines to transport power. This is most likely a point of contention for California officials, especially Gov. Gray Davis, who has sought state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on private-company ownership of generation facilities in the state. The positive side of this issue is that, according to the DOE, the bids from private contracts enable the upgrade of Path 15 to proceed without any increase to ""either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of America."" 
As a side note, in addition to Path 15 the CPUC is also proceeding with a new transmission line in Southern California, known as the Valley-Rainbow Interconnect transmission line. Although the timetable has been delayed until 2005, San Diego Gas & Electric is proceeding with a 500,000-volt transmission line that would connect Southern California Edison's Valley Substation near Romoland, Calif., with a future substation to be located in the Rainbow, Calif. area, just south of the Riverside-San Diego county line. The new transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDG&E's and SCE's transmission systems. The first interconnection is at the San Onofre Substation near San Clemente, Calif. The project is designed to deliver approximately 1,000 MW.  
Moreover, the expansion of Path 15 is a necessary step to help California lower its risk for further reliability problems. Due to generation development, the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished, but the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors. The state government still has its hand in power purchases, which represents a huge part of the state's energy market. The state has accrued $12.5 billion in debt to buy power for the state's utilities, the recovery for which remains an unresolved issue. While Gov. Davis has preferred to increase the state's role in California's energy infrastructure, this new DOE-sponsored project on Path 15 puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands of private companies.

AES Hits Brick Wall in Venezuelan Acquisition 
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] Venezuelan telecommunications firm CANTV, or Compania Anomima Nacional Telefonos, facing a $1.37-billion hostile takeover bid by AES Corp. (NYSE: AES) has forced a showdown with the U.S.-based global power company by announcing a share repurchase program. The Board of Directors of CANTV, Venezuela's biggest telecommunications company, recommended that shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to 15 percent of CANTV's shares at a price of $30 per American Depositary Share (ADS), or approximately $4.29 per share. Analysts said the CANTV Board's proposals, which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set for Oct. 24, clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES.  
Analysis: AES' expansion in Latin America's telecommunications market was always seen as a risky move, and now that risk seems to be resulting in a big bite out of the company's strategy. CANTV, which was an appealing takeover target for AES due to its long-standing monopoly over the telecom market in Venezuela, has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), which holds a 28.5-percent stake in the company. Verizon came out in support of the 15-percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV, which clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES' efforts to gain control over the company. The repurchase could be seen as a power play, with Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV, which many analysts might see as a more appropriate synergy. However, this story also highlights the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin America, especially since CANTV's resistance comes on the heels of AES' pulling out of another acquisition project in Ecuador.  
For background, it is important to note that AES already owns 6.9 percent of CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas, Venezuela's largest private electricity company. Thus, the takeover effort is an attempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from Verizon.  CANTV, which was privatized a decade ago, is a full-service telecommunications provider offering switched and local, domestic and international long-distance service throughout Venezuela Company. CANTV also offers mobile cellular services, wireless services, Internet access and other value-added services, and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and national network of public telephone lines. CANTV became privatized about 10 years ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixed-line telephone service in Venezuela. The company has a market capitalization of $2.6 billion.  
AES had bid $24 in cash for each of the 28.57-million U.S.-listed shares in CANTV and $3.43 in cash for each of the 200 million shares of CANTV traded in Venezuela. AES' offer for CANTV's American shares represents a 9.2-percent premium over CANTV's closing price of $21.98 on Aug. 29, the time at which the takeover effort was launched. From the start of the offer, some critics charged that this bid was too low, but AES has maintained that the offer is fair. AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTV's mobile services, which account for about a quarter of the company's revenues, and distribute the proceeds to shareholders. 
CANTV was never very receptive to AES' bid, and did consider it to be a hostile takeover. In fact, workers' representatives at CANTV circulated a statement strongly objecting to the bid from AES, stating that the deal would severely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers. CANTV employees hold a 10.9-percent interest in the company. Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistance a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock. Note that CANTV will most likely issue the buyback program at $30, compared to the $24 that AES had offered. Thus, the challenge for AES, if it still wants to gain control over CANTV, will be to increase its already 9.2-percent premium offer. The word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed with its takeover attempt, and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attempts.  
AES' rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely twofold in nature. First, AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin American market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil, Chile and other countries. Just this week, AES announced its penetration of the Argentina market by inking a $376-million deal to purchase distribution and generation assets in that country from New Jersey-based Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG). In another recent announcement, AES launched a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificates of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile, a company that consists of 716 MW of generation and 1,056 kilometers of transmission. In fact, AES reportedly rivals Spain's Endesa as the region's most dominant power company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business throughout Latin America. Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the United States, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, many investors now perceive the company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America, which constitutes a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the various Latin American countries. 
However, AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a $128-million takeover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor. Currently, Edelnor, which is one of the largest electrical generators in Chile, is controlled by Mirant Corp., one of AES' direct competitors in the independent power producing market. Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region, Mirant has announced that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unless it can be assured of repayment. AES did not give a reason for its decision to terminate the Edelnor takeover, but one can surmise that investor reactor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor. Further, on Sept. 25, AES cut its earnings estimate for 2001 to a range of $1.25 to $1.45 per share from a previous range of $1.75 to $1.90. AES blamed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and U.S. dollar, lower U.K. power prices, and the company's inability to replace earnings anticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant. The drop in AES' earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the company needed to purchase Edelnor. 
AES shares were priced at $24.25 prior to the earnings revision. After the announcement, at least as of early morning trading on Sept. 27, AES shares were priced at $12.25, significantly down from the 52-week high of $73, which is what the stock was priced at a year ago. As of early morning trading on Oct. 17, AES shares were priced at $14.81. 
Moreover, investors did not react positively to AES' plan to increase its stake in CANTV. In fact, after word of the deal began to circulate on Aug. 29 (a day on which many stocks fell) AES' stock closed down $2.94, or 8.3 percent, to a 20-month low of $32.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. AES CEO Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase did not represent a change of strategy for AES, which he says will remain focused on power. In addition, Bakke noted that the purchase does not represent a new venture for AES as the company already holds telecom assets in Brazil and Bolivia. Further, Bakke clearly stated that AES is ""not going to announce a bunch of telecom acquisitions around the world."" Nevertheless, some investors believe that AES is imprudently expanding into the telecom sector, which is already significantly troubled, and becoming too heavily entrenched in Latin America, a market that is prone to political volatility. One investment analyst perhaps spoke for many when he commented that AES has little experience in the telecom sector and its limited experience to date has not been terribly successful. This, coupled with the general market downturn for most companies with telecom exposure, does not make for a good recipe from an investor's perspective, at least as of today.  
In fairness to AES, penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a very strategic move from a long-term perspective. With a population of 23.5 million, Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other related services. In addition, Venezuela is an asset-rich country, particularly with regard to oil resources. According to the Department of Energy, Venezuela is important to world energy markets because it holds proven oil reserves of 77 billion barrels, plus billions of barrels of extra-heavy oil and bitumen. Venezuela consistently ranks as one the top suppliers of U.S. oil imports and is among the top 10 crude oil producers in the world. In addition, as noted AES' investments in Latin America are not exclusively focused on Venezuela, as the company also is present in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, etc. 
Concerns about telecom arguably overshadow concerns about expansion in Latin America and play a larger role in the drop in AES' stock, especially when we consider that AES has been present in Latin America for some time. Only little more than a year ago, the telecom sector was at its peak, with billions of capital investment flooding into the sector as wildly optimistic expectations for demand seemingly exaggerated the scale of the market. However, a massive downturn has ensued, impacting not only companies operating in the telecom space but the nation's entire economy as well. The bottom of the telecom sector has fallen out, due in large part to the fact that the increase in bandwidth capacity has outpaced the growth in market demand.  
As I've said before when analyzing this company, the further that AES departs from its core strategy, the more likely it is that we will continue to see volatility in the company's stock. Up until these recent announcements, AES maintained that it was engaged in three lines of businesses, which were all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delivery services and retail energy marketing. Generation always appeared to be the main core of the company's business model, as AES controls some 125 facilities totaling over 44 gigawatts of capacity worldwide. This business model worked well for AES and was well received by investors. Any perceived deviation from this successful strategy-especially if it includes expansion into the dangerous territory of telecom-could mark a new and risky era for AES.  
Nevertheless, one could also surmise that AES has found a market opportunity that is worth exploring. Latin America has low electrification and Internet usage statistics. Some analysts project high growth in the next 5 to 10 years in Latin America in both electrification and Internet use, which in turn involves telecommunications. The telecom industry is struggling at the moment. Thus, if one believes that telecom will make a comeback, then buying now may make a wise strategy for those involved.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Rockland Electric Transfer to PJM","On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joint application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJM of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Enron's Departure from Core Business
Takes a Toll on Performance  
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) stock sustained further heavy losses on October 19 as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in over four years. The energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent at $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on Oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million. As of early morning trading on Oct. 22, Enron shares were priced at $21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new Securities and Exchange inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among investors. 
Analysis: Enron's first financial report since the departure of former CEO Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent years in recent memory. While Skilling cited personal reasons for his departure, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enron's share price and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. At the time of Skilling's departure, Enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week low. However, based on the new 3Q report, it now appears that Enron's downward turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company's top spot. In essence, Enron's financial problems have been caused by businesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its core focus on wholesale power sales. It appears that Enron is learning a costly lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company's innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromised. The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron, as a good number of unresolved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry into financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow the company. 
Let's first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the third quarter. As noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in losses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. When we break down the losses, it becomes clear that Enron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband and the retail power market. Specifically, Enron reported $287 million in charges from Azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in charges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including severance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 million in what the company is calling ""investment losses."" Evidently, about half of the $544-million figure is related to Enron's investment in NewPower Company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that Enron launched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM. Enron owns 45 percent of NewPower. In addition, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although Lay says that pending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002. However, it is important to note that Enron's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000. 
The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting. As one of the leading investors in the company, Enron drove NewPower's aggressive business focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns about the development of retail competition across the United States. NewPower went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days of its initial public offering was trading above that price. However, the company's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently priced at $1.25. NewPower is not scheduled to release its own 3Q financial statement until early November, but it is expected that the company will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Specifically, NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3Q loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Third-quarter revenue reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that the company had forecast in August.  
In analyzing NewPower's 2Q financial losses (see IssueAlert from 8/8/01 at www.scientech.com/rci ), I argued that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the United States. On the positive side, NewPower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts, most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from AES Corp. and DTE Energy. These purchases prompted an impressive growth spurt for NewPower, and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states. However, the bad news for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen, apparently resulting from a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the company operates. This dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better, and the company's stock has continued to drop as a result. 
In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, NewPower recently revised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp. and several of its subsidiaries. The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries through Jan. 4, 2002. With the lowered financial obligations that it must make to Enron, NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resources to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset-based financing.   
However, from Enron's perspective, the losses associated with NewPower (and, by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to a steady drop in its own stock price. The message is clear: The businesses that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as a whole. Further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enron's part has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently Wall Street has reacted by sending Enron's stock to a level that is about half of where it was a year ago. The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all unique, but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from what was a successful core business. Further, they are similar in that Enron aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which it arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. The problem with Enron's bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of fiber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's services from materializing as anticipated. The problem with Azurix, which has been losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the water sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies anticipated. In addition to these problem areas, Enron also faces challenges related to its investments in India (where it is locked into a legal battle with the state government) and California (from which Enron has yet to receive full payment for previous power sales).  
In addition to the losses outlined in the 3Q report, there are new issues that are brewing at the start of this week. First, the SEC has requested that Enron provide information regarding ""certain related party transactions."" Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry. However, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns related to the dealings of Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who up until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from Enron. Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SEC's request. In a separate development, several mutual funds (including AIM Constellation that once held large positions in Enron) have either liquidated or reduced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened Enron's stock value. Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about Enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an energy trader. 
The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company remains on solid ground despite the losses. Thus, Lay has been quick to reiterate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are still strong. Further, Lay says that the charges reported in the third quarter should be seen as a way to ""clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses."" Nevertheless, the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward its diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the company has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. Thus, several questions remain at this juncture. Are the losses reported in the third quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for the company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trading? Or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? Moving forward, will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? Only time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at Enron, which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change.

"FW: Comments on the Status of ENE ($16/sh).","


--------------- Authored by: Jeff Dietert ----------------
OUR VIEW:  ENE is down huge (-80% for the year, and trading at only
7.5xFY02) and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock.
More pressure is likely today on the news of S&P revising its long-term
ratings outlook to negative (based on the decline in market capitalization)
and ENE's additional draw on its credit facilities (which does not change
its net debt, but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in
the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating, which
could break covenants and restrict liquidity).  We believe the major issues
are: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and
persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate
the expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment
grade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture
plans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the
write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.

IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears
could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle,
investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the
rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings
force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to
generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to
clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete
explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to
stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road
show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification,
the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can
pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually
the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over
the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see
below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until
ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.

ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur
Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than
an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change.
With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset
divestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250
MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline
from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After
the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002,
we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be
break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end
of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys,
and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For
comparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp.
coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and
interest coverage is 3.8x.

IMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's
Wholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be
noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In
addition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger
the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible
preferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured
financing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an

investment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a
possible downgrade.   Last night S&P revised its long-term ratings outlook
to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market
capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's
financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to
rebuild its balance sheet.

BREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM
EBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are
conservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but
we are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas
Pipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x
multiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B.
Total asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B
or $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is,
if ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its
Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving
little for equity investors.

POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio
includes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&E is $14 B)
that has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the
last 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes
Elektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS
(a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations.
These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it
has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not
impaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of
these assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would
reduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating.
It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global
Assets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other
segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.

ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and
have not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading
volume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have
bought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing
business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have
over-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights
solidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete
discussion with the street?).

THE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its
attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with
the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow
participated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal
wrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative
concern over the appearance of the transactions.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Moody's Investors Service downgrads Enron","Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron Corp.'s long-term debt by one
notch this morning, a move sure to hamper the company's efforts to restore
investor and client confidence.
Shares of Enron fell to seven-year lows this morning, losing $1.51 to trade
at $13.89 in mid-day trading. In the past two weeks the stock has lost more
than half its value, dropping from as high as $35 at the beginning of
October.
Enron's rating was lowered by the bond rating firm from Baa1 to Baa2, where
it will remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said in a statement.
The firm also placed the Houston company's Prime-2 rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.
The Baa2 rating is just two notches above what is commonly called ""junk
bonds.""

Dynegy vs. Enron:
A ""Tale of Two Companies""  
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]
Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, reporting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the company's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the company's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 companies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778 people.  
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quarter, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000. Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company and is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron employs 20,600 people.  
Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be on a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the company's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same market space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story while Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in this article are: What is Dynegy doing ""right""? What is Enron doing ""wrong""? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this ""tale of two companies""? 
Although they are often referred to as ""cross-town rivals,"" Dynegy and Enron are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-most important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 2001. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, and-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strategy is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to which the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors. 
Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similarities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decidedly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary, let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs to own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of physical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry.  
Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does not necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues.  
As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of generation and 41,600 kilometers of electric T?lines) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled in that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewise in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, unlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its most recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint ownerships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector.  
Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, ""Dynegy's long-term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports earnings sustainability."" Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,000 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive areas. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy acquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating capacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, where it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in England. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best way to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the third quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale business.  
The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It is not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on infrastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By the same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities. 
On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly, by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential concern for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What Enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio. 
Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the ""great debate"" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall performance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband and water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trading business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay has been quick to reiterate to investors. ""Our 26-percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines,"" Lay said. ""The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."" 
Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new lines of business.  Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the leadership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company ""could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital"" and that Enron ""spent too much too soon"" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter.  
Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband business compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business. 
It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydirect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional transactions.  
At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my recollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet, and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will continue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. As noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. That doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous. 
In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on its more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone, 

	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game. 
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob. 

	We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Swanson  Staff  Reporter 10/19/2001 06:59 AM  EDT  1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?  One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY :OTC  BB ADR - news  - commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  the German chemical maker, which has seen its share price gain 10.4% since  the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the stock might be getting  ahead of themselves.    Bayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand for Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of  the company's overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year  (and, according to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its  acquisition of Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put the demand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S.  sales of the drug to be approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.     [IMAGE] [IMAGE]border=0 height=""280"" width=""336"">   [IMAGE]  Even emergency purchases of Cipro  probably won't add that much to Bayer's overall revenues. The president  has asked for $643 million for antibiotics to combat bioterrorist attacks.  While it's possible that sum will be increased, not all the money would be  spent on Cipro.    Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer  of Cipro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some  pressure in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from  other manufacturers.    On another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit  related to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It  was forced to withdraw the drug from the market.    Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's  a refuge for investors.    2. Losses at Twice the Price  You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are  double the price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (ITWO :Nasdaq  - news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  the supply-chain software maker. After market close on Tuesday, the company posted   losses under generally accepted accounting principles that amounted to  $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for the latest quarter, including all  charges.    In other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share  price, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.    Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the  purchase of Aspect Development in March 2000.    To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like  i2 typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordinary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so  bad: The company met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3  million, or 13 cents per share.    Still, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock  down 25% the day after they were reported.    3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks  In times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as  usual at many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT :Nasdaq  - news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis)   is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a competitor.    It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with  the words ""Microsoft Server Crunch"" to customers of rival server software  maker Novell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained ""a number of false  and misleading statements"" intended as putdowns of Novell products.   Among the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged  food. For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a  line on the Microsoft boxes read: ""What's the expiration date on that NetWare platform?"" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly  funny engineers.)    The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consulting services, which Novell says isn't true.    Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily  intended to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. ""It was  all in the theme of a mock cereal box,"" he said. ""It was a modest  campaign.""    In response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter  in September to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements,  and it's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For  the record, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified  money damages.    4. AMD's Feisty Pledge  CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be  too much to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical rough edges cross the line into embarrassing.    Case in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD :NYSE  - news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  which earlier this week reported a loss for the first time in almost three  years. The company, facing harsh pricing competition from Intel (INTC :Nasdaq  - news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  said its revenue was down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for the fourth quarter.    Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to  be extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference  call, he indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called ""Hammer"" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, ""We feel  that when the upturn comes, we're going to kick ---.""    Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders,  meet Mr. Reeves .    OK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But  his comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will  look better when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime  soon, what matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges  notwithstanding.    5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style  Analysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE :NYSE  - news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis)   rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produced results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they came  from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gotten even more unsettling.    To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted  a steep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop  that its shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion.    In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to the ""removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares."" According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased  55 million shares issued through a series of transactions involving LJM  Capital, a partnership that until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.    TSC's Peter Eavis has written   that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy Enron stock.    Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that  it had expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet  its accounting critics.    Enron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify exactly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest  revelation, to say the least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility. Enron, whose CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, had seen  its stock fall 59% for the year leading up to its latest earnings release.  Since then, it's dropped another 12.6%     Read our conflicts and  disclosure policy . Order reprints  of  TSC articles. Top   Back to Yahoo

U.S. Power Firms Plunge Into Europe's Trading Market;  
U.K.'s NETA Rules May Set Continental Standard  
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] U.S.-owned Entergy-Koch Trading (NYSE: EKT) is boosting its European electricity and weather trading business with expansion in Germany and the Netherlands. ""After a successful start, we plan to substantially increase our volume of European power, power options and weather trading next year,"" said Uday Narang, managing director of European trading. EKT also completed the paperwork needed to start trading electricity in France and Austria, although its immediate focus would be Germany and the Netherlands. 
Analysis: The announcement from Entergy-Koch Trading that it will significantly increase its European power trading business is by no means unique. In fact, a recent scan of announcements from U.S. power firms tells a similar story. Dynegy announced last week that it is seeking acquisitions to strengthen its European operations, in an effort to ""replicate its strong U.S. energy trading platform in Europe."" TXU said that it expects ""sharply higher profits this year"" from European energy trading as its electricity trading volumes have soared across the Continent. For the first nine months of 2001, TXU reportedly traded 211 terawatt hours of wholesale electricity in continental Europe, mostly in Germany, which compared to 97 terawatt hours in all of 2000. Further still, UtiliCorp just announced that it and an unnamed financial partner will be purchasing Midlands Electricity, the fourth-largest regional electric utility in the United Kingdom, which in addition to 38,000 miles of electric distribution lines owns a 1,875-MW power plant. The unrelated announcements have a common denominator: U.S. power firms are plunging into the European energy trading market in droves, despite some inherent governmental challenges and resistance toward embracing electric competition among some European countries. A new model in the United Kingdom, known as the new energy trading agreement (NETA) rules, appear to be facilitating more efficient trade in that country and could become the standard across the Continent.  
The appeal of Europe's power market for U.S. energy companies is perhaps obvious. According to a Financial Times Energy report from late last year, demand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity to be built (an amount roughly equivalent to the generating capacity of ERCOT in Texas). In addition, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's energy consumption has grown over the last two years. U.S. power firms, who perhaps see their competitive opportunities as being rather limited in this country, have expanded operations in Europe, where electric privatization is occurring on a country-by-country basis. Consequently, the companies mentioned above join Williams, Enron, Duke, AEP, and Mirant (to name a few), which have established London trading offices.  
Moreover, many of the U.S. power firms that expand into Europe start by accumulating generation assets in the United Kingdom, as represented by the UtiliCorp and Dynegy announcements. Much of this has to do with the fact that the United Kingdom began privatizing its electric market in the early 1990s and completed the process in May 1999 (after Norway, but well ahead of other European countries). However, there is a more important reason why U.S. energy firms may be drawn to U.K. power trading, and that is related to the area's unique rules for energy transactions, which were outlined in NETA and took effect in March of this year.  
To appreciate the significance of the new NETA rules, it is important to first understand the context of the European market as a whole and the trading system that had been in place in the United Kingdom until earlier this year. The European Union has directed countries across the Continent to open their electric markets to competition. Toward this end, the commencement of competition in various European countries has included the following three approaches: 1) allowing end-users the right to select an alternative provider; 2) giving generation companies the right to use an incumbent power supplier's transmission and distribution network, otherwise known as third-party access; and 3) the introduction of energy trading, which has allowed an incumbent supplier to buy power on the wholesale market. This last point is significant, because some of the European countries have dismantled previously integrated, state-owned utilities and mandated the divestiture of generation assets.  
At the end of 2000, approximately 68.4 percent of the European Union (EU) electricity market was open to competition. Privatization has theoretically enabled European power companies to expand beyond their traditional service territories and business lines into other countries (at least those that are open). That is the good news. However, the basic problem with this approach is that the European Union did not put standardized deadlines for the transition to a fully competitive marketplace, and thus various countries in Europe have developed their own timetables. For instance, Germany is fully privatized, while France has been notoriously hesitant to provide third-party access to competitors. In practice, this often means that one country may have an extremely complex system for transmission tariffs while its neighboring country may have not developed any standards at all. The other problem is that physical interconnections between countries are often deficient, which makes it difficult to transport power across borders. As a result, wholesale competition across the Continent is considered rather heterogeneous and lacking in comprehensive trading standards. The lack of standards is particularly acute as it relates to rules and tariffs for third-party access to the national grids on the Continent.  
While these fundamental problems on the Continent are being resolved, the United Kingdom has moved ahead with what is generally perceived as a more efficient market because it offers one grid system, one balancing and settlement code, and one contract format. However, even the power trading market in the United Kingdom did not get off to an easy start. Up until March of this year, the U.K. power market operated under a pool / auction system. Under that model, generation companies offered electricity for sale, which was then pooled into an auction system where day-ahead bids were made and power was sold in half-hour increments. The model was quite significant because it was one of the first attempts in the world to create a competitive market for generation and it operated outside of governmental oversight.  
However, the pool model in the United Kingdom became fraught with problems, mostly because observers believed that excessive opportunity existed for market manipulation. Given the concerns with the pool format, the United Kingdom began to formulate new rules for power trading in October 1998, which culminated in the NETA model that started this year. The key tenets that make NETA different from the previous pool model are: 
Forwards and futures markets, which allow participants to form power sale deals using standardized contracts either on-the-day or several years in advance (as opposed to only day-ahead bids). 
More flexibility regarding the kinds of contracts that buyers and sellers can negotiate (bilateral and multilateral contracts are allowed in the United Kingdom). 
A new balancing mechanism covering ancillary services overseen by National Grid Co. (operating in a role similar to an ISO), which facilitates the various transactions to ensure reliability. 
The administration of contracts linking wholesale supplies with demand (represented by individual meters), and the threat of strict penalties for participants whose positions do not match their metered volumes of electricity. 

In a nutshell, NETA essentially sharpened the rules surrounding power trading in the United Kingdom to allow less opportunity for gaming. The system improvements have been successful, and more international power firms apparently believe that they stand a better chance of competing in the United Kingdom due to the NETA rules. Installation of the NETA system reportedly has caused a 315-percent increase in the number of contracts traded, a 25-percent drop in wholesale prices and a six-fold increase in the variety of products offered. As of early summer 2001, about 150 new participants had registered to participate under the NETA system, as compared with about 12 under the former model.  
As noted, many believe that the NETA model will become a standard for the Continent as other European countries proceed with opening their wholesale markets to competition. In addition to the U.K.'s model, there are several active trading exchanges in Europe presently, although more are expected to emerge as the market becomes more competitive. The Nord Pool, with about 60 members, organizes trade in standardized physical and financial contracts, and provides current prices on electricity in both spot and futures markets. The Dutch Amsterdam Power Exchange has about 25 members and operates a spot market for electrical power. Smaller European exchanges, offering both spot and futures contracts, include the Switzerland Exchange and Germany's Leipzig Power Exchange in Frankfurt. In the meantime, I think we will continue to see additional U.S. power firms expanding into the European trading market, and using the United Kingdom as their launch pad.

Caminus and Altra Energy Partner to Create
Full-Service Trading Software Provider 
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] Software company Caminus Corp. (Nasdaq: CAMZ) announced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy Corp. Caminus said it would swap 1.975 shares of its stock and pay $30 million cash for Altra's software business. That values the deal at about $62 million, based on Caminus' closing price of $16.05 on Oct. 12.  
Analysis: The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces represents major news for the energy industry, particularly impacting those companies that are involved in the trading sector. On their own, both companies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche. Now that Caminus is acquiring Altra's software suite, which is primarily focused on the natural-gas trading sector, the synergy between the two companies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved in energy trading. Essentially, Altra has two core businesses-an energy trading exchange and a software business. Caminus has entered into an agreement process to purchase only the software side of Altra. Altra has a highly regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily focused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operations. Together, the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greater participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges.  
Let's first establish the business models of these two companies so that we can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create. Up to the point of this partnership, Caminus and Altra were not considered direct-line competitors, as Caminus' business model focused on risk management while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions. However, there were components of the companies' businesses that certainly overlapped. Caminus Corp. has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producers trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline, TradeSpark, HoustonStreet, etc. Altra's software, which is used in the same energy trading portals, focuses on natural-gas transactions.  
Headquartered in New York, Caminus, which went public a year ago, is a provider of software solutions (and consulting services) that help a wide range of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associated with energy trading. Toward that end, the company offers two software packages:
Zai*Net software solutions, which ""enables energy organizations to effectively trade and manage energy transactions."" Zai*Net has been designed to address a wide range of energy commodities, traded instruments and associated risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and third-party systems.

Nucleus software systems, which were designed specifically to meet the trading, risk management, scheduling, and accounting needs of utilities, generating companies, power pools, gas and oil producers, processors, pipelines, and other energy market participants. In other words, the Caminus Nucleus system provides a tool for energy traders to organize, track and manage their various energy transactions from generation to end-user delivery. One of the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets and market positions in real-time and consequently determine acceptable risk levels. 

Recently, Caminus added the Storefront product, which is a Web-based trading application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce transaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet. Also, just this week at the Power Mart conference in Houston, Caminus unveiled a new software product known as FrontOffice?, which gives traders of energy physicals and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affect a portfolio before committing to the transaction. According to company reports, approximately 80 percent of Caminus' revenue comes from software license sales. In addition, Caminus also has a consulting service that focuses on risk management services for energy clients.  
One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention lately is its efforts, along with other software companies, to establish a common standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to transaction / risk management systems. A few months ago, Caminus established the Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet, and has since generated interest in some 30 companies to participate and help create universal standards for energy trading. One of the key objectives of the Standards Group is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard protocol for energy trading platforms. The technology committee is reportedly working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions. 
In September, Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp., which primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions. Under the partnership, Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointly market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing, transaction, trading, and risk management systems to create what they are calling a ""Straight-Through Processing (STP)"" environment for vertically integrated energy companies.  
By comparison, Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that provides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry. Altra reportedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market. Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of direct access load, generation dispatch, regional transmission organization (RTO) connectivity, integrated OASIS reservations, and North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) checkout and billing. Altra boasts a customer list of about 100 clients, mostly in the gas sector but also including power and multi-fuel companies. Altra's software product suite includes transaction management tools known as Altra Gas, Altra Power, Altra Pipeline and Altra Web, which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity. 
According to Caminus, the value of acquiring Altra's software suite is to create an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both gas and power traders. Further, the exchange of customers should benefit both companies. Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management services to Altra's customer base, and in turn gain the opportunity to sell Altra's new generation of systems to Caminus customers.  
The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp. In fact, Caminus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently ""exploding."" According to Caminus CEO David Stoner, the global market for wholesale energy trading, which consists of the European market, is six to eight times the size of retail markets. Consequently, a typical therm gets traded a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user. Interestingly, about 30 to 40 percent of the companies to which Caminus has provided risk management consulting services are U.S. companies attempting to expand in the European wholesale trading market. Caminus consultants helped write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) for the British government, due to be implemented by the end of 2001 or early 2002. Although smaller than the U.S. market, Britain has been experiencing privatization and various levels of deregulation since 1983, providing valuable experience and depth. Besides the U.K., Caminus has been active throughout Europe in Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and the Nordic countries through NORDPOOL. 
Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently, when fallout from the events of Sept. 11 began to impact the company's business. For 2Q 2001, Caminus reported that its total revenues increased 58 percent to $17.7 million, compared to $11.2 million for 2Q 2000. Specifically, revenues from the company's software license fees increased 61 percent to $7.5 million during the same quarter. However, for 3Q 2001, Caminus lost $369,000, or 2 cents a share, on revenue of $14.7 million, due primarily to the fact some license sales that were expected to close did not. Specifically, Caminus says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the last month of each quarter. Given the impact that the events of Sept. 11 had on many companies, a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booked as scheduled. 
Moving forward, Caminus says that the addition of Altra's software should result in an increase of its 2002 revenue guidance by about 40 percent. Caminus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its 4Q earnings to 27 cents a share, compared with a previous estimate of 23 cents a share, although analysts are still projecting 19 cents a share for the fourth quarter.  
Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies to trade and market power in new regions. However, with these opportunities come considerable risks. Hence, creating this balance between risk and opportunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus and Altra operate. However, the software market in the energy trading space is becoming increasingly competitive. Every month, new competitors in this space emerge, so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list. However, some competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Caminus / Altra are Allegro Development, KWI and SolArc (to name just a few).  
Moreover, competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum, regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state. The wholesale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the retail market, and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the wholesale market before it reaches the end user. Thus, consolidation within the energy-trading software space should continue, and I would expect Caminus to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software into its service offerings.  

Clarification Statement to 10/16/01 IssueAlert on Dynegy: In its 3Q 2001 earnings statement, Dynegy reported that net income of its transmission and distribution company Illinois Power was $26 million, versus $27 million in 3Q 2000. In the 10/16 column, we incorrectly stated that Illinois Power had taken a loss of $15 million. The loss of $15 million was reported by Dynegy's telecommunications segment, which was duly noted in the article. We apologize for any confusion this error might have caused.

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times 
By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President 

[IMAGE]
Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday in response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' projections, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing its ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone ahead. 
Analysis:  Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level in seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent since May 1, 2001.  But perhaps what is most important about Constellation is its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the week to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts.  Earlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold off on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply Company, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until market conditions improve. 
The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same forces.  Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons for dropping its company-separation plans.  The company said it would now focus on using its ""single"" status to leverage its balance sheet to participate in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United States.  ""What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that comes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year) is the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for new power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound.  The world has changed,'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a conference call with the media.  
The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly.  The company will pay Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agreement, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $196 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business continued.  Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will cause the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth quarter.  The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable.  Goldman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the energy trading and marketing business.  In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take a 17.5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of Maryland deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a separate trading company.  Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain together.
It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other significant announcements concerning its future plans.  Mayo A. Shattuck III was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001.  Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche Banc. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for the past seven years.  On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission said it would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million.  Constellation Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group.  As part of the sale, Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at fixed prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license of Nine Mile 1 is not extended. 
The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bulk of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny.  Constellation's domestic merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per share of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share in earnings for the same quarter.  Allegheny Energy reported that their third-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and the acquisition of a trading and marketing unit.  Allegheny's third-quarter earnings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, and beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share.  Allegheny is confident that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3.80 to $4.10 per share.   
Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 percent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days.  The drop in energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power prices.  Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Allegheny's 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price assumptions.   
The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be over.  Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and softening wholesale market prices.  Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry:  ""One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth.""  
AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees.  Its earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain and said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets.  AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AES was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-term contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of flat growth.  Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets were very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for their product.  But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer response to the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one year ago in many parts of the country.   
The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fundamental shift in the electric business.  Their actions are, in some respects, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliability in their power supply costs, profits and operations.  Perhaps most significantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to whether or not they will continue to be an integrated business.  As Constellation concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of business is to remain an integrated company.  We would not be surprised if others come to the same conclusion.

Conectiv Completes Nuclear Plant Sales 
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]
[News item from PR Newswire] Conectiv (NYSE: CIV), an energy provider located in the Mid-Atlantic, announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic City Electric Company, completed the sale of its ownership interests in three nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company. The ownership interests were sold for approximately $11.3 million, excluding reimbursement of estimated fuel inventory, subject to adjustment. 
Analysis: This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week, but I did not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on what I think is a rather significant development. The transfer of ownership in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant because of its relation to Conectiv's unique competitive strategy and the round-robin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United States. Further, despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation's nuclear facilities, we still are seeing only a small number of companies that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States.  
The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectiv's ownership in the plants, which Conectiv shares with other companies (who also happen to be the buying partners in this sale). The breakdown of the sale of nuclear assets is as follows: 
A 7.51-percent interest (164 MW) in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3 sold in equal shares to co-owners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon. Prior to the transaction, PSEG Nuclear, an indirect subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, and Exelon each owned about 46 percent of the Peach Bottom plant. Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facility. 

A 7.41-percent interest (167 MW) in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Units 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which prior to the sale owned about 50 percent of the facility. PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the plant. 

A 5-percent interest (52 MW) in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station Units 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which is the operator of the plant and prior to the sale owned 95 percent of the facility. 

As noted, the significance of these transactions relates to Conectiv's competitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear sector. Let's look at Conectiv first.  
According to Conectiv's President and COO Thomas Shaw, the divestiture of the nuclear assets is consistent with the company's focused business strategy on two core energy businesses: Conectiv Energy, the company's integrated generation and asset optimization group, and Conectiv Power Delivery, the company's regulated delivery business. To support this two-tiered focus, Conectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants to expand a generation portfolio that includes only mid-merit plants (units that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns). Mid-merit plants are often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plants and peaker units. Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to operate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy trading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to provide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they are not needed to meet higher demands for power. 
The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of baseload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conectiv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications business (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for $20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-utility electric generator, for $9 million.  
Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained ownership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region. The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to repay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. Conectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conectiv is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the money to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating Station, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natural gas.  
The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload generation supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units only) and a regulated delivery business. Conectiv Power Delivery provides energy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Given the fairly distinct line between Conectiv's regulated and unregulated businesses, I have previously speculated that Conectiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand-alone company (a trend represented by AEP, Reliant and UtiliCorp). Conectiv is in the midst of major restructuring, so it is unlikely that any such spin off of its generation business would take place in the near term. However, as far as I know, Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused exclusively on mid-merit plants.  
Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco, a partnership that is scheduled to close in April 2002.  In this deal, Pepco is acquiring Conectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at $2.2 billion. Both companies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a later date. The partnership between these two relatively small and regionally based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity delivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region. By combining their two electricity delivery businesses, Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than double their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times. 
In the nuclear sector, it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG Nuclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Conectiv (despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained majority ownership in the plants). Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclear-power space, and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the license exchange on these three plants. Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, owning a total of 17 reactors. Earlier this year, Exelon CEO Corbin McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built in the next five years, and did not rule out the fact that his company might be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility. 
As noted, PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Enterprise Group Inc., which in 2000 was split into PSE&G, a regulated gas and electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power, an unregulated U.S. power generation company. As noted, PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek, N.J., and oversees PSEG Power's ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, located in Delta, Pa. When the Conectiv transaction is completed, PSEG Power will own 100 percent of Hope Creek, 52 percent of Salem, and 50 percent of Peach Bottom. 
In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear, Entergy Corp. is another company that deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector. Since 1999, Entergy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto the auction block. Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Units 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Entergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporation to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Entergy will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the  New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and 82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 million, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently increased its nuclear power assets. 
Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associated with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether or not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence.  Exelon, for example, is involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nuclear technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR).  Supporters of PBMR believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short construction time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power an acceptable option.  In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with the U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United States.  Clearly, steps are being taken to revive this controversial industry.

"results of football pool","Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Nuclear Experts Respond to Yucca Mountain IssueAlert 
 By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President
 
Brian O'Connell, P.E., Director of Nuclear Waste Program Office for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and Janet Schlueter, Chief of Staff and Nuclear Materials Assistant for Commissioner Edward McGaffigan of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), sent us several clarifying points concerning Yucca Mountain and nuclear waste, which we believe should be shared with our readership. 
The action taken by the NRC on October 23 was not an ""approval"" of the Yucca Mountain site. What the NRC approved was the ""site suitability guidelines""-the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Part 963 general repository siting guidelines that the DOE will use to evaluate Yucca Mountain when it submits a recommendation to the President on whether the site is ""suitable"" for the repository purpose. Then, after the unusual approval procedures of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the next step would be to submit a license application to the NRC to build the repository. The Commission's concurrence on DOE's general repository siting rule is separate and distinct from any comments NRC may have on DOE's preliminary site suitability recommendation. 
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), 2,000 metric tons are generated by the nuclear industry per year, not 30,000 tons per year as we reported. The entire industry has produced about 40,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel over the past four decades. 
Finally, the federal government may not be able to avoid responsibility for the actual transport of nuclear materials to Yucca Mountain.  Section 137(a)(2) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act does call for the DOE to ""utilize by contract private industry to the fullest extent possible."" Regardless of whether the shipments are made by the government or contractors, all shipments must meet NRC and other federal and state regulatory requirements.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.
Steve

[News item from Reuters] The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) signed off on a plan to build an underground dump in Nevada's Yucca Mountain to hold radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. Yet another step in a long approval process, the NRC approved a site suitability study submitted by the Department of Energy (DOE). The Bush administration must still submit that plan for congressional approval. The DOE in August gave a favorable safety assessment to the proposed project, which may face an uphill battle on Capitol Hill. It is heavily opposed by Democrat Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the new Senate assistant majority leader. 
Analysis: This is a major step toward establishing Yucca Mountain as the nation's repository for spent nuclear fuel, but the NRC approval of the site could be blocked by the pending vote in Congress. Since Sept. 11, new security issues certainly have been unearthed that may give legislators in Washington, D.C. pause, and support ongoing efforts to block the site. Nevertheless, after a decade of study, planning commissions and public debate, the NRC vote clearly represents the strongest endorsement of the Yucca Mountain site and could very well be an indication of how federal policymakers will side on the issue.  
For background, since the dawn of the nuclear age one generally accepted belief is that the most feasible and safest way to dispose of highly radioactive materials is to store them deep underground. From this starting point, the United States passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982 and charged the DOE with finding an appropriate spot in which radioactive materials could be stored. From the beginning, it was understood that the NRC would need to give approval to the location selected by the DOE and that congressional approval would also be necessary. In 1983, the DOE selected nine locations in six states for consideration as possible depositories, and at that time President Reagan approved only three of the nine locations for intensive scientific study (known as site characterization). The three locations were: Hanford, Wash.; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain, Nev. In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the DOE to only study Yucca Mountain as a suitable location, based on the finding from the earlier report. In other words, since that time no other location besides Yucca Mountain has even been considered as a potential repository for nuclear waste in the United States. 
The issue is critical because storage capacity for the waste from nuclear energy and weapons has become increasingly limited. The Bush administration's national energy plan, released last April, demonstrated strong support for the use of nuclear power as a supplement to more traditional fuel sources. Thus, the amount of nuclear waste in the country could increase considerably in the near future, and the location of an acceptable repository has become a top priority for the federal government.  
What makes Yucca Mountain the preferred location? According to the vast amount of research compiled over the last decade, there are several characteristics that arguably make Yucca Mountain the most appropriate repository site: it is a remote location and a long distance from a large population (100 miles from Las Vegas); it is located in a very dry climate, with less than six inches of water per year; and, the location offers an extremely deep water table (800 to 1,000 feet below the level of the potential repository). In addition, Yucca Mountain is located on federal land near the Nellis Air Force Range and the Nevada Test Site, where atomic-bomb tests once took place. Thus, it is considered a very secure area. Based on these characteristics, over the last 14 years scientists have generally concluded that Yucca Mountain is capable of isolating spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  
Under the evolving plan, the site reportedly would store underground thousands of tons of radioactive materials from the nation's nuclear plants for an estimated 10,000 years.  Yucca Mountain originally was scheduled to be used as the repository by 1998, but a delay in feasibility studies caused that date to be extended several times. It is presently expected that, assuming the site gains all the necessary approvals, Yucca Mountain would be used as a repository starting in 2010. 
However, while scientists may have been generally in agreement, reaching consensus among the other involved parties has been more difficult. From a federal perspective, President Bush and Vice President Cheney have supported the use of Yucca Mountain as a national repository. This belief has been shared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. However, Nevada state leaders have demonstrated fierce resistance toward the use of Yucca Mountain for the storage of nuclear waste, which has caused state / federal conflicts for the last several years. Specifically, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn and the Nevada Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa have said that they are opposed to using Yucca Mountain as a repository and reportedly believe that the entire issue should be put onto the back burner indefinitely, considering the recent national events.  
Water permits became one major conflict between state and federal officials. In fact, the federal government sued Nevada after the state refused to issue water permits that Yucca Mountain would need to operate. Nevada had granted water rights to the federal government, but only for the study purposes and not the actual use of the site. The issue is still working itself through various courts. The latest word is that an appeals panel said a federal court should decide the case because the proposed dumpsite is authorized under federal law.  
Those who oppose using Yucca Mountain as a repository have consistently outlined their concerns in public meetings. Basically, the top concern is that the radiation from the nuclear waste could seep through groundwater and into the aboveground environment. Yucca Mountain is reportedly located near a fault line, which has exacerbated concerns that the ground covering the potential repository could be subject to shifting. The location of Yucca Mountain, while touted as an advantage for proponents of the plan, has also been used by opponents as an argument against the plan. Specifically, opponents say that Yucca Mountain is too close to a commercial air corridor (located about 11 miles away), and that a large number of military flights routinely cross over the site. 
In addition, the events of Sept. 11 certainly have heightened concerns about potential targets for terrorist activity, and despite reassurances from scientists that the site is secure, opponents believe that no site would be attack-proof. Another concern is the actual transport of nuclear waste from various locations across the country to the proposed site at Yucca Mountain. The federal government reportedly claimed that it would not be responsible for the actual transport of nuclear materials to the Yucca Mountain site because the transportation would be handled by private companies.  Critics of the plan say that this creates an unacceptable vulnerability for the country.  
The next step will be for Energy Secretary Abraham to review all of the previously obtained material and make a recommendation to President Bush about whether or not the federal government should proceed with using the Yucca Mountain site. All indications have suggested that Secretary Abraham will side with scientists that Yucca Mountain is an appropriate site and, after nearly two decades of study, the pros of using this site outweigh the potential risks.  
Regardless of the ultimate decision, action on nuclear waste is necessary. The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material waste exists in the United States. However, if we take the range of estimates, it would equate to a football field ranging from 15 to 20 feet deep. That estimate takes into account all high-level nuclear waste generated in the United States since the start of a nuclear program in the 1950s. Compared to other hazardous materials, the amount of nuclear waste generated per year is very small. In the United States, all of the nuclear plants produce about 30,000 tons of spent fuel a year, whereas 300 million tons of chemical waste are generated per year.

"","HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2001 -- You can hear them approaching from hundreds of yards
away. That guttural, rumbling, roar can only denote one thing, a
Harley is near. Harley-Davidson Motor Company (Milwaukee, Wi.)
(NYSE:HDI) has been an institution in the motorcycle industry since
1903 when William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson first painted their
names on the gas tank of the first Harley-Davidson (H-D) Motorcycle.
Originally designed to be a racing bike, the H-D bike won its first
race in 1905 and never looked back.
	   As the most popular motorcycle in America, H-D is constantly
growing in an effort to keep pace with ever-increasing demand, and to
keep ahead of the research curve on new product development. The new
millennium appears to bode well for H-D as they have announced plans
to spend approximately $250 million on capital projects in 2001 alone.
This includes grassroot plants in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and
will position H-D to maintain its lead in the U.S. motorcycle
industry. In addition to planning brand new facilities, H-D is also
expanding and upgrading their existing plants and research centers. In
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, H-D is planning a 75,000 square foot (sqft)
office building addition and a 65,000 sqft plant expansion.
	   These expansions will enable H-D to maintain 800 jobs and create
393 new positions, something the Governor of the state is fully
behind. ""The company is expanding and upgrading equipment at two of
its Wisconsin facilities,"" says Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum.
""The quality of its products has helped raise Wisconsin's viability
around the world."" H-D shipped 200,000 motorcycles for the first time
in company history last year. H-D's internal company goals had
initially called for reaching that sales milestone by 2003, the year
they celebrate their first century of business.
	   Harley-Davidson, Incorporated is the largest U.S.-based motorcycle
manufacturer, and produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a
complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel, and general
merchandise.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

"Orders issued today in NYISO and ISO-NE proceedings","Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel","RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.
