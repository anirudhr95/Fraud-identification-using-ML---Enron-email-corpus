Hey,

Don't forget to call your benefits group regarding the $$$ that you have
placed in there.  Also don't forget to call Beta and see what the deal
is....

I'll be at Alex's school from 4:00 - 4:20 or so, so I'll pick you up at
4:30.

Subject:	Moody's Investors Service downgrads Enron

Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron Corp.'s long-term debt by one
notch this morning, a move sure to hamper the company's efforts to restore
investor and client confidence.
Shares of Enron fell to seven-year lows this morning, losing $1.51 to trade
at $13.89 in mid-day trading. In the past two weeks the stock has lost more
than half its value, dropping from as high as $35 at the beginning of
October.
Enron's rating was lowered by the bond rating firm from Baa1 to Baa2, where
it will remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said in a statement.
The firm also placed the Houston company's Prime-2 rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.
The Baa2 rating is just two notches above what is commonly called ""junk
bonds.""

> Enron Said To Be Takeover Target, Shell Tipped As Possible Bidder
> Oct. 28 (Power Finance & Risk)
> Enron, which 12 months ago was the darling of the energy markets, has
> become increasingly vulnerable to a takeover bid following the recent
> collapse of its share price, according to bankers and analysts. Royal
> Dutch/Shell is one likely bidder, they say, noting that Enron's relatively

> high of more than $55 billion--means that Shell and other potential
> acquirers would have little trouble digesting it whole. Cerris Tavinor, a
> spokeswoman for Shell, declined to comment. Calls to Enron were not
> returned.
> An M&A banker in London says the Anglo-Dutch oil giant was rumored to have
> approached Enron unsuccessfully in August. An analyst in New York adds
> Shell has courted Enron for more than three years. ""[Shell]'s downstream
> power business InterGen has not been as successful as it and its partner
> Bechtel hoped, especially in the U.S., and this would be a great fit,"" he
> continues.
> While many energy concerns would love to get their hands on Enron's hugely
> successful gas and electricity trading business, its forays into water,
> broadband and pulp and paper, might prove less attractive. Bidders may
> want to cherry pick the best parts of the business, reasons Peter Fusaro,
> president of Global Change Associates in New York. Still, he says ""there
> is a distinct possibility that it could be bought outright.""
> Another obstacle to any sale is believed to be CEO Kenneth Lay's
> unwillingness to sell the company at such a low stock price. Still, Lay
> has already given up the executive reins once, and at 61, he would
> probably be willing to sell if the premium was significantly rich, argues
> one New York based banker. Another adds that Lay will probably wait for

> Bankers argue that potential bidders would be unwilling to ride roughshod
> over Lay's wishes through a hostile bid as most of Enron's value is tied
> up in intellectual capital. Hostile bidders run the risk that senior staff
> will jump ship, argues a London banker.
> Another obstacle to any bid is concern that Enron may have additional
> skeletons in its financial closet. Last week's stock market selloff was
> prompted by Enron unexpectedly writing off some $1.2 billion in equity
