Mike,

It was nice to meet you last night.  At PanCanadian, I'm the gas options
trader, where much of my work is focused on clearing stuff for customer
business.  If you have the opportunity, let me know of any new options
products you guys are working on that I might be able to sell to our
producer, pipeline, and LDC customers for hedging.

Andy & Mike,

If you bring in your parking cards, you can get a parking spot in the new garage.  They have space available for you.  You have to give them your current card, in order to get your new card.  Please let me know if you would like to bring your current card this afternoon, or if you just want to bring it in the morning.  Someone can go down to the Parking & Transportation office on the 3rd floor and exchange it for you.

Thanks,
Laura

1.) Andrew Zipper was offered a space on Monday, August 6,2001 at 10:54 a.m.. But never replied to the e-mail.

2.) Mike Maggi was offered a space on May 18,2001 at 2:52 pm.. But never replied.

I do have two spaces available in the new garage for Mr. Maggi and Mr. Zipper. In exchange, please have them return the other parking card to the Parking & Transportation desk located on the 3rd floor.

Louis,

We are moving on to the 6th floor Trading area in the new building.  I have two financial traders under John Arnold who would like a spot in the garage (not reserved) and have not been offered that choice as of yet.  One is currently in the Allen Center and one is in the Clay Garage.  Please help me out on this if at all possible.  I would really like to make their day.

Their names are Mike Maggi and Andy Zipper.


Many thanks, 

Ina Rangel
