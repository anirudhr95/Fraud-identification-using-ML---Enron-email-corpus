What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested could be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

Daniel:  With respect to the Terms of Business Letter, please email a copy
of the proposed side letter (to handle arbitration and limitation of
liability).  I just want to review the ""final product"".  We have all other
documents ready for immediate execution.  Sorry for the delay and I
appreciate your patience.  Regards.

   Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
   amending
   the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

   Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
   language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

   I trust this will now close the open issues.

   I look forward to hearing from you

   Kind regards

   Daniel:

   Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
   relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
   If
   you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and
   we
   can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
   Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
   brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
   are
   not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
   other
   business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
   limitation
   of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

   ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
   any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
   punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

   Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
   office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

   All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
   executed
   together with the terms of business letter.

   Regards.  Sara

      The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
   relationship
      with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
   relate
      to
      the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the
   PB
      relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

      Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
      addressed
      in the documentation as drafted.

      I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible
   so
      we
      can try to get this wrapped up today.

      Kind regards

      Daniel:

      Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
      conflict
      because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
      requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
   Terms
      of
      Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
      Are
      you agreeing with this analysis?

      Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
      with
      the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
      (except
      for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
   Enron
      Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
      Terms
      of Business in the same manner.

      Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
   suggest a
      different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
      remaining
      documents.

         Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
      more
         appropriate to general terms of business which principally
      contemplate
         the
         regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event
   of
         inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

         I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

         Daniel:

         Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
   ""Agreement"")
         with my colleague Angela Davis.

         I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
      relating
         to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed
   but
         were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

         (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14
   of
         the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use
   of
         arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
      OSLA)
         so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
   the
         Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
      courts,
         I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
         prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

         (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
   manner
      as
         Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that
   you
         and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
   shouldn't
         these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

         I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
         account documentation.  Regards.

This guy was lonely, and decided life would be more fun if he had a pet. So
he went to the pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy an unusual
pet. After some discussion, he finally bought a centipede, which came in a
little white box to use for its  house. He took the box back home, found a
good location for the box, and decided he would start off by taking his new
pet to the bar to have a drink.
	     > >
He asked the centipede in the box, ""Would you like to go to Frank's with me
and have a beer?"" But there was no answer from his new pet.  This bothered
him a bit, but he waited a few minutes and then asked him again, ""How about
going to the bar and having a drink with me?"" But again, there was no answer
from his new friend and pet. So he waited a few minutes more, thinking about
the situation. He decided to ask him one more time; this time putting his
face up against the centipede's house and shouting, ""Hey, in there! Would
you like to go to Frank's place and have a drink with me?""
     > >
A little voice came out of the box: ""I heard you the first time! I'm putting
on my shoes"".

Hi, Paul:

Duke was one of the master netting agreements we were working on.  After checking with the lawyers who were assigned to work on the Duke master netting agreement, it appears that the agreement was never executed.

Let me know if you have any additional questions or need anything else.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

   on
   two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
   Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Did an English lawyer work on this?  If such a global netting agreement exists, could I trouble you for a copy?

Paul,

I've heard a rumour that there's a Global Netting Agreement for Duke.  Is there any way you can find this out?  They owe us, the gas guys and the continental guys money, but we apparently owe them loads in the states.

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

Richard:

As you can see below, I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you.  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I have turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I have completed finalizing the comments, but since AA sent their agreement in pdf (which cannot be edited), I have had to turn around a hard copy of our comments.  Can you give me a physical address where I can overnight our comments?

Thanks!

Bill, Cassandra, and Donna,

Please reply to this mail with your approval of the signing of the below documents which are needed to maintain an account that had previously been in use by ECT/ENA for execution of Bond Trades through prime broker acocunts.

As Enron Credit has now split out into its own entity new documents must be provided to the executing brokers.

Since we were trading in the old name prior with the counterparties this has only recently come up.  It is now disrupting our trading ability as vital couterparties have been restricted from further transactions with us.

Can we have a blanket approval to set up all bond counterparties registered with ECT/ENA to be set up for ECI as well.

Thanks,

Tom Doukas

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Thank you and best regards,

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Michelle Nelson needs to be immediately informed when c/p's agree to changes in independent amount so that the confirmations can be properly prepared and the margin team can do their work.

If in your view either Ltd or LP is expecting independent amounts different from those above, it is imperative that you immediately inform me and Marie Heard (she is preparing the updated confirmations).  

By copy of this email, I am asking Marie to hold off sending out the credit until this afternoon in order to give you time to respond.

   What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested
   could
   be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         I look forward to hearing from you

         Kind regards

         Daniel:

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

         Regards.  Sara

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Kind regards

            Daniel

            Daniel:

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the
            remaining
            documents.

            Thanks.

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the
               regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Kind regards

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         ""Agreement"")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.

"Bidder Rooms","We have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:

Team A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone
              Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 
              
	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies

Team B:  Main Conference Room 32c2
               Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof 

             Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies

Team C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.
              Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.

                         Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.


           I just met at noon with Lance Jameson who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  Lance thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.

We have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, Lance. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment.

Can you please check on the status of the confirmations for the Reliant/Bank of Montreal Ring Trades.  Please confirm that the confirmations have been reissued and ask to be informed immediately when we receive executed copies back from the counterparties.  This is a big transaction and we need to make sure that we get the confirms signed, sealed and delivered as soon as possible!

Thanks for your help with this.

I called Scott with no answer.  My contact does not know who he is, but suggested you could send the ECI and ENA agreements to her and she would ensure both were put in place with her legal and compliance people.

You can send the completed agreements to:

Kelly Keneally
11 Madison Ave, 5th Floor
NY, NY 10010
Phone: 212/538-5581
Fax: 212/538-4057

Please advise me when you send the documents out so I can ensure they are dealt with properly.

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

      Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
      amending
      the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

      Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
   the
      language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

      I trust this will now close the open issues.

      I look forward to hearing from you

      Kind regards

      Daniel:

      Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
      relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
      If
      you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
   and
      we
      can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber
   of
      Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
      brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
      are
      not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
      other
      business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
      limitation
      of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

      ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or
   from
      any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
   special,
      punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

      Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of
   the
      office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

      All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
      executed
      together with the terms of business letter.

      Regards.  Sara

         Sara

         The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
      relationship
         with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
      relate
         to
         the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with
   the
      PB
         relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

         Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
         addressed
         in the documentation as drafted.

         I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
   possible
      so
         we
         can try to get this wrapped up today.

         Kind regards

         Daniel

         Daniel:

         Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
         conflict
         because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
   Par.8
         requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
      Terms
         of
         Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
   prevail.
         Are
         you agreeing with this analysis?

         Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
   conflict
         with
         the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the
   PB
         (except
         for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
      Enron
         Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
   the
         Terms
         of Business in the same manner.

         Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
      suggest a
         different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
         remaining
         documents.

            Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
   Arbitration -
         more
            appropriate to general terms of business which principally
         contemplate
            the
            regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
   event
      of
            inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
   A3).

            I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

            Kind regards

            Daniel:

            Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
      ""Agreement"")
            with my colleague Angela Davis.

            I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
         relating
            to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
   discussed
      but
            were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

            (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par.
   14
      of
            the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible
   use
      of
            arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in
   the
         OSLA)
            so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
      the
            Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
   English
         courts,
            I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which
   will
            prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

            (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
      manner
         as
            Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
   that
      you
            and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
      shouldn't
            these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

            I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of
   the
            account documentation.  Regards.

Jay  
Subject: THE ANSWER TO NUMBER ELEVEN  
I don't know who David is, but his response is hilarious!!! Ya  know.......some people look for things like this...and it amazes me. At first I  rolled my eyes....then I read Dave's response and I couldn't have said it better  if I had all day to do it.  
Original Letter:  
The date of the attack: 9/11 - 9 + 1 + 1 = 11  
September 11th is the 254th day of the year: 2 + 5 + 4 = 11  
After September 11th there are 111 days left to the end of the year.  
119 is the area code to Iraq/Iran. 1 + 1 + 9 = 11  
Twin Towers - standing side by side, looks like the number 11  
The first plane to hit the towers was Flight 11 I Have More.......  State of New York - The 11th State added to the Union  
New York City - 11 Letters  
Afghanistan - 11 Letters  
The Pentagon - 11 Letters  
Ramzi Yousef - 11 Letters (convicted or orchestrating the attack at  the WTC in 1993)  
Flight 11 - 92 on board - 9 + 2 = 11  
Flight 77 - 65 on board - 6 + 5 = 11  
Dave's response: Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11  letters in the name""David Pawson!"" I'm going into hiding NOW. See you in a few  weeks. Wait a sec ... just realized ""YOU CAN'T HIDE"" also has 11 letters! What  am I gonna do? Help me!!! The terrorists are after me! ME! I can't believe it!  Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could hide! But no  ...""PLANET EARTH"" has 11 letters, too! Maybe Nostradamus can help me. But dare I  trust  
him? There are 11 letters in ""NOSTRADAMUS."" I know, the Red Cross can  help. No they can't...11 letters in ""THE RED CROSS,"" can't trust them. I would  rely on self defense, but ""SELF DEFENSE"" has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone  help? Anyone? If so, send me email. No, don't... ""SEND ME EMAIL"" has 11  letters.... Will this never end? I'm going insane! ""GOING INSANE???"" Eleven  letters!! Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though ""I'LL DIE  ALONE"" has 11 letters..... Oh my God, I just realized that America is doomed!  Our Independence Day is July 4th ... 7/4 ... 7+4=11!

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

Subject:	Investment companies

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

Please reply to this mail with your approval of the signing of the below documents which are needed to maintain an account that had previously been in use by ECT/ENA for execution of Bond Trades through prime broker acocunts.

As Enron Credit has now split out into its own entity new documents must be provided to the executing brokers.

Since we were trading in the old name prior with the counterparties this has only recently come up.  It is now disrupting our trading ability as vital couterparties have been restricted from further transactions with us.

Can we have a blanket approval to set up all bond counterparties registered with ECT/ENA to be set up for ECI as well.

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"RE:","Marie,

  It's been slow - but I think its going to pick up.  Send me a list of what you want to purchase and from where - as well as the address where you want it shipped.  I will then firnd out pricing for you.  It may take a little longer with the Robert Allen stuff since I have to open an account there.  I do not anticipate any problems getting the account open.  Maybe we can have lunch early next week.  Let me know what day is good for you,

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

Michelle:

With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff
for your non-regulated affiliates.  Perhaps you could provide us with the
regulated affiliate(s) for a carve out.  I look forward to hearing from
you.  Regards.

   Sara -

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

   Regards,
   Michelle

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         I look forward to hearing from you

         Kind regards

         Daniel:

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

         Regards.  Sara

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Daniel:

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the
            remaining
            documents.

            Thanks.

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the
               regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Kind regards

               Daniel

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         ""Agreement"")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.

Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we

What do you call a polar bear wearing ear muffs? 
Anything you want.  He can't hear you!  

Just before Christmas, an honest politician, a generous 
lawyer and  Santa Claus were riding in the elevator of 
a very posh hotel. Just before  the doors opened they all 
noticed a $20 bill lying on the floor. Which one  picked it up? 
Santa of course, because the other two don't exist!  

What happened when Santa's cat swallowed a ball of yarn? 
She had  mittens. 
   
What do you call it when your Christmas tree explodes? 
A tannen-bomb.  (tannenbaum)  

Why did Frosty go to live in the middle of the ocean? 
Because snow man  is an island.

  It's been slow - but I think its going to pick up.  Send me a list of what you want to purchase and from where - as well as the address where you want it shipped.  I will then firnd out pricing for you.  It may take a little longer with the Robert Allen stuff since I have to open an account there.  I do not anticipate any problems getting the account open.  Maybe we can have lunch early next week.  Let me know what day is good for you,

Can you please check on the status of the confirmations for the Reliant/Bank of Montreal Ring Trades.  Please confirm that the confirmations have been reissued and ask to be informed immediately when we receive executed copies back from the counterparties.  This is a big transaction and we need to make sure that we get the confirms signed, sealed and delivered as soon as possible!

Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

Thanks,

Tom

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Sara,

I called Scott with no answer.  My contact does not know who he is, but suggested you could send the ECI and ENA agreements to her and she would ensure both were put in place with her legal and compliance people.

You can send the completed agreements to:

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

"ISDA Master Agreements Required","Good Afternoon Marie,

Here is a list of inner company counterparties that require ISDA Master Agreements. I checked the Financial Trading Agreements listing in Lotus Notes to make sure an ISDA Master Agreement didn't already exist. Please double check your version in the event a counterparty was deleted as a result of the historical problem that we previously discussed regarding missing counterparty ISDA Master references.

ECT Europe Accounting				03/29/01
ECTRIC Crude					06/15/01

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Thanks.

"Credit Annexes","Legal friends - 

Patrick and I met with Jason Williams and Veronica Espinoza today to talk, in part, about the flow of information from credit to legal to confirms regarding Credit Attachments.  One area that I wanted to clarify with you folks is regarding the ""title"" of the Annexes.  Sometimes we receive an Annex B/B-1 where, underneath the CP name, there is reference to a specific deal number.   We attach it to the confirm, send it on its way, and we assume then that this Annex is deal specific.

This causes confusion in our groups, because when subsequent deals are transacted with the same counterparty, credit advises us to use the previously provided Annex.  However, when we go to attach what we believe to be the relevant Annex, we stop because it references another deal number.  Jay and Veronica informed us that the Annexes should not be deal specific, just counterparty specific. 

So.....unless there is some other reason of which we are not aware, would you guys be able to discontinue putting specific deal numbers on the Credit attachments you create?  

Let me know if I'm missing part of a bigger picture or if you have questions.

Thanks,
Diane

I have attached a new credit worksheet.  The new ISDA should be sent to Eric Shaw.  I'd like to move forward with negotiations even as we are waiting for the order from the court on the hedging. We can always wait to execute until you are comfortable.  We need to expedite this process; Rob Cooper and Craig Breslau want to trade ASAP and we must have the document in place.  I am going to mirror the terms in the Master Firm that I will send to Hodge so please coordinate with him. Please call with any questions regarding the terms.

Thanks,
Tanya

It looks like the Counterparty group inactivated this counterparty in their system effective 9/12/98 due to a name change to Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. but I can't find any documentation on this so we still have an active contract in Global.
 
Can you all shed any light on this as to whether or not this CP's contract should be terminated?

liability).  I just want to review the ""final product"".  We have all other

   Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
   amending
   the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

   Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
   language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

   I trust this will now close the open issues.

   I look forward to hearing from you

   Daniel:

   Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
   relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
   If
   you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and
   we
   can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
   Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
   brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
   are
   not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
   other
   business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
   limitation
   of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

   ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
   any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
   punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

   Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
   office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

   All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
   executed
   together with the terms of business letter.

   Regards.  Sara

      The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
   relationship
      with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
   relate
      to
      the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the
   PB
      relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

      Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
      addressed
      in the documentation as drafted.

      I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible
   so
      we
      can try to get this wrapped up today.

      Kind regards

      Daniel

      Daniel:

      Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
      conflict
      because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
      requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
   Terms
      of
      Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
      Are
      you agreeing with this analysis?

      Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
      with
      the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
      (except
      for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
   Enron
      Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
      Terms
      of Business in the same manner.

      Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
   suggest a
      different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
      remaining
      documents.

         Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
      more
         appropriate to general terms of business which principally
      contemplate
         the
         regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event
   of
         inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

         I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

         Daniel:

         Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
   ""Agreement"")
         with my colleague Angela Davis.

         I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
      relating
         to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed
   but
         were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

         (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14
   of
         the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use
   of
         arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
      OSLA)
         so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
   the
         Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
      courts,
         I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
         prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

         (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
   manner
      as
         Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that
   you
         and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
   shouldn't
         these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

         I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
         account documentation.  Regards.

I spoke with Yair about your suggestion to have a ""unilateral"" approach to

applied to both of us or neither of us).

"RE: Consolidated Edison Company of New York / Enron North America Corp - Proposed Credit Terms","If there are any outstanding legal issues outside of credit, please proceed working on the issues.  It appears that we missed out on an RFP because the contract has not been worked out.  This has now become a ""high"" priority from the desk.  If you would like, we can discuss further in the meeting today.

Subject:	Consolidated Edison Company of New York / Enron North America Corp - Proposed Credit Terms

Please review the following proposed outline of the credit lines for the proposed ISDA.


Collateral Threshold (tied to S&P and Moody ratings, lower of):	

	
					ConEd		Enron
	A+/A1 and above		$75,000,000	$60,000,000
	A, A-, A2, or A3			$60,000,000	$55,000,000
	BBB+, BBB, Baa1 or Baa2	$25,000,000	$50,000,000
	BBB- or Baa3			$5,000,000	$15,000,000
	Below BBB- or Baa3		$0		$0

I am trying to set parameters which give ConEd the credit that it deserves as an A+ regulated utility and Enron the credit it warrants as a BBB+ energy marketer.  Given the different business profiles of our companies, I don't believe that the application of parity should be practiced with regards to setting credit lines.  I think you would agree to this approach when looking at other market players, such as banks, municipalities, etc.  I hope we can come to agreement on the proposed credit lines, so that we can proceed with the negotiations of the ISDA.  Please call or reply with any comments or questions.

Hi, Mari:

I have prepared the separate phone list for each bidder room and am going to place five copies of each on the tables by the boxes in each room.

Let either Genia FitzGerald (x36389) or me (x33907) know if you need anything.  We will have our assistants bring coffee, etc., so if you will let us know when the groups arrive at the data room, we will take care of that.

Thanks!
