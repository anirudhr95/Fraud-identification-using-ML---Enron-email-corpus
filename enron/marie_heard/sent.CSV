Marie,

Good afternoon.  I am trying to locate a copy of our current ISDA agreement
with Enron.  Could you please fax me a copy of this document.  It would be
styled as either Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, LP
or simply Cornerstone Propane, LP.  Thanks so much for assistance.

Kate and Teresa:

We are working on a time sensitive project and ask that you assist us in determining the names of various Enron entities by doing an historical analysis or whatever means you use.

The entities I need info on are:

Enron Gas Processing Company
[Cole, Kate] 3/31/97 - Divested to KN Processing, Inc., subsidiary of KN Energy, Inc. 

Enron Gas Marketing Canada
[Cole, Kate]  5/3/94 - Enron Gas Liquids Canada, Ltd. and Canadian Gas Marketing Inc. amalgamated with Enron Gas Marketing Canada Inc. to form Enron Gas Services Canada Corp.

Enron Oil Canada Ltd
[Cole, Kate]  Divested:
08/16/99 - Spun off to EOG Resources and changed its name to EOG Resources Canada Inc.
.
Enron Oil Corporation
[Cole, Kate]  10/19/95 - Dissolved.

Are these prior names of current Enron entities, are they existing entities, etc.?

Please call me if you need any additional info or if my request is confusing.

Thanks for your help!

Hi Marie,

The fee letter looks good - and I have all of the paperwork here, except of
course the Termination letter for ENA Deal #0619, which you indicated the
Confirmation Desk was workin on.  So things look good to go.

I have the paperwork back from both Dynegy and Sempra, but United Oil's
letters is being reviewed by its lawyer today.  He was away for the past two
days.  As soon as I have everything together I will courier the complete
package to you - one detail that I forgot to mention - right now I have fax
copies only, and I hope it will suffice until I can get original signatures.
If it does not, then we are in real trouble!!  So say it is okay - and I
will work on the originals after the deal is completed.

Thanks for all your help, Marie.

Roeline

Marie,

I obtained the details from our London Tax Dept. this morning regarding the credit derivatives transaction entered into by Enron US in 2000 for its US operations.  The details are as follows:

Enron party:  ECT Investments Inc.
Counterparty:  Deutschebank
Buyer of protection:  Enron
Company for which protection is sought:  Loaise Corp. [spelling???]
Notional principal amount:  $4 MM
Commencement date:  July 19, 2000
Termination date:  July 19, 2005

Can you confirm that this transaction took place and remained on the books of our US operations?  I really appreciate your help with this.

Best regards,

I think it will be okay for them to sign.  They will need to print and sign two originals and return both copies to you.  Both David and John will need to initial before the agreements can be signed by an authorized officer.  Additionally, our notice information will need to be completed.  Once signed by Uecomm and returned to you, please let me know so that we can process the Enron Corp. guaranty or will David process it from your end?  Also, I don't know if you will keep the original in Australia or if it will come back to Houston.  Robbi, do you know?  We can cross that bridge once it is fully executed.

Hope this isn't too confusing!

The UK entities to sign are EEFT, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited, Enron Credit Limited and Enron Metals Limited.  Please leave the signature pages as set forth on the attached document, as Enron Metals may be deleted from the agreement.

Please take whatever steps are necessary to have the attached document signed ASAP.  Harlan Murphy (713/345-2679 is the lawyer here in Houston who prepared the document.  Please contact either Harlan, Mary Cook (713/345-7732), Elizabeth Sager (713/853-6349) or Carol St. Clair (713/853-3989) if you have any questions.

I spoke with Roeline Hudson at Torch just a few minutes ago.  She is having a medical procedure today and probably won't be back in the office until Monday.  She answered my question, so I will finalize drafts of the assignments and give them to one of the lawyers for review.  The lawyer may want verification from Torch as to the appropriate entity that is the counterparty to the transactions being assigned (specifically the Dynegy trades), which evidence of authority Roeline will have to send when she returns to the office on Monday.  Roeline stated that she has not received the additional documentation from UOM so she is not aware of any urgency in finalizing these assignments until all documentation has been delivered to us to finalize documents.  We will want to see the additional documentation from UOM before we send the drafts out for review.

Here is Russell's update on Torch....

 Torch-  I put a call into the person at Torch handling the assignment of the swaps, Roulene Hudson (Torch Credit), although she was not there.  I notified Marie Heard (our legal person x33907) of this, she will follow up with her questions, so she can send the drafts out.  Marie had some issues with the names on the confirms.

So, Maria should be attempting to get in touch with Roulene today regarding her questions.

Maria, please update everyone (Russell is out today) when you have updated information later today.

Marie,

I think  you were working on this ISDA, right?  Got a call from the marketer today and wanted to know the status. I informed him that legal was working on it but I can't remember where we left off.  I even looked in the Lotus Notes Database but couldn't find it listed.  Sorry to bug you with this!

Subject:	Current master

Howdy Marie,

I don't believe that we met when I was in Houston in February, but my name is Jim Weisser, and I'm with EBS Japan. I'm working on a couple of different counterparties to get a basic understanding of the master, and how it will operate, and I was wondering if you could help me out.

Could I please receive a copy of the current master, broken up a similar fashion as before? We previously had the credit support annex, the confirm and the master as three separate documents. Also, if it's possible to get it in word form (for me to make comments on, but not to distribute--little stuff mainly) as well as PDF, that would be fantastic.

Hi, Nidia!

Per my voice mail, attached is the revised form of guaranty to add ""Process Agent"" section.  Please send this revised form to the counterparty asking that they use this form rather than the form of guaranty you sent them on Friday.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Here is an e-mail from Chris Croom forwarding a counterparty's form of Confidentiality Agreement.  He is leaving town this afternoon to go meet with them, so he needs the CA ASAP.

I think I would first check with Kay Young to see if we have a CA with them, and if so, is it still active.  Maybe we can just work off that form since the counterparty has signed it before.

Let me know if you have questions or need help.

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.

Best Regards,
Athena

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
If you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
and we can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
Chamber of Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
non-prime brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
therefore, are not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.
We do have other business relationships with GSI and again request
inclusion of limitation of liability language in the terms of business
letter.  I propose:

""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
executed together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

Be sure to talk to Peter on any of the Canada related master nettings so he
can orchestrate any necessary Canada filings.  I have spoken with him on
this matter so he should be up to speed.  Any questions, stop by.

   We will need the ""organizational ID"" number for the Delaware, Maryland
   and
   Texas entities.  If you wish, we can obtain this information from CT
   Corp.
   or a similar service provider for a charge of $12 per entity.

   Also, for UCC filing purposes, we need to know whether any counterparty
   is
   a ""transmitting utility"", i.e., entity primarily engaged in transmitting
   or
   producing electricity or transmitting goods by pipeline.

   Finally, I assume you will consult with local counsel regarding the
   Canadian counterparties.

   Thank you.

All,
	Per Jay Williams approval, Russell Martinson of ConAgra Energy Services has requested an increase in Enron's outgoing guarantee of ENA to $30million from $20million.  In return, Enron has requested amendment to the ISDA giving ENA a credit threshold of $25million, up from $12.5million.  There will be no change in ConAgra credit.  Please prepare the appropriate amendments of the guarantee and ISDA to forward to Russell.  I am working on getting the mailing address to forward these documents, and will send it to you all once I receive it.  Please coordinate so both amendments can be sent at the same time.

Subject:	Deemed ISDA for Paper deal Andover E-Pulppaper (Hong Kong) Ltd.

Who is responsible for paper/pulp issues?  Paper desk needs a draft confirmation to go out to the above counterparty.  It's an international deal...so we need it to be on a Deemed ISDA, however, we've always done our paper/pulp deals on an omnibus.  Can I get a Deemed ISDA template from one of you? Thanks.

Hi, Sharon!

It's me again.  Can you get me a copy of the master physical agreement for Duke Energy Marketing L.P.?  It appears from the list below that this the only Canada master I need.  I have the ISDA.

This is my stab at the very complicated Duke relationship.  Please call with questions.  Janna Blanter at Duke should validate this list as well.  Call with questions.  The guaranties are a disaster because some of these are gtd by Duke Capital, others stand on their own or currently have an intermediate guarantor.  We should think about one all encompassing gty from Enron Corp and Duke Capital to simplify things.


Duke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC
	ENA ISDA
	EPMI EEI
	ENA Master Physical (currently in negotiation - Hodge)
	ENA Upstream physical gas - no master

Duke Energy Marketing LP
	ECC ISDA
	ECC Master Physical
	ENA Master Physical

Duke Energy Merchants LLC
	ENA ISDA (currently in negotiations - Hendry)
	ERAC physical crude (no master - should consider sending our new Master Crude - Aronowitz)
	

Duke Energy NGL Services LP
	ENA financial transactions - no ISDA 

Duke Energy Field Services Marketing LLC
	ENA financial transactions - no ISDA
	ENA physical gas - GISB maybe??

"Form of Guaranty","Mr. Lopez-Velarde:

Pursuant to our conversation attached is the form of guaranty that one of our business groups would like to send to a Mexican counterparty.  Francisco has asked if you would please revise the guaranty to provide for agent for service of process, submission to governing law in Texas and submission to jurisdiction in U.S. courts in Texas.  It appears that the form includes submission to jurisdiction in Texas and I have included a provision regarding agent for service of process.

As I stated, we would like to have these revisions as soon as possible this afternoon.

Thank you for your assistance.

  It's been slow - but I think its going to pick up.  Send me a list of what you want to purchase and from where - as well as the address where you want it shipped.  I will then firnd out pricing for you.  It may take a little longer with the Robert Allen stuff since I have to open an account there.  I do not anticipate any problems getting the account open.

Bill does not want to include any of the brokerage agreeements.  Also, I beleive we have kept Metals out of everyhting thus far and should continue to do so.  One point of note in the document is section 2 BNPP appears to have modified the language such that the Non Defaulting party can cherry pick which agreements it wants to terminate - this is unacceptable. To be honest, I am going to need your help walking me through this document as they have changed so much I am unclear in many instances  what their changes accomplish.  Please advise.

"RE: Confirmation Signing Authority","Kim:

We are in the process of cleaning this mess up. Sally Beck and Rogers Herndon are both given power of attorney to sign confirmations and they are both officers of ENA, so they can already sign documents.  Go figure!  If it's not too much trouble for you to verify those who should be removed then I can double check against my list.  I don't want to remove someone who should be left, nor do I want to leave someone on who should be removed.

Thanks for your help.

P.S.  For timing purposes, we are shooting for Monday to finalize documentation.

Marie,
I am also looking at the corporate workbook for ENA and who they list as Agent and Attorney-in-Fact.  I am not sure how accurate that info. is.  I see Jeff Harbert's name on there and we asked that he be removed earlier in the year.  I also see Mary Gosnell who is no longer with the company and also other people that used to be in the confirm group a long time ago but have moved on to other jobs.  Can you ask the person from corporate about this?

If need be, I can go through that list and submit a formal request to have those individuals rights removed.  Let  me know how we should proceed.  Thanks!

Kim

I have been asked by our corporate paralegal to assist him in cleaning up the ENA corporate database as those individuals who have been appointed agent and attorney-in-fact to sign confirmations in connection with financial transactions.  Mary Cook has a copy of an e-mail in the file to Brenda Herod setting forth the procedures and telling her that you verify the requests and notify Legal of any changes.  In this e-mail, apparently Brenda asked that Mike Moscoso's and Kristen Hanson's appointments be revoked and that Lisa McClendon be added.

Will you let me know of any changes that should be made at this time?

Thanks!

Andy Fastow signed this guaranty.  Bear Stearns is now asking for certificates as to authority and incumbency, so I have prepared and attach them for processing.

In addition, Enron Corp. executed a guaranty dated as of February 20, 2001 in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, et al, guaranteeing ENA's obligations under the Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement that were subsequently assigned to Enron Credit Inc.  We asked Bear Stearns to return the original Enron Corp. guaranty and apparently they have lost it.  In this regard, I am attaching a form of termination for that guaranty.  If it is in order, please process it for signature.

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

Marie,

  I just spoke to Robert Allen and they are going to send you a retun slip so that the 7 yards can be sent back via UPS without charge.  They have a 17 yard piece that they will ship to you.  I think the Houston show room screwed up the order - because I have a copy of what I sent them in writing - and it says 17 yards.  They have the 17 yards in stock so it shouldn't take long.  Just keep your eyes open for the return tag that they will send you in the mail for the 7 yards.  Ah -  the trials and tribulations of home decorating!

We had a meeting with Matt Kernot on Friday, about SMBP, SMSP, RCRC curves for UK power.
These are due to go live in the near term (if they haven't already)

The team is using various scalars to create HH curve if needed.

I was wondering if anyone in Risk or Research had looked at the validity of the curves and scalars and if Risk/Research is expected to sign off on these?

Subject:	Pemex Guaranty - Enron


Lucy:

Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes you
requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

1.	Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add that
""The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI"".  Please explain. [Heard, Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of enforceability. 

2.	Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt of
the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay with this change. 

3.	Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York Jurisdiction is
a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of derivatives
trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction
of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay with the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction. 

The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
finalize this as soon as posible.

Best regards,

Martha Navarro

Hey Paul.  Left you a vm earlier today.  The bottom portion of this email indicates what I was referring to.  I already have the Deemed ISDA for the LP that was approved mid October.  What I need is your blessing for the LTD.  I will be preparing two confirmations for each deal...for a total of four deals.  We bought at a strike of 650 October and now we have turned around to sell the same deal at 610.  They are both November 2001 deals.  No premium as they are swaps.  

Unfortunately, I will be working from home this afternoon so please either call me at 281-485-6520 or simply respond to this email.  FYI,  Marie Heard originally fowarded the Deemed ISDA's this past October.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Diane:
I just left you a voicemail about these deals. I have also inserted a comment on the actual deal ticket in the Tickets folder.
The payout from this deal basically has to be broken down between two different entities.

AIG, a hedge fund that we deal with, has done 2 weather trades: an original trade on 10/29/01 (W1597) and an offsetting one yesterday. 

Both trades need to be rebooked to reflect the fact that AIG allocates all its trades between 2 entities: AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund Ltd and AIG Commodity Arbitrage Fund LP. The split between the 2 counterparties is: 77% to Ltd and 23% to LP. 

At the moment, the original trade as well as (I'm assuming) the offsetting one are booked only to LP. Please rebook the trades, changing both the tick size and the cap amount, to reflect the above allocations. By my calculation, they should be as follows:

Entity				Tick Size			Cap
AIG Commodity Arb. Fund. Ltd	$1540				$308,000
AIG Commodity	Arb. Fund  LP	$460				$92,000

Once the deals are rebooked, please also reconfirm them this way. The confirmations will need to include a complete deemed ISDA (you can contact Diane Anderson if you need a copy of the specific deemed ISDA we use for DKR). 

Thanks a lot for this.
Rgds,
Russ

Mary Cook asked me to contact you regarding locating documents in connection with a couple of prepays.  The first is a prepay (December 13, 1999)  among ENA, Citibank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Toronto Dominion.  Is this Yosemite II?  If so, I have copies of the ISDA, swap confirms, etc.  Would you have copies of any other documents, or are there any other documents?  Also, they are looking for documentation in connection with the Corp. prepay for December 2000.  This was among ENA, Toronto Dominion, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley.  Do you happen to have copies of these documents or do you know the project name in case they were prepared here?

marie, I suspect that would it probably cause problems to put a provision to review the value of the guaranty in the actual guaranty document. It would be fine to stick with the standard guaranty wording. We will sort something out with them here regarding a process to review of the value of the guaranty.

Subject:	Enron Corp Guarantee for Optus contract

Marie,

We're down to the last item on signing a contract with Optus which would allow us to buy capacity from them in order to fill the circuit we sold to Uecomm (associated w/ the MSA).  They've requested a US$5 million parent guarantee from Enron Corp.  I don't know if this is standard, but they would like us to include some language that says we could review the amount in the future if needed.  But don't worry about this if it would slow things down.

Could you please arrange for a guarantee from Enron Corp?  How long does it take?  would it be possible to do it today (Wednesday)?  If we can get the guarantee and the contract executed by Thursday, Optus will have the circuit ready on Friday -- which is when our Customer needs it.

If you need any clarification, please feel free to call David Minns or me at any time.  My home number is 011-61-2-9360-1920.

Thanks

Pat

2. Part 5(p) Additional Definitions.  Quark does not have a prospectus.  In

be able to sign it once we get the final blessing from the Ministry of
Finance, they have to confirm that the guaranty does not represent
contingent public debt and therefore it does not require registration
with Hacienda.  We are checking everyday to make this happen as soon as

The guaranty cannot be dated as of January 1, 2001 as we got the

Just wondering if you could give me an update regarding the status of our
comments to the ISDA?  We have no place to get insistent, given the amount of
time it took us to compile our remarks.  Still, I'm sure everyone is eager to
get the issues resolved and the documents in place.

   Lucy:

   Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes
you
   requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

   1.      Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add
that
   ""The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
   Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI"".  Please explain.
[Heard,
   Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies
   the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of
   enforceability.

   2.      Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
   days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
   need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt
of
   the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay
with
   this change.

   3.      Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York
Jurisdiction is
   a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of
derivatives
   trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction
   of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard,
Marie]
      We are okay with the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction.

   The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
   be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
   finalize this as soon as posible.

   Best regards,

   Martha Navarro

I have sent the amendment to the Agency Agreement to Gary Hickerson for signature on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  When executed, I will fax you a copy.  How do you want to handle obtaining Michael Brown's signature?  Do you want me to send the original to you and you will coordinate getting his signature, or do you want me to send it to Michael directly?  I know Michael, so I don't have a problem with sending it directly to him, or I can certainly send it to someone in Legal in London to coordinate getting his signature.  Please let me know how you want to handle this.
 
In addition, I made a few minor changes to the amendment.  ECT Investments' name is ECT Investments, Inc. with a comma between ""Investments"" and ""Inc."".  Also, Gary Hickerson is President of ECT Investments rather than Managing Director, and I also added his and Michael's middle initials.

Subject:	FW: Status of Agreements (Goldman/J Aron)

The update on Goldman Sachs/J Aron Master Netting Agreement is that the legal form of the document has been agreed to with their inside counsel. We are waiting for Credit (Houston)'s approval before circulating for signature. I spoke with Tanya R. today. She said she would speak to Bill about GS' request to sign the cross-affiliate netting agreement w/o collateral. With Bill's approval, we can circulate for signature.

I apologize for not getting back to you on Friday, but it was pretty hectic here.  There are no special provisions for a German counterparty other than the tax reps.  We do have a treaty with Germany.

Let me know if you need anything else.

There are some issues with the master netting agreement and some of the big financing transactions.  Maybe that's what they are working on.  If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

Kravet will COD me and Schumacher will be charged to my credit card.  Once I place the orders I'll know the exact amount, including freight.  So I'll let you know.

Isn't it a big scam that these stores have!  The mark up is always between 40 and 50%, depending on the manufacturer.

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

"Proposed Enron Corp. Resolutions","Rebecca:

I am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.  I have attempted to revise them to make them clearer.  Perhaps Jim Armogida can assist in revising them as I am sure he is more familiar with the way Enron Corp. likes their resolutions drafted than we are.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

   Lech - A high priority Master Netting and Setoff Agreement (see
   attached) is in the late stages of negotiation with the below-referenced
   AEP affiliates.  The agreement is currently intended to be limited to
   masters/ transactions between ENA &/or EPMI and two major AEP trading
   affiliates, American Electric Power Service Corporation as Agent for the
   AEP Operating Companies (""AEP"") and AEP Energy Services, Inc.
   (""AEPESI"").  The Netting Agreement explicitly identifies enabling
   agreements between those entities relating to trading physical gas,
   physical power, and financial swaps.  Earlier today the Enron Credit
   group indicated that ENA trades (using GTCs) physical coal and physical
   synfuel with American Electric Power Service Corporation.  Please
   contact me with any questions. -- David

   Lucy:

   Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes
you
   requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

   1.      Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add
that
   ""The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
   Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI"".  Please explain.
[Heard,
   Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies
   the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of
   enforceability.

   2.      Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
   days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
   need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt
of
   the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay
with
   this change.

   3.      Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York
Jurisdiction is
   a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of
derivatives
   trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction
   of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard,
Marie]
      We are okay with the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction.

   The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
   be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
   finalize this as soon as posible.

   Best regards,

   Martha Navarro

Just wondering if you could give me an update regarding the status of our

Yes folks, after a hiatus of 5 years I again have  pecans for sale.  They are ready for  immediate pickup. I am selling them in ten pound bags at only $1.80/pound.  They are inshell(not  cracked).
Compare prices  --Wal-Mart $2.88/pound and Kroger's $2.49/pound.  Quality guaranteed.
 
Remember they make  great gifts especially at Thanksgiving.  You can have them cracked at the  Farmers Market for about .25/pound.  Tell your friends but hurry  supplies are limited. I will keep a supply until December 1 and then I will  take what I have left to the wholesaler.
 
Help the poor  downtrodden farmer.  We have taken it on the chin the last couple of  years with the severe drought and heat that we have  experienced.
 
E-mail your orders  are call me at 254.
 
 
Sincerely,

2.	First ""WHEREAS"" paragraph - ""WHEREAS, ....identified on Exhibits A and B hereto (whether one or more referred to herein collectively as the ""Transactions""), under the ISDA Master Agreement dated May 14, 1998...;"".

3.	Second ""WHEREAS"" paragraph - changed ""a"" to ""an"" before ""Assignment Agreement dagted April 25, 2001"".

4.	Paragraph 3 - changed ""Consent and Assignment"" to ""Consent to Assignment"".

5.	Paragraph 8 - ""As of...that certain ISDA Master Agreement, dated as of June 16, 1992..."".

6.	Signature Line changed from ""Enron Power Marketing, Inc."" to ""Enron North America Corp., formerly known as Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp."".

7.	Added Exhibit A (Natural Gas Transactions) and Exhibit B (Basis Swaps).

Individuals who have attained the level Vice President (or above) are authorized by the company bylaws to sign any contracts.  Thus Greg Hermans, Ray Bowen and Bob Crane would not need special authorization.  Brenda Herod and Lisa McClendon were authorized but have left the group so you might see some old confirms with their signatures.  I don't know anything about Debbie Nicholls.  

Marie, do you have any info on Debbie Nicholls?  Deb

No, I haven't received any original documents from Sempra.  If he sent them here I would surely have them by now.  Thanks for sending your copies--now I can get a big pile off my desk too.

We are trying to hold our own over here, hoping to miss the first round of layoffs.  It is still so incredibly unbelievable that this is happening.  It seems like a bad dream and any minute we will awaken.  It's supposed to be ""business as usual"" but it's pretty hard to get into the swing of things.  Hopefully everything will work out.

Hi Marie -

I have been trying to get the paperwork back from Sempra, however, Eric
Twombly keeps saying he thinks all assignment documents were returned to
Enron, including my copy.  I cannot get a confirmation that this is so
though.

So I thought I'd better check with you - please let me know whether you have
the Sempra assignment documents.  Also I wanted to send you the documents
signed by us, UOM and Dynegy - so as to get it off my desk.

Hope all is well with you - especially with what has happened in the past
two weeks.  Things sure do change in a hurry, don't they?

One more question - I received some of these in duplicate, and some of them
were original only.  Like the Termination Agreement that you just couriered
over to me - I only got one original from you, and there are two signatures.
We would like to have an original signature as well - so are we going to do
this after the fact?  That would be okay by me, because I want to have them
all signed and off my desk - so just let me know how you think we should do
this.

There is a company that will need to provide us with a guaranty prior to allowing access to trade on EOL.  The guaranty will cover physical NG and physical Power.  Through working with the financial legal team, a format has been discussed that covers multiple products for physical and financial business across multiple Enron entities.  Ideally, this is probably the best format to have a counterparty use.  Pursuant to instructions, I am not sending out a format to this company without having a member of the legal team give me the ok.  I was hoping that we could all coordinate on the multi-product, multi-entity format and possibly use it on a going forward basis.  Thanks for your help and please let me know if there are any questions.

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

Who is responsible for paper/pulp issues?  Paper desk needs a draft confirmation to go out to the above counterparty.  It's an international deal...so we need it to be on a Deemed ISDA, however, we've always done our paper/pulp deals on an omnibus.  Can I get a Deemed ISDA template from one of you? Thanks.

Sara and Ellen,

Attached below is a draft of the second amendment that we propose make to
the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of February 1, 1994 between General Re
Financial Products Corp. and Enron North America Corp.  The purpose of the
amendment is to eliminate the break language from the ISDA Master that we
added under the first amendment agreement.  Don Welstead in our Credit
Department asked me to forward this to you in April, but I think that I
failed to follow up on the assignment.

Please review the draft and revert to me with any comments that you might
have.  I can be reached at any time at Telephone: (212) 541-2561 /
Facsimile: (212) 541-2549 or via return e-mail.

Thanks a lot,

Hi gang!
Hope all is well with you all.  Just thought I'd give you all an update on
our new home, that is if all the inspections go smoothly.  It's in Browns
Pt., 4602 41st St. to be exact, it's described as a super clean rambler, new
carpet, vaulted ceilings with fireplace in living room, kitchen has
nook,island, family rm, big fenced backyard which seems well landscaped to
my standards anyway.  It has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 car garage w/ opener!
We'll be closer to family, friends,Steve's work & hopefully have a better
sense of community for Queen Isabel.  We're excited to say that we're just
outside Tuscany, which is where a beautiful community lies with $300k & up
homes.  Can't wait to have you all over to unpack, clean, paint, babysit &
mow the lawn, so mark your calendars for Nov. 30th! This is also Steve's
34th birthday, hmmmm I think I'll buy him a house, don't ruin the surprise.
Take care,
Jennifer

Ladies and gentlemen,

This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday, 6th July, to our triplets:

Benjamin James - at 12.45 pm - 3 lbs 4 ozs

Toby William - 12.46 pm - 4 lbs

Hannah May - 12.48 pm - 3 lbs 15 ozs.

Although small, they are all ""fully functioning"" and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care (and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights.  Emma is fine, too - very well!!

All the best and kind regards

Marie,

  I just spoke to Robert Allen and they are going to send you a retun slip so that the 7 yards can be sent back via UPS without charge.  They have a 17 yard piece that they will ship to you.  I think the Houston show room screwed up the order - because I have a copy of what I sent them in writing - and it says 17 yards.  They have the 17 yards in stock so it shouldn't take long.  Just keep your eyes open for the return tag that they will send you in the mail for the 7 yards.  Ah -  the trials and tribulations of home decorating!

Subject:	Credit Confidentiality Agreement Forms and Procedures

At the request of Credit, we have developed a form of Confidentiality Agreement for Credit to use when a Confidentiality Agreement is being prepared to obtain financial statements from a counterparty.  Credit should be able to send this form directly to a counterparty without having to go through Legal to draft the agreement.  We ask that Credit ensure following procedures are complied with.

1.  We are providing two forms.  One form is for all US and Canadian counterparties.  Mexican counterparties need a special form which is also attached below.
2.  The only change that should be made to the form is inserting the counterparty's name and address.  Please make sure you have the correct legal name of the counterparty.  NO OTHER CHANGES SHOULD BE MADE TO THE FORM.
3.  Pursuant to company policy, the agreements must be initialed by a lawyer before they can be executed.
4.  Bill Bradford or Rick Buy can execute the agreement.
5.  A copy of the fully executed agreement MUST BE PROVIDED TO KAY YOUNG IN LEGAL.  THIS IS CRITICAL!!!

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me a x33399.

Marie, I do not believe that Enron Canada was involved in either of the prepays you have described below.  To my knowledge (and I have checked with Peter and he has confirmed), the only prepay deal that has been done by ECC or out of the ECC office was the Alberta Prepay dated September 28, 2000 among ECC, Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, ENA and Chase.  The obligation was retired on September 28, 2001.  I believe Tana has all of the relevant documentation relating to that deal.  However, we do not have any of the documentation relating to the two deals you reference below.

Hi, Greg!

Mary Cook asked me to contact you regarding locating documents in connection with a couple of prepays.  The first is a prepay (December 13, 1999)  among ENA, Citibank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Toronto Dominion.  Is this Yosemite II?  If so, I have copies of the ISDA, swap confirms, etc.  Would you have copies of any other documents, or are there any other documents?  Also, they are looking for documentation in connection with the Corp. prepay for December 2000.  This was among ENA, Toronto Dominion, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley.  Do you happen to have copies of these documents or do you know the project name in case they were prepared here?

Sara,

Jeff Kinneman has suggested that perhaps legal could scan the executed document and edit the signature pages as opposed to recreate it since CSFB cannot provide the word document we requested.

However we decide to pursue this is still a priority as we are now shut off from trading.

Please advise as to what time frame we can expect the document to be completed.

We have received the original copy of the ISDA Master Agreement.  In looking through the supporting documents, we noted two outstanding items:

1.	We did not receive an original signed IRS Tax Form W-9 as required pursuant to Part 3(a); and

2.	The Certificate of Incumbency we received was not an original and was dated November 14, 2000.  We would like to receive an original certificate dated a current date.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact either Frank or me.  We look forward to receiving this documentation.

Sara: The second FPL entity is ""FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc.""  It is the FPL entity that handles all trades for the non-regulated business units of FPL.    We completed the ISDA agreements between Florida Power & Light Co. (the regulated utility) and ENA in early January and I then sent you on January 9th a red-line of the FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc./ENA drafts vs. the final executed Florida Power & Light Co./ENA agreements for ease of review, since the agreements were near twins though you may also recall that we had added a guaranty of FPL Group Capital Inc  (FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc. debt is unrated, FPL Group Capital Inc debt is single A).  I appreciate you assistance in helping to move this along.  Regards, -Serge

Serge:

Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:

(1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?

(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set
up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit
goup to react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry
picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express
language.

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis
of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading
forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition
of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day
limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be
included in any physical contract that will be included in a master
netting agreement, especially because of the current international
situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 <<MASTER NETTING & SECURITY AGMNT 10 H V1 RED.DOC>>
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms
with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate
document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 <<Master Netting User Notes.doc>>

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use
without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1
(to use with collateral annex).

I have checked our database and here is what I found:

Clorox - nothing has happened since you contacted them in May and they said they would send it in a few weeks.

Nestle - nothing since we sent them a revised draft in July, 1998.

Let us know if you want us to follow up with them.

I was under the impression that this ISDA was done and ready to be signed
over a month ago.  The NAV information hads been discussed and provided
before ( I have outlined it again below).  Are there any other issues that
Enron believes are open or is this it?  Please let me know immediately if
there are any other issues, if not please forward the final version for

Hi Marie,

The fee letter looks good - and I have all of the paperwork here, except of
course the Termination letter for ENA Deal #0619, which you indicated the
Confirmation Desk was workin on.  So things look good to go.

I have the paperwork back from both Dynegy and Sempra, but United Oil's
letters is being reviewed by its lawyer today.  He was away for the past two
days.  As soon as I have everything together I will courier the complete
package to you - one detail that I forgot to mention - right now I have fax
copies only, and I hope it will suffice until I can get original signatures.
If it does not, then we are in real trouble!!  So say it is okay - and I
will work on the originals after the deal is completed.

Thanks for all your help, Marie.

   Subject:  Pemex Guaranty - Enron


   Lucy:

   Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes
you
   requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

   1.      Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add
that
   ""The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
   Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI"".  Please explain.
[Heard,
   Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies
   the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of
   enforceability.

   2.      Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
   days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
   need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt
of
   the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay
with
   this change.

   3.      Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York
Jurisdiction is
   a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of
derivatives
   trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction
   of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard,
Marie]
      We are okay with the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction.

   The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
   be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
   finalize this as soon as posible.

   Best regards,

   Martha Navarro

Marie - per our conversation yesterday afternoon, attached are proposed drafts
of the Schedule and the Para. 13 relative to the above.  Having spoken with
Dennis Goldmann, I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in
the sum of $8M each:  one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f/b/o Enron, and one by
Enron Inc. f/b/o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing.  I am told that our respective
credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $10M for each party, but to
effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly.  Let me
know if this is your understanding, as well.

After you have had the chance to review the attached, please send me a marked-up
draft and we can discuss our concerns from there.

Should you have any questions, feel free to call me.  I can be reached at
315-460-3344.  Any credit concerns can be discussed with Dennis Goldmann, who
can be reached at 315-460-3349.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Marie,

GCP at times sends correspondence to customers requesting documentation (Sec of State) that is needed for name changes, mergers, etc.  Does anyone in Legal need to review this format before we continue with our process.

Please advise.

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357
3204), with any questions or comments.

Best regards, Steve Bunkin

With respect to Castrol Industrial North America, Inc. Legal does not have any contracts with this counterparty nor does the Confirmation desk have any documentation  that supports EESI doing business with this company.

If there is other info about this customer you may have, I could pass that along to the confirmation desk for further research.

Dear Osama Bin Laden, Yasser Arafat, and Sadam Hussein, et.al.,

We are pleased to announce that we unequivocally accept your challenge to an
old-fashioned game of whoop-ass. Now that we understand the rule that there
are no rules, we look forward to playing by them for the first time.

Since this game is a winner-take-all, we unfortunately are unable to
invite you to join us at the victory celebration. But rest assured that we
will toast you -- LITERALLY.

While we will admit that you are off to an impressive lead, it is however
now our turn at the plate.

By the way, we will be playing on your court now.
Batter up.

Sincerely,

The 270,000,000 citizens of the United States of America

Marie, the counterparty states that the Coverage Ratio should be 2.5, rather than 3.5. Will you please confirm that 2.5 is the correct amount?  If it is, I'll need to correct the original and send the counterparty a revised confirmation.

""Material Adverse Change"" means (a) with respect to Counterparty, it shall have any of the following occur at any time:  (i) the ratio of its Total Debt to Net Worth is more than 1.5 to 1, or (ii) its Net Worth falls below U.S. $70,000,000, or (iii) its EBITDA Coverage Ratio shall be less than 3.5 to 1; or (b) with respect to ENA, its Credit Support Provider's Credit Rating is below ""BBB-"" by S&P.

Thanks for your assistance!

Legal Team--

ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. would like to replace the current Gty's that Enron has issued to them and receive one overall gty to cover the financial and physical business with ENA, ECC, ENA Upstream Company, LLC, EPMI, EES and EGLI.  This would include the trading executed under the ISDA, GISB, and GTC's.  In executing this new gty, we would simultaneously cancel the existing outgoing Gty's that we have out to them already.  The cap amount on this new Gty would be $75MM.

Can you please advise whether this is acceptable or not so that I can tell the counterparty--we're currently avoiding posting cash on a Margin call as ONEOK will accept a higher Gty amount to cover their exposure.

Thanks,

Veronica

How do you want to handle obtaining Michael Brown's signature?  Do you want me to send the original to you and you will coordinate getting his signature, or do you want me to send it to Michael directly?  I know Michael, so I don't have a problem with sending it directly to him, or I can certainly send it to someone in Legal in London to coordinate getting his signature.  Please let me know how you want to handle this.
 
In addition, I made a few minor changes to the amendment.  ECT Investments' name is ECT Investments, Inc. with a comma between ""Investments"" and ""Inc."".  Also, Gary Hickerson is President of ECT Investments rather than Managing Director, and I also added his and Michael's middle initials.

Per my voice mail, we need a copy of a representative sample of whatever documentation BNP Paribas and Enron Metals Limited transact under (ISDA, general terms and conditions, etc.).  We are trying to finalize and sign a master netting agreement with them this morning and need to see this documentation as soon as possible.

My phone number is (713) 853-3907 and my fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!!!!!!!!!

Marie

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

"Proposed Enron Corp. Resolutions","Rebecca:

In connection with the upcoming Enron Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of Enron Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, Gary Hickerson's group typically goes to Andy Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers to authorize the transfer of funds from Enron Corp.'s brokerage account(s), in particular the account at Morgan Stanley.  Andy's title has changed and he has also asked that Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.

The attached resolutions have been drafted using the December 13, 1994 resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, with the exception of the deletion of non-existing offices, change in officer titles and the addition of Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain.  I am attaching a copy of the certificate we sent to Morgan Stanley in connection with the opening of the account for Enron Corp. certifying the December 13, 1994 resolutions. 

Thanks for your assistance and, please let us know if you have any questions or need any additional documentation.

Hi, Greg!

Wendy Conwell in Credit here in Houston forwarded this worksheet to us to prepare an omnibus confirmation for a deal between ECC and Atco Electric.  Since you guys are preparing confirms up there, I am forwarding the worksheet to you to prepare.  Francisco Pinto-Leite is marking up the counterparty form of guaranty and will forward it to you also.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Thanks!

Ms. Heard,

As we discussed, the following are our comments to the ISDA Master Agreement
that you sent to Terry Schultz on May 30, 2001:

General:
1.   Our name has changed from Cross Timbers Oil Company to XTO Energy Inc. (a
Delaware corporation)

Schedule to the Master Agreement
1.   Part 3.   We would incorporate the same language for Party B as applies to
Party A with regard to the delivery of financial statements.  Our website
address   is www.xtoenergy.com.  Propose that for both parties, strike the time
requirement for sending financials in the event not available online (i.e. ""in
no event  later than X days after the end of the X days following X period...""
2.   Part 5(g).  We like to strike ""or otherwise"" from line 4 and line 6

Credit Support Annex
1.   ""Threshold"" needs to be updated for Party B to $60 million.  This is
consistent with the threshold levels indicated in a letter from Jason Williams
dated     January 5, 2001.
2.   ""Material Adverse Change"" for Party B we would suggest that the definition
be rewritten so that if our credit rating with S&P falls below B+ that would be
a    MAC (a two notch downgrade, and consistent with the change for Party A).
In connection with this change we would propose striking the financial covenant
tests (i) & (ii).  This would also apply under the ""Eligibility to Hold Posted
Collateral"" section.  As a matter of form, this would permit us to strike the
definitions    of ""EBITDA"" and ""EBITDA Coverage Ratio"".
3.   We'd like to remove Schedule 1 showing the form of letter of credit.  This
is not consistent with our currently issued letter of credit, the terms of which
have      been accepted by Enron.
4.   We'd like to propose that the limit on the Enron guaranty to XTO Energy be
increased from $25 mm to $50 mm to give us a little more flexibility for future
deals.

Questions/Clarifications:
1.   Could you comment as to why under Part 1 (e) of the Schedule to the Master
Lease you have selected to use the ""Loss"" as opposed to the ""Market
Quotation"" method?  We have no other ISDAs with this calculation method.
2.   Under the Schedule to the Master Lease, what is the rationale for Part 4
(f) Netting of Payments?  We found this a little murky.

Please call me at 817-885-2260 if you have any questions about this comments.

Thanks very much.

Regards,
Adam Auten
Assistant Treasurer
XTO Energy Inc.

I think it's OK to just refer to the LLC Agreement. But you will see there
really aren't any restrictions in Quark's case.  The investment guidelines
are outlined in the LLC Agreement (Section 1.2 ""Purposes"").

I spoke with Frank about your proposed changes and he was okay with your
first change, however,  the definition of ""Investment Policy"" does appear
in Section 5(c)(i).  What documentation sets forth your investment
objectives, restrictions, etc.?

Also, do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached
to the ISDA?

Finally, we are awaiting copies of Quark's documents, those of its Manager
and those of any other relevant entities so that we can review them and
verify that there are no issues that would require delivery of a legal
opinion.

You'll love this.  ALCOA has sent us an amendment to the ISDA (that was signed 1/99) and wants to amend the ""threshold amount"" in Part 1 so that it corresponds to the current credit rating of the applicable party as indicated in Paragraph 13.  I think we are mixing apples and oranges!  Obviously they didn't understand the difference when they signed the ISDA in '99.  And it's the same lawyer sending the amendment who negotiated the master.

Subject:	Credit Confidentiality Agreement Forms and Procedures

At the request of Credit, we have developed a form of Confidentiality Agreement for Credit to use when a Confidentiality Agreement is being prepared to obtain financial statements from a counterparty.  Credit should be able to send this form directly to a counterparty without having to go through Legal to draft the agreement.  We ask that Credit ensure following procedures are complied with.

1.  We are providing two forms.  One form is for all US and Canadian counterparties.  Mexican counterparties need a special form which is also attached below.
2.  The only change that should be made to the form is inserting the counterparty's name and address.  Please make sure you have the correct legal name of the counterparty.  NO OTHER CHANGES SHOULD BE MADE TO THE FORM.
3.  Pursuant to company policy, the agreements must be initialed by a lawyer before they can be executed.
4.  Bill Bradford or Rick Buy can execute the agreement.
5.  A copy of the fully executed agreement MUST BE PROVIDED TO KAY YOUNG IN LEGAL.  THIS IS CRITICAL!!!

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call me a x33399.

Please let me know when you have signoff on the other documents and I will finalize and have executed by ENA and forward to you.

Thanks!

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the referenced account, Bear Stearns has agreed to allow ECT Europe to sign the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc. signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.  Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.

Subject:	FW: Enron Email

Dear Carol and Marie:

Following our conversation with Marie and voice mail to Carol, we are
attaching a version of the Master Netting Agreement that has been revised to
reflect our comments and marked to show changes.  As we indicated, we are
interested in pursuing implementing the agreement.  However, we are
concerned that the cross-affiliate netting provision may not be enforceable.
This concern has resulted in two important changes that are reflected in the
attached markup:  (i) we have changed the severability clause to provide
that the agreement would survive even if Section 3 is not enforceable and
(ii) we have removed the collateral provisions that are predicated on the
operation of cross-affiliate netting.

Please contact me at the number below, or my colleague Mike Brogan (212 357
3204), with any questions or comments.

Best regards, Steve Bunkin

Hi Marie, 
Our attorney has been on vacation most of this month, and unfortunately, we have not had the chance to review of your proposed ISDA documents.  Would it be possible for you to review our docs?  It will certainly help us out since we currently have a back log of unsigned ISDA contracts.  Please advise.
Thanks, Angie

"ENA resolutions","Matt:

Here is the proposed language re appointing agents and attorneys-in-fact to sign confirmations.  We may need to run these by Mark Taylor for approval, as he approves the trading resolutions.  We need to make the appointments effective as of 5/1/01.  Also, Bryan Burnett, Edward Ondarza and Stewart Seeligson are with EBS, so I don't know if they are still officers of ENA.  Didn't Max Yzaguirre leave Enron altogether?

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Thanks!

Marie,

  Are you free Thursday or Friday?  After Friday I am out for two weeks - yeah!  I would be happy to help you with your fabric needs.  I can tell you where I get discounts and you can look yourself - or, what may be better is if we go to the decorative center on our lunch hour (Friday would be best for me) and I could show you the stores and you could go back and look some more on your day off.  Your right that you do need a whole day - and the decorative center is only open Monday to Friday, 8 to 5.  Other places, like Calico Corners, do not give discounts to ""decorators"".  Let me know what you would like to do.  Also, I am ordering some fruit in jars for Jane and myself (like they have at the Energizer) I can get them a lot cheaper and have a catalog if your interested.  I offer my free services only to my bosom buddies!

Hi, Robbi!

Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you.  How are things going now that Lance and Carol are there?  Hopefully, better.  Mark gave me my review Thursday and I kept a copy of it to show you.  Kristina managed to get her digs in, but, fortunately, Mark  saw right through them.

Our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of Labor Day, so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs.  We thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on.  If your offer's still good, we would like your assistance in looking for fabric.  We were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans.  Would you let me know?

Also, we need to schedule a lunch with Erica and Jane.  What is best for you?

Talk to you later.

"RE: Assignment of OSLA","Anthony:

Attached for your review are clean and blacklined copies of your form of assignment, which note our comments.  Please let me know if the attached changes are acceptable.

The only outstanding issue on our executing the new OSLA in favor of Morgan Stanley Securities Limited is our review of the Borrower's warranties which were not a part of the OSLA we executed with Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited.

Thanks!

Subject:	GE Asian Options Deal #705475

Please find attached a confirmation for this deal (""sampledoc"").  I have changed the floating price language to reflect an Asian option (which I have never confirmed before), as opposed to our standard European options.  The standard floating price language for European Options is as follows:

The average of the hourly day-ahead prices as published by the New York Independent System Operator (the ""NYISO"") on the last day of the month that includes the applicable Determination Period on the NYISO's official web site currently located at http://mis.nyiso.com/public/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""Day Ahead Market LBMP - Zonal; Zonal Prices; West (61757) (Zone F)"" for electricity during the applicable Determination Period.

Please review the ""Floating Price"" section of this confirmation letter.

 << File: sampledoc.doc >> 
Please let me know if this confirmation correctly reflects an Asian option.  The trader would like for this confirmation to go out no later than today.  Please call me if you have any questions.
Thank You,

Subject:	Agreements for Reliant, Engage and Coral

Marie, we do not have a Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  We do, however, have a Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement with Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd. dated September 19, 1999.  Attached is a copy of the agreement (I will fax the signed execution page to you):

 << File: reliant.master5.clean.final.doc >> 

With respect to Engage Energy Canada L.P., attached is the Amended and Restated Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement dated January 4, 2001 (I will fax the signed execution page to you):

 << File: Amended&Restated.Master(2000)-5.doc >> 

I will have to fax the Firm Gas Sales Contract (15-year Sithe Supply) Agreement (plus the Amendment) to you, as I can't seem to locate it on the system.  Stephanie Panus should have a copy of the ISDA Master Agreement with Engage.  Are you able to get it from her or would you just like me to fax our copy to you?  ISDAs are not on our system as they are generated in Houston.

With respect to Coral Energy Canada, Inc., I will be faxing to you the following documents:

	- Letter from Shell Canada Limited dated June 1, 1997 assigning certain agreements to Coral (see Schedule ""A"" attached to letter)
	- Master Firm Gas P/S Agreement to you (again, I can't seem to locate it on the system) dated January 3, 1995
	- Firm Gas P/S Agreement (for transactions of 31 days or fewer) dated June 30, 1993(plus letter amending agreement dated June 13, 1994)
	- Interruptible Gas P/S Agreement dated October 21, 1993


If you need anything else after you've reviewed these documents, please let me know.

As you know,  I will  be question frequently regarding the status of this

I still haven't heard from these folks.  I talked to Steven Smith last week on 10/24/01 and he said there were no issues with the MSA, but he was having a hard time finding someone to sign it.  I told Jane this info last week.  I haven't heard back from him either via email or phone, should I pursue this further?  One more call before I go out on maternity leave?  I know Jane is anxious to get this back signed.

Here is an e-mail from Chris Croom forwarding a counterparty's form of Confidentiality Agreement.  He is leaving town this afternoon to go meet with them, so he needs the CA ASAP.

I think I would first check with Kay Young to see if we have a CA with them, and if so, is it still active.  Maybe we can just work off that form since the counterparty has signed it before.

Let me know if you have questions or need help.

Do you want for me to send UOM 's paperwork before I get the others?  I can

"Enron Corp. Resolutions - Brokerage Accounts","Jim:

In connection with the upcoming Enron Corp. Board Meeting, we have prepared, and attach for your review, resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts on behalf of Enron Corp.  The current resolutions are outdated because certain of the offices no longer exist or have changed.  In addition, the interest rate and currency desk typically goes to Andy Fastow when documents need to be signed or written or oral instructions need to be given to brokers.  Andy's title has changed and he has also asked that Ben Glisan and Tim DeSpain be authorized to sign documents and to give instructions in connection with these brokerage accounts.

The attached resolutions are substantially like the ones ENA has adopted in connection with the opening of brokerage accounts.  ENA also requires two officers to sign documents to open brokerage accounts, but allows only one officer to sign subsequent documentation and to give instructions to the brokers.

Would you please review the attached resolutions and advise if they are acceptable so that we can submit them to Rebecca Carter  by tomorrow, August 1.

Thanks for your assistance and, please let us know if you have any questions.

Once signed by Uecomm and returned to you, please let me know so that we can process the Enron Corp. guaranty or will David process it from your end?

Marie, I don't believe so.  I checked TAGG, and noticed that I executed the deals for Nemak, S.A (and therefore, would have provided you with a copy of everthing other than straight ISDAs for the counterparties).  Please let me know if you need for me to contact them for this document.

Have you received a W8BEN tax form and/or a legal opinion from Nemak?  They are supposed to deliver these to us in connection with the signed ISDA Master Agreement, but I haven't seen them and before I contact them, I thought I'd check just to make sure you didn't receive them.

Thankyou for the documentation you have provided in relation to ECT
Investments. We now have sufficient information to meet our regulatory

I have advised our sales-desk of this and requested that they arrange for
the account to be opened. We may need to obtain / re-confirm settlement and

Subject:	Pemex Guaranty - Enron


Lucy:

Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes you
requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

1.	Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add that
""The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI"".  Please explain. [Heard, Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of enforceability. 

2.	Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt of
the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay with this change. 

3.	Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York Jurisdiction is
a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of derivatives
trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction
of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay with the ""exclusive"" jurisdiction. 

The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
finalize this as soon as posible.

Best regards,

Martha Navarro

Hi Marie

Hope all is well.  I'm sure you've heard of all the changes going on down here.  Looks like you made a good decision moving to where you are.  

I have a question about EOL -- Cynthia said you had corresponded with someone named Bob (she thought this was his name) and were able to get up to date product descriptions with respect to EOL from this person.  Does any of this sound familiar?  I need to get Bob's name -- if this is the right person.

Let me know.

Marie--

Finally--I'm getting back to you with comments on these ISDA's.  Although the counterparty is now proposing something different, I thought I would send you this for your files.  I'm attaching the document that I went through for Georgia Power.  The changes to the documents are the same for all three, with exception of the specified thresholds.  The only difference will be the thresholds as follows:

Savannah Electric and Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B changed to $10MM will be acceptable, Threshold of $10MM will be acceptable, and the minimum transfer amount should be $100M (not $500 as they requested).
Mississippi Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B being changed to $20MM will be acceptable, Threshold should be countered to $15MM, and min transfer countered at $100M.
Georgia Power Company: Threshold info, etc is located in the attached document.

I've highlighted all of my comments in yellow below.  Again, the same comments (except for the thresholds, etc. mentioned above) should resemble the other two documents.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again and I apologize for the delay.

Do we have to wait for Board resolutions (December BOD mtg) to have Rick start signing, or can they be retroactive ie. ratifying what he's signed if he starts immediately.  I'd think we could do the latter, as that's what you had to do for me.

We prepared resolutions regarding the opening of brokerage agreements (the ones dated 11/30/2000), which authorized Cassandra to be a second signatory, however, the problem arose when we tried to get Kate Cole in the Corporate Secretary's office to certify a certificate of incumbency for Cassandra.  Cassandra has never officially been elected to the office of Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control, a division of Enron Corp., so as far as the corporate records are concerned, she is not officially a Vice President.  This will be resolved at the Enron Corp. Board Meeting in August and her appointment will be retroactive to November 1, 2000.  Until such time as this has occurred, she cannot be a second signature on our brokerage documents.

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the

the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc.
signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such
agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.

Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the

As you can see below, I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you.  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I have turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I have completed finalizing the comments, but since AA sent their agreement in pdf (which cannot be edited), I have had to turn around a hard copy of our comments.  Can you give me a physical address where I can overnight our comments?

  It's been slow - but I think its going to pick up.  Send me a list of what you want to purchase and from where - as well as the address where you want it shipped.  I will then firnd out pricing for you.  It may take a little longer with the Robert Allen stuff since I have to open an account there.  I do not anticipate any problems getting the account open.  Maybe we can have lunch early next week.  Let me know what day is good for you,

Hi, Edmund!

Can you help me obtain copies of some of your executed documents with BNP?  I need copies of the following:

1.	ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA

2.	Enron Credit Limited/BNPP ISDA

3.	ECTD /BNPP physical UK gas confirm (representative sample)

I hope you know who ECTD is cause I sure don't.  I am only assuming that because it's UK gas, it's a UK company.

My fax is (713) 646-3490.

  I just got a call from Dirk at Universal Access.  He was laid off - I thought he was a nice guy and a good lawyer.  Let me know if you hear about any openings.  Maybe we can make it to the decorative center next week.  If you want to go earlier, the number for Kravet is 4079171-B.  I will probably need to do Robert Allen in person since it is new.  Thanks

Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA schedule.  Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).  Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp. guaranty.

You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with reviewing same.

Thank you.

Liz Luthans with Petro-Hunt said that she still has not seen the ISDA for the above referenced companies.  It has been about a month or more since we started the process. She is out of the office July 3 thru 16 and has requested that she receive both masters before she leaves on vacation so that she can review and pass on to her legal.  I'm assuming that we have everything that we need from them, since we have not requested any information for them.

Hi, Edmund!

Can you help me obtain copies of some of your executed documents with BNP?  I need copies of the following:

1.	ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA

2.	Enron Credit Limited/BNPP ISDA

3.	ECTD /BNPP physical UK gas confirm (representative sample)

I hope you know who ECTD is cause I sure don't.  I am only assuming that because it's UK gas, it's a UK company.

My fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!

Subject:	AEGIS Confidentiality Agreement


I have been assisting Ron Bertrand in reviewing the proposed Confidentiality Agreement between Enron and AEGIS.  The original proposal was for a confidentiality agreement running to the benefit of AEGIS.  A subsequent comment from Sara Shackelton, however indicates that a two-way agreement is necessary.  As such there are several issues clauses that must be included to address issues unique to underwriting insurance.  Specifically (a) confidential information supplied in order to induce AEGIS to underwrite an insurance policy must be warranted (as in any insurance application), (b) AEGIS needs the right to share such information with reinsurers (who can be held to a confidentiality agreement), and (c) if a policy is purchased AEGIS need to retain the information in case there are any enforcement disputes that might turn on the application information.  The AEGIS standard confidentiality agreement used in underwriting situations is attached.
With regard to the revised draft of June 22nd. I note, in addition to the issues mentioned above, that the governing law provision is somewhat contradictory to the arbitration provisions and that the assumption in section 7 that confidentiality provisions will be incorporated in to the definitive agreement is usually not true for insurance policies.
Please feel free to contact me directly (201-521-4691) to conclude this matter.

Sara,

Yes.  I explained your view on the CSA to our Credit department.  They're
still eager to put a bilateral CSA in place.  We believe it is mutually
beneficial as the credit lines would not be exhausted too soon if we could
set up a mark-to-market collateral arrangement between the parties.

Could you please reconsider.  Have you considered the removal of the
arbitration provision?

No, I haven't received any original documents from Sempra.  If he sent them here I would surely have them by now.  Thanks for sending your copies--now I can get a big pile off my desk too.

We are trying to hold our own over here, hoping to miss the first round of layoffs.  It is still so incredibly unbelievable that this is happening.  It seems like a bad dream and any minute we will awaken.  It's supposed to be ""business as usual"" but it's pretty hard to get into the swing of things.  Hopefully everything will work out.

Hi Marie -

I have been trying to get the paperwork back from Sempra, however, Eric
Twombly keeps saying he thinks all assignment documents were returned to
Enron, including my copy.  I cannot get a confirmation that this is so
though.

So I thought I'd better check with you - please let me know whether you have
the Sempra assignment documents.  Also I wanted to send you the documents
signed by us, UOM and Dynegy - so as to get it off my desk.

Hope all is well with you - especially with what has happened in the past
two weeks.  Things sure do change in a hurry, don't they?

Subject:	Southern Company ISDA Master Agreements

We have been working on ISDA's with you for several of our subsidiaries
(Georgia Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Gulf Power Company and
Savannah Electric and Power Company).  Up to this point, we have wanted to
execute an ISDA for each of these companies.  Due to the way in which we
operate our generation assets as a single system, we have decided that we
need to change the way in which we enter these ISDA's.  We would like to
execute a single ISDA with you that includes six of our subsidiaries.  This
is how we have entered some of our physical trading contracts.  In this
arrangement, the counterparty on Southern's side would be listed as,

""Southern Company Services, Inc. as agent for Alabama Power Company, Georgia
Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah
Electric and Power Company, and Southern Power Company""

By using this approach, we have more flexibility in entering trades and it
provides even stronger credit protection for you since all six of these
companies are on the hook.  Probably the best way to proceed is for you to
forward your comments back to me from the last draft I sent to you.  I will
then make the changes to reflect this approach described above and send back
to you.  I look forward to receiving your comments back.  Please give me a
call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Subject:	EBS - ENE Asia capacity transaction
Importance:	High

In order to pick a path and move this deal forward, I would like to progress this deal with EBS Asia Pacific (a Singapore company) selling services to Enron Networks (a US company?).  Enron Networks can then charge back all the appropriate companies for the cost as it does with all the other services it provides.  Since we do not have a master agreement between EBS A/P and Enron Networks, I propose that we proceed along the following path:

1.  Michelle - can you please contact the appropriate Enron Networks attorney and see if he/she will execute a Master Agreement of the same form with EBS A/P
2.  Marie - if he/she will execute a new Master with EBS A/P, will you please draft, otherwise will you please submit the new short form GTCs and we will paper the deals with the GTCs

Once we have confirmed the entities and the form of document, we can quickly issue firm pricing offers, get approval from Barry on the price and issue deal tickets and start the approval process

Molly - since EBS has already transacted with Enron Networks, are we required to go thru the entire CAF process or is there a shorter process?

Our customer (Barry) has a great sense of urgency in this order and we still have significant lead times on ordering local loops so we need to resolve all issues so we can get loops on order.

Thanx for your help

Fred

Subject:	Master Netting Agreements Reminder

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks

Hi Marie -

I now have executed assignments from UOM and Dynegy.  I called Eric Twombly
at Sempra and he said that they may have sent it directly to Enron (you??).
I want to call Eric again today, but wanted to make sure first that he
indeed had not send the originals directly back to you - which is not what I
requested.

Please let me know - and thanks,
Roeline

"Decorator","Hi, Robbi!

Thought I'd e-mail you rather than call and interrupt you.  How are things going now that Lance and Carol are there?  Hopefully, better.  Mark gave me my review Thursday and I kept a copy of it to show you.  Kristina managed to get her digs in, but, fortunately, Mark  saw right through them.

Our contractor is going to start work on our house the week of Labor Day, so we are having to pack as much as we can to move upstairs.  We thought it would be perfect if we could find fabric to recover our furniture so that maybe we could send it out while the construction is going on.  If your offer's still good, we would like your assistance in looking for fabric.  We were hoping to take a day off to look for fabric but didn't know how that would fit into your plans.  Would you let me know?

Also, we need to schedule a lunch with Erica and Jane.  What is best for you?

Talk to you later.

Marie,

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  Providing financials for CSFB
Europe Ltd and CSFBi will not be a problem.  If we could get a copy of the
guarantee Enron Corp. will provide, my credit dept. will send out the ISDA
schedule.

One remaining question is will ECT collateralize their trades?  Thanks in

Ms. Rosenthal:

Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked
me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA
schedule.  Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide
a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like
for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated
entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).
Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp.
guaranty.

You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with
reviewing same.

Thank you.

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  Providing financials for CSFB

Ms. Rosenthal:

Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked
me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA
schedule.  Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide
a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like
for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated
entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).
Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp.
guaranty.

You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with
reviewing same.

Thank you.

Anyway, I thought I'd e-mail you since I don't have your home number in case you were going to the Decorative Center later this week to see if you could check out some samples for us if you had time.

At Beacon Hill  (Robert Allen):

Pattern:  Bearnson
Color:  Aged Gold

Pattern:  Scholtes
Color:  Cinnabar

Pattern:  McGeary
Color:  Citron

At Brunschwig & Fils (Gaston y Daniela):

Pattern No.:  82315-198
Name:  Chevron Woven Texture
Color:  Teja

Pattern No.:  82315 - 401
Name:  Chevron Woven Texture
Color:  Verde Agua

At Schumacher & Co. (Greeff)

Pattern No.:  3185017
Name:  Ephemera
Color:  Grass

Pattern No.:  3185046

If you don't go back to DC or have already gone, we can maybe find the Robert Allen samples at Expo. They sell his fabrics there.

Thanks!  We really appreciate your help.

Subject:	ONEOK Gty

Legal Team--

ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. would like to replace the current Gty's that Enron has issued to them and receive one overall gty to cover the financial and physical business with ENA, ECC, ENA Upstream Company, LLC, EPMI, EES and EGLI.  This would include the trading executed under the ISDA, GISB, and GTC's.  In executing this new gty, we would simultaneously cancel the existing outgoing Gty's that we have out to them already.  The cap amount on this new Gty would be $75MM.

Can you please advise whether this is acceptable or not so that I can tell the counterparty--we're currently avoiding posting cash on a Margin call as ONEOK will accept a higher Gty amount to cover their exposure.

Thanks,

Veronica

It is our understanding that in connection with the opening of the

the same form of Institutional Account Agreement that Enron Credit Inc.
signed in April, 2001.  Please forward execution copies of such
agreement to us and we will obtain execution on behalf of ECT Europe.
Additionally, we are in the process of adopting resolutions on behalf of
ECT Europe allowing for the opening of brokerage accounts.  Will Bear
Stearns be able to open the ECT Europe account prior to receiving the
corporate documentation?

Please see Tom Doukas's request below.  Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. et al dated March 29, 2001, with a $25,000,000 cap.  This guaranty secured obligations of Enron Credit, Inc. in connection with a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement.  The cap was increased to $100,000,000 by amendment dated May 15, 2001.  Are you okay with adding ECT Europe Finance, Inc. as an additional guaranteed party?

Marie--

Finally--I'm getting back to you with comments on these ISDA's.  Although the counterparty is now proposing something different, I thought I would send you this for your files.  I'm attaching the document that I went through for Georgia Power.  The changes to the documents are the same for all three, with exception of the specified thresholds.  The only difference will be the thresholds as follows:

Savannah Electric and Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B changed to $10MM will be acceptable, Threshold of $10MM will be acceptable, and the minimum transfer amount should be $100M (not $500 as they requested).
Mississippi Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B being changed to $20MM will be acceptable, Threshold should be countered to $15MM, and min transfer countered at $100M.
Georgia Power Company: Threshold info, etc is located in the attached document.

I've highlighted all of my comments in yellow below.  Again, the same comments (except for the thresholds, etc. mentioned above) should resemble the other two documents.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again and I apologize for the delay.

Hi, David:

As you can see, I have forwarded the master agreement to Mr. Sill for execution.  When you receive the executed copies, please complete the notice information on the Schedule.  I'm sure Pat can assist in the technical contacts if you aren't familiar with them.  In addition, please initial both copies and have John Suttle initial both copies before they are signed by EBS Asia/Pacific Pte Ltd.  Upon execution, please forward one fully signed copy to Mr. Sill and forward the other original copy to me in Houston.

I am processing the original Enron Corp. guaranty and will forward it to Uecomm when I receive it back from Enron Corp. and receive confirmation from you that you have the master agreement as signed by Uecomm.

Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Glad to hear that they are all healthy and were a good size, and that Mom is doing well.  Look forward to seeing pictures of the little ones.  I know you all are going to have so much fun with them.  Hope you've been storing up sleep, cause it looks like you won't be getting much for a while.

Again, congratulations.  These three little ones don't realize how lucky they are to have such a nice Dad, but I'm sure they'll find out soon.

Ladies and gentlemen,

This is just to let you know that Emma gave birth at week 34 on Friday, 6th July, to our triplets:

Benjamin James - at 12.45 pm - 3 lbs 4 ozs

Toby William - 12.46 pm - 4 lbs

Hannah May - 12.48 pm - 3 lbs 15 ozs.

Although small, they are all ""fully functioning"" and very well - they are in the lowest level of special care (and they will probably be in there for another two to four weeks) until they can feed properly and maintain their weights.  Emma is fine, too - very well!!

All the best and kind regards

Subject:	Lotus Notes

I just got a call from Rob Wheeler, one of our power dealmakers, quizzing me about 15 counterparties he was interested in the status of the masters/guaranties our group is working on.  What I found out was in situations where we are reviewing counterparty guaranties unassociated with a master or an confirmation, there is no record in Lotus Notes to tell us who is working on the guaranty so I was unable to tell him whether we had it, who was working on it or what the status was.  It didn't made us look very good.

I would suggest that in the future that we open an entry in Lotus Notes when we are reviewing counterparty incoming guaranties so we have a record of them.

As a note, the three guaranties Rob is VERY interested in are:  NYSEG Solutions (already being worked on in Legal per Credit), Energetix and Keyspan Corp. (Credit is not sure).

Thanks for your kind consideration!

Please be advised that we are also sending this to legal.  Although this is a draft, the final form that legal approves will probably be very different.

Subject:	Requested Changes

Tidewater Fibre has requested some changes on the contract.  They are as follows:

1) Under Terms and Conditions, want to provide financial statements annually vs. monthly.

2) Alternative Floating Price Structure:  We have included RISI as the back-up index should the OBM become discontinued.  Because their is a basis difference between RISI and OBM, we need to adjust the alternative floating price as RISI - $18.  RISI - $18 would replace DLK East - $10.  Thus there is an $8 difference between the two indices.

3) Under Annex B1, the would like for it to read ""either party (ENA or Tidewater Fibre) faces default situation"" instead of Tidwater Fibre Corporation

4) Under the collateral provision, instead of counterparty they would like ""Tidewater Fibre and ENA""

If you would like to speak directly with the counterparty, I can arrange that.

Thanks

Erik

  I have your fruit - we probably need to meet somewhere to do the transfer.  There are too many boxes to carry.  I gave Jane her fruit last Friday and we met in the parking lot on Dallas - across from the Allen Center Met Parking Garage.  I'll send you an invoice.

  I am not sure if the decorative center is open today - if so, do you want to go?

Dear Dog Loving Friends,

We hope this letter finds its way to you - and to your hearts. Like the rest
of the nation, we've watched the events unfolding in NYC and Washington, DC
with disbelief, with horror, with sorrow.

Unfortunately, so often during a crisis, our loved pets can be forgotten or
unintentionally left to fend for themselves. Can you help us help them?

We are getting supplies of food, treats and dog boots for the rescue dogs
who need nourishment and protection for their paws while they work. The
rubble and steel can destroy and infect the pads of a dog's paw, rendering
them useless in their rescue work. The search dogs are working so hard to
locate and save human lives that they are wearing through their boots at a
rapid pace. We want to be sure they are protected.

Supplies of food and treats will also be donated to displaced dogs and other
pets whose owners cannot be there to care for them.

Please help. Mail your checks to:

The Gracie Foundation
1627 Main St., 7th Fl.
Kansas City, MO 64108

Or donate by credit card by calling 1-888-535-DOGS (3647) or 1-800-4-TREATS
(487-3287) Monday thru Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST.

Thank you in advance for any help whatsoever. No gift is too small. God
bless you and God bless our great country.

Dan and Mark
Founders of Three Dog Bakery

	Dear Marie:

	I apologies for not responding in a timely fashion- I was out out of
the office for a few days last week

	I attach a sample form of corporate resolutions which Bear Stearns
typically requires in connection with accepting a guarantee of an account.
You may also want to talk to Clement Abrams of your office who provided
similar documentation in connection with an original guarantee.  I would
appreciate it if you could draft a notice of termination of the original
guarantee and I will get it signed for you.


 	Thanks and regards,

      Anna Meytina

Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:

(1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?

(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set
up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit
goup to react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

1.   Replace Paragraph 1 with:



     This Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement (this ""Agreement"")
     is made and entered into effective as of November [   ], 2001 by and
     among BNP Paribas (including all branches and agencies thereof,
     ""BNPP""), BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. (""PFI"") and BNP Paribas
     Commodity Futures Limited (""BNPPCML""), and Enron Corp. (""Enron""),
     Enron North America Corp. (""ENA""), Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
     (""EPMI""), Enron Risk Management and Trading International Corp.
     (""ERMTIC""), Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
     (""ECTRIC""), Enron Credit Limited (""ECL""), Enron Metals Limited (""EML"")
     and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited (""ECTD"").



2.   Change definition of BNPP Party to ""means each of BNPP, PFI and
BNPPCML.""

3.   Change definition of Enron Party to "" means each of Enron, ENA, EPMI,
ECTRIC, ERMTIC, ECL, EML and ECTD.""

4.   In the definition of Transaction, insert before the word ""between""
""(i)"" and add at the end the following:

     or (ii) held at a contract market, exchange, board of trade or
     clearing organization by any Party on behalf of a member of the other
     Group pursuant to an Underlying Master Agreement.

5.   In Section 2(b), in (i), replace the phrase ""all Transactions under
one or more Underlying Master Agreements"" with ""each Transaction"".

6.   In Section 2(b), at the end of (ii) and (v) before the semi-colon,
insert the following:

     , under any other agreement or under applicable law or equity, whether
     in respect of the Transactions thereunder, or otherwise

7.   In Section 2(b), at the end of (iii), after ""applicable law"", insert
""or equity""

8.   In Section 4, in the third sentence, after the words ""from whom such
payment is due"" insert the following:

     to such Party or Parties as the Non-defaulting Group determines are
     entitled to such payment

9.   In Section 7(b), in each of the forth and the twelfth lines between
the words ""hereby"" and ""grants"", insert ""except as provided in the next
sentence"" and in each of the ninth and the sixteenth lines replace the text
beginning ""Obligations, "" until the end of each sentence with:

     Obligations.  Without limiting the rights referred to in Section 5,
     the security interest granted in the immediately preceding sentence
     shall not apply to the Final Settlement Amount.

10.   At the beginning of Sections 7(c) and 7(e), insert the words ""Subject
to Section 3,"".

11.   In Section 15(b), following the words ""on the basis of a payment
owed"", insert the words ""(including margin)"".

12.   With respect to Section 17, our client has indicated that it would
not be useful or efficient to have the issue of arbitration (which is
clearly not central to the risk reducing purposes of the arrangements)
mixed up with the proposed agreement, which has arisen from the
circumstances of Enron that have developed over the last few months.  BNP
Paribas' primary reason for not wanting to include an arbitration clause
(even with the suggested language changes) is that, although the concept of
arbitration is being considered generally, BNP Paribas has, of yet, not
made any definitive decisions as to the implicit or necessary value of
arbitration clauses and such a decision would require significant internal
review and discussion.  Over the next few months, further consideration can
be given as to including arbitration in this agreement.

13.  Please note that BNP Paribas contemplates at least one long-form
confirmation as an Underlying Master Agreement.

Please see Tom Doukas's request below.  Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in favor of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. et al dated March 29, 2001, with a $25,000,000 cap.  This guaranty secured obligations of Enron Credit, Inc. in connection with a Securities Loan Agreement and brokerage agreement.  The cap was increased to $100,000,000 by amendment dated May 15, 2001.  Are you okay with adding ECT Europe Finance, Inc. as an additional guaranteed party?

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

I had my first know down drag out with our friend CLH.  We closed a Qwest deal last week (Monday 7:00 am, of course she was here all weekend working on it).  Anyway, everyone was needing copies of the closing documents and they were all over me for them.  So on Wednesday mid morning I went into her office and had Tim make copies.  She came back from a meeting and as she was passing by I mentioned it to her and she lost it - Big Time! Everyone wanted to hide, I motioned for her to go into her office because she was making a scene and I shut the door.  She kept going on and on and said that I should have went and got her out of her meeting (yeah right) instead of taking them off of her desk and to never ever take anything off of her desk again. What a piece of work!

Hi Marie,

The fee letter looks good - and I have all of the paperwork here, except of
course the Termination letter for ENA Deal #0619, which you indicated the
Confirmation Desk was workin on.  So things look good to go.

I have the paperwork back from both Dynegy and Sempra, but United Oil's
letters is being reviewed by its lawyer today.  He was away for the past two
days.  As soon as I have everything together I will courier the complete
package to you - one detail that I forgot to mention - right now I have fax
copies only, and I hope it will suffice until I can get original signatures.
If it does not, then we are in real trouble!!  So say it is okay - and I
will work on the originals after the deal is completed.

Thanks for all your help, Marie.

It would be fine to stick with the standard guaranty wording. We will sort something out with them here regarding a process to review of the value of the guaranty.

Subject:	Enron Corp Guarantee for Optus contract

Marie,

We're down to the last item on signing a contract with Optus which would allow us to buy capacity from them in order to fill the circuit we sold to Uecomm (associated w/ the MSA).  They've requested a US$5 million parent guarantee from Enron Corp.  I don't know if this is standard, but they would like us to include some language that says we could review the amount in the future if needed.  But don't worry about this if it would slow things down.

Could you please arrange for a guarantee from Enron Corp?  How long does it take?  would it be possible to do it today (Wednesday)?  If we can get the guarantee and the contract executed by Thursday, Optus will have the circuit ready on Friday -- which is when our Customer needs it.

If you need any clarification, please feel free to call David Minns or me at any time.  My home number is 011-61-2-9360-1920.

Thanks

Pat

Any one of:

Mark Frevert

John Sherriff

Rick Buy
Rick Carson

Since we don't know the ins and outs as to why we are opening this account for this entity, Sara suggested that you or someone in your shop contact one of the officers from each group to explain the account and ask them to sign the documents.

Once you have determined who will sign, let me know and I'll take care of routing them for signature and getting them to Bear Stearns.

There shouldn't be a legal reason why we can't do this, however, we will need copies of all the Enron Corp. guaranties (and any amendments thereto), together with details of all contracts that will be covered.  Also, has Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. provided any incoming guaranties and, if so, do we want to consolidate those?

Subject:	ONEOK Gty

Legal Team--

ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. would like to replace the current Gty's that Enron has issued to them and receive one overall gty to cover the financial and physical business with ENA, ECC, ENA Upstream Company, LLC, EPMI, EES and EGLI.  This would include the trading executed under the ISDA, GISB, and GTC's.  In executing this new gty, we would simultaneously cancel the existing outgoing Gty's that we have out to them already.  The cap amount on this new Gty would be $75MM.

Can you please advise whether this is acceptable or not so that I can tell the counterparty--we're currently avoiding posting cash on a Margin call as ONEOK will accept a higher Gty amount to cover their exposure.

Thanks,

Veronica

I had my first know down drag out with our friend CLH.  We closed a Qwest deal last week (Monday 7:00 am, of course she was here all weekend working on it).  Anyway, everyone was needing copies of the closing documents and they were all over me for them.  So on Wednesday mid morning I went into her office and had Tim make copies.  She came back from a meeting and as she was passing by I mentioned it to her and she lost it - Big Time! Everyone wanted to hide, I motioned for her to go into her office because she was making a scene and I shut the door.  She kept going on and on and said that I should have went and got her out of her meeting (yeah right) instead of taking them off of her desk and to never ever take anything off of her desk again. What a piece of work!
