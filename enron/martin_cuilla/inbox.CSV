"Radical Shift in Western Power and Gas Market Dynamics - CERA Monthly Briefing","
Title: The West Enters a Bust 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2810;


***********************************************************************

RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS

The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000 
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's 
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to 
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the 
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure 
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the 
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power 
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.

*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in 
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving 
reliability.

*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter; 
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998. 

*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and 
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West 
Coast differentials.

"[Footballguys] Update # 194 1-1  Week 17 Passing Matchups","/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Wall of Champs Is Up!   Some sites attempt to impress you with titles won by
the guys running the site.   I've found most people are just slightly more
interested in winning THEIR own league.   Footballguys.com is built on the
concept of giving YOU information to win YOUR league and tons of you have
done just that.

If you've made your playoffs or won your league, let the world know about
it.   We've got our Wall of Champs up and running and waiting for you.
Check it out here  http://footballguys.com/wall2001.cfm You can add your
team here http://footballguys.com/addwall.cfm   There's not much better than
flaunting your success in front of your league members...

Enjoy.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Joe

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

What a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell
Stewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those
yards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be
involved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -
maybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although
you have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Check the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a
good matchup.


Denver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Griese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him
to do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do
well too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Manning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday
but he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go
to guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great
effort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos
rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Mike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the
playoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and
maybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than
a full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as
Holt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #
26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed
to WRs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Carolina Passing Game vs New England Defense


Can't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.
Weinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd
possibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin
Muhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.
For the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn
't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to
take advantage of the matchup though.


Chicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

When you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the
passing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the
Bears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes
than any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he
's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Quincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway
deep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for
sure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends
on whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more
thing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000
yard season so that may be a factor.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Trent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.
Tony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He
saw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.
The Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense


Jay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.
Chris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis
Minor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be
used more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Tom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams
going drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to
make an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.



Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Hindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated
player in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a
Superbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks
season (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another
shot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell
Jackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look
hard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Jeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last
week.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.
J.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.
The Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Elvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with
205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of
Qadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The
Vikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

Favre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it
was really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.
Freeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw
a handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this
week ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Aaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and
just 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading
receiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came
up small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Stewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4
Interceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is
showing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.
The Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Steve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a
totally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's
re-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal
number of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense
ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense


Tony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it
was the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle
injury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This
week, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking
# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed
to WRs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense


Mike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly
looking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler
was consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,
Shawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.
The Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

For the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up
Tennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of
choice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Mark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.
Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos
in the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats
don't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been
stingy allowing FF points.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Spergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.
Really puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'
re sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.
Both these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I
still think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so
even though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put
forth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Kerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki
Barber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing
pretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Vinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all
about Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders
rank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Rich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did
have the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well
and Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a
must win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Donovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week
and better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300
yards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back
onto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Brad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90
yards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.
Keyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This
week, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Start David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits
consideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.
The Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a
sure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense


Van Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks
to me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and
Peerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins
rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Mike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.
Sounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.
He threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger
were especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank
# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.

"Falling Gas Prices Trigger Active Rig Count Decline - CERA Decision Brief","
Title: Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2808;


***********************************************************************

FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINE

The economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling 
gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices 
briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068 
gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by 
November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers' drilling plans for the 
2002 budget year are already being curtailed.
 
*  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the 
United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day 
of lost production.

*  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop 
in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive 
capacity.
 
*  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy 
recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.

"Hi","I've thought about you a few times in the last few months, didn't want
to intrude upon an already bad situation with my bullshit questions.
I'm hearing some pretty depressing stuff from the people I know at ENE.
 
I wish I had the capital to open my own shop.there will be talent and
opportunity a plenty on the market soon.  I'll ask around.I've got some
friends at Duke and Dynegy from B-school, the Gianoucous (spelling??)
brothers (John and Dimitri.from elementary school) started their own
outfit a while back, and my old man is at Schlumberger and has good
contacts in general (if you aren't married to a trading environment).
 
Give me a few days, and I'll be in touch.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Mark:
I am starting to make my way through the Consumers balances and I have some February issues that I thought you may be able to help me with.  We have sale deal 618840 which is for Consumers contract 5040-82-42.  It looks like the deal is priced correctly, but Consumers also invoiced us for a demand fee that we don't have.  It was for 500,00 at $0.0175.  They show it as a take or pay deal.  Do you have this confirmation or can you tell me if we have this deal booked right?  I also have several other deals that look like receivables for Enron, but they've never been paid.  They are 244662, 636507, 636515 and 387756.   Should we have billed Consumers?  I don't have any Consumers the confirms for Feb, so I can't check the deals.

Justin,

This is Garrett on the Ontario Power Desk.  I will be in the Houston office spending time with the East Power Desk next week.  Let's set up a time for you to run through your Ontario Gas burn model.  Farouk and I do not need a great deal of specific information,  just enough to identify when Lennox is burning gas, and approximately how much.  Monday and Tuesday afternoon are good times for me, reply when you are available.

"NEB Approves TCPL Settlement","  The National Energy Board has approved the TCPL 2001-2002 Settlement agreement in its entirety.  The link to the Reasons for Decision (RH-1-2001)is attached below.

Highlights
- No change to current tolls pending final decision on Fair Return Hearing expected in late spring or summer, say June or July 2002
- AOS and FT Makeup Credits to IT Service to start effective Jan 1/02.
- IT Floor floats monthly between 80-120% of FT depending on AECO MI and seasonal marginal fuel rate (at current prices expected to remain at 80%)
- NEB expected to review Settlement Guidelines in near future (potentially opening door in future to FERC style negotiated tolls)

Dianne Ripley (403-974-6913) is responsible for implementing AOS and FT Makeup for Enron Canada.  She and I can both answer questions about how it works.

"Natural Gas--No Help from Demand: Difficult Time in the North American Gas Market  - CERA Watch","
Title: Quarterly Natural Gas Watch: A Shortage of Demand 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2789;


***********************************************************************

NO HELP FROM DEMAND: DIFFICULT TIME IN THE NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET

Since January, natural gas prices have fluctuated between $2.00 per MMBtu at 
the Henry Hub and $10.00, a result of weather, fuel switching, and increasing 
supplies. Loss of demand due to economic weakness is exacerbated by the impact 
of the tragedy of September 11. Lower prices have already slowed drilling 
activity. Although ample storage levels will guard against last year's peaks, 
gas prices will likely to continue to oscillate in the near term.  

* The US gas supply rebound expected after record drilling rates is now 
unlikely. CERA expects only modest production increases for 2001 and a year-
over-year decline for 2002.

* CERA has analyzed two paths for demand recovery depending on the severity and 
length of the economic downturn. Generally, the large overbuild of gas-fired 
generating plants and the recovery of industrial demand should cause much of 
the lost demand to return in 2002.

"A Small Step for Spain, but an Imporant Step for Europe - CERA Insight","
Title: The Spanish Gas Auction: A Precedent for Europe? 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2811;


***********************************************************************

A SMALL STEP FOR SPAIN, BUT AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR EUROPE

The recent auction of contract gas in Spain represents an early initiative both 
to release gas from preexisting long-term contracts and to make it available to 
aspiring market entrants. As such, CERA believes it could provide a precedent 
for other European markets (and for their regulators) where release gas 
programs have not so far been on the public agenda. 

*  The Spanish gas release program, as currently devised, will have limited 
impact on domestic competition. However, pressure will grow in Spain to extend 
the program.

*  By setting a unique precedent across Continental Europe, Spain has signaled 
a possible path for the reforms needed on the supply-side to complete the 
European gas internal market.

*  The role of credit risk and sovereign guarantees will be critical in any 
reallocation or renegotiation of long-term contracts.

"Retail Energy: Market Launch in January Could Make or Break Movement Toward Retail Competition - CERA Private Report","
Title: Lone Star: The Texas Market Launch Is a Pivotal Point for Retail Energy Competition 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2764;


***********************************************************************

MARKET LAUNCH IN JANUARY 2002 COULD MAKE OR BREAK THE MOVEMENT TOWARD RETAIL 
COMPETITION

The much-anticipated opening of the Texas market--one of the largest in the 
country--is on track for January 1, 2002. There are great expectations that 
this comprehensive and unique restructuring model, combined with favorable 
market conditions, will produce a viable retail market. As a result, Texas 
could be the lone star in what has been otherwise a largely disappointing 
market space.

* Market fundamentals should support retail competition as Texas moves into a 
supply surplus, providing an opportunity for competitive suppliers to earn a 
margin.

* Large customer load will switch to competitive suppliers well ahead of small 
customer load.

* Regardless of its success, the Texas retail market will have significant 
short-term and long-term effects on retail markets nationwide.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Mom","Well, it's over.  My mom passed away last night at 12:30 after a year long 
battle with pancreatic cancer.  I was in Texas with her for the past 5 days 
taking care of her and spending time with her.  The funeral should be 
Thursday in Texas and then the burial will be in Oklahoma on Saturday.  
Thank you all so much for your prayers, your support, sending Mom cards, 
driving me to the airport and doing whatever you could do for my family and 
me.  I couldn't have been so strong throughout this year if it weren't for 
the wonderful support of my friends.  I love you all.

"[Footballguys] Update # 163 11-26  Week 12 Upgrade - Downgrade","Hi Folks,

Once again, our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this
week's Upgrades and Downgrades.

Enjoy.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Tom Brady - Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the
return of Drew Bledsoe from injury.  Some analysts may question the fact
that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's
effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance
keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots
have a bye in week 16.

QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second
consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254
passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks
good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and
Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris
Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his
upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season
should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers
this weekend.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes
has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with
147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against
Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season
is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look
for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes.

RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with
153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith
away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season
will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining.

RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to
bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for
the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the
season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will
become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the
talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the
remainder of the season.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's statistics have suffered over the
last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run.  In order to get
the ball in Tomlinson's hands more often, Turner called several short
passing plays to get LT in the open field.  The plan was successful as
Tomlinson caught 13 passes for 72 yards.  The fantasy playoffs look good for
Tomlinson with Oakland, Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks
14, 15, and 16.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing
yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106
rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on
Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see
20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs
as long as he remains healthy.

WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he
is 100% healthy for the first time this season.

WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the
lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well,
the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What
happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2
touchdowns).

WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with
101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play
threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in
mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week
and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him
in dynasty leagues.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock
on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks
should quiet the critics.

WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday
with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1
receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the
season.

WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent
basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown
continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New
England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the
majority of championship games.  Plan accordingly.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades

QB - Trent Green - Green's disappointing season continues.  He looked good
with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was
unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With
the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver, Green's stock could be on
the rise in the near future.  Green's value is at its lowest point, so you
could probably get him for relatively cheap.  He's not an every week
starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season.

QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the
last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to
be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production.
McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some
plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy
quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will
drop quickly.

QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is
directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game
with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock.
However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver
position.  His production is limited, if he is forced to throw to the tight
end position the majority of the time.

QB - Daunte Culpepper - Culpepper did not pass/score a touchdown for the
first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings.
Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring
injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is
not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me
to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy
hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two
weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that
game.

RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the
Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game,
Smith's numbers will remain meager.

RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option
in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had
26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5
receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench.

RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the
Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone
else to the roster.

RB - Eddie George - George's disappointing season continues with 58 yards on
15 carries this past Sunday.  George is currently tied with Randy Moss for
""Fantasy Disappointment of the Year"".

RB - Maurice Smith - Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to
return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries
and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later
this week.

WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after
being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of
suspension could be handed down by the commissioner's office.  Not a good
sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs.

WR - Peter Warrick - Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland
on Sunday. He was held to 1 reception for 22 yards and has not scored a
touchdown since week 4 of the season.  Keep him on your bench until the
Cincinnati passing game reappears.

WR - Randy Moss - Moss was held to 25 yards on 4 catches Sunday night.  Moss
is the most talented receiver in the league, but appears to lose
concentration from time to time.  Keep in mind, his potential for explosive
games is enormous.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire

Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.

RB - James Allen - Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and
performed admirably.  With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury, it's
highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this
weekend.  Chicago's defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on
the ground.

RB - Travis Minor - With Lamar Smith averaging just 2.3 yds/carry over the
last 6 games, Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon.  In his
limited touches, Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a
much needed spark.

WR - Chris Chambers - This guy is good.  See description in upgrades
section.

TE - Eddie ""Boo"" Williams - I had Williams on the list last week and his
play on Sunday deserves another mention.  Although he had just 2 catches for
44 yards, Williams has explosive potential.  He nearly scored on a 25 yard
pass play, but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second.
With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury, Williams is a tight end with
quality upside.

***********************************************************************

Dear Mexico Gas and Power Client,

As you might be aware, Pemex is proposing a new type of service contract as a 
way to increase E&P investment in nonassociated gas in the Burgos basin. 
Originally, CERA was planning to have a luncheon in December to discuss the 
current status of these integrated contracts. Our intention was to invite key 
individuals from Pemex to discuss the proposed contracts with our clients. 
Pemex has informed us, however, that they are unable to discuss the service 
contracts with the private sector prior to their formal announcement of the 
service contract structure. Until this constraint has been resolved, CERA has 
decided to have a conference call detailed below. We look forward to your 
participation. 

Regards,  

Mexico Gas and Power

**************************************************************************

TOPICS

*  Overview of proposed service contract structure

*  Assessing the attractiveness of the contracts

*  Expectations of future investment under proposed structure

FORMAT

Our speakers will address this topic for 30 minutes, with accompanying graphics 
presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer period.

Speakers
*  Sondra Scott, CERA Director, Latin America

Time:

3:00 P.M. Eastern Time, Wednesday, December 5, 2001.

Clients eligible to participate in this conference call are those who subscribe 
to the CERA Mexico Gas and Power and Latin America Upstream Retainer Advisory

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count. 
Please call Shirley Crenshaw at 3-5290 to register.

"Western Energy--Winter Demand Peaks Not Expected to Result in Price Spikes or Reliability Problems - CERA Monthly Briefing","
Title: One Tight Winter Peak Remains 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2760;


***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--WINTER DEMAND PEAKS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PRICE SPIKES OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS

Building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western 
energy markets for this winter. Although seasonal gas and power demand spikes 
will again push prices higher, this winter will not look like the winter of 
2000/01. Unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last 
year winter, reduced demand, increased gas storage levels, and new gas and 
power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the 
risk of supply disruptions. 

*  A supply build of 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the Rockies and 
900 MMcf in western Canada is meeting with declining demand in the West

*  Fourth quarter power demand is expected to be 13 percent below levels last 
year, while over 5,000 megawatts of new supply has been added this year

*  Only severe cold weather, prolonged drought, or a supply disruption could 
produce a reliability problem this winter

Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for this final week 17.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Minnesota Defense

Terry Allen ran hard last week where he rushed 20 times for 74 yards (3.3
ypc) against a tough Buc team.   It'll be much easier this week against the
swiss cheese Vikings ranked # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   Although, these Vikings did shut down Ahman Green last week.
For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Denver's Terrell Davis vs Indianapolis Defense

Terrell Davis looked good again rushing for 89 yards on 18 carries (4.9 ypc)
It's been a tough year and you can bet he'll want to finish strong.   The
Colts rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs Carolina Defense

A rested Antowain Smith faces the soft Carolina defense that's ranked # 31
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Great matchup.


Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis vs Cleveland Defense

Fuamatu-Ma'afala was a workhorse on the ground Sunday but didn't have a lot
to show for it.   He ran 25 times for 55 yards (2.2 ypc)   He did score on a
receiving TD.   He'll face a weak Cleveland defense ranked # 29 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Arizona Defense

Stephen Davis looked great rushing for 111 yards on 21 carries (5.3 ypc) and
the score.   He left with a knee tweak but it doesn't look to be serious.
Ki-Jana Carter played great after Davis left.   The Cardinals rank # 21 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson / Travis Henry / Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense

Bryson ran wild again rushing 28 times for 107 yards (3.8 ypc).   Sammy
Morris spelled him for a few carries and looked good too but it seems Bryson
is clearly the man here.   It's possible Henry could see action so keep an
eye on this one through the week.   The Dolphins have fallen down to # 28 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Detroit Defense

Emmitt looked very solid again rushing for 126 yards on 26 carries (4.8 ypc)
although he failed to score.   He needs a little over 60 yards to get 1,000
for the season so you can bet he'll be gunning for that.   The Lions rank #
18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense

Barber saw more action with 16 carries and 71 yards (4.4 ypc) but it was
Dayne who scored with 59 yards on 8 carries (7.4 ypc)   Barber was very
active again in the passing game.   The Packers let Michael Bennett run well
Sunday and have slipped to # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Oakland Defense

Martin put in another Martin Like day with 115 yards on 19 carries (6.1 ypc)
The Jets may have problems, but Martin isn't one.   He'll face an Oakland
defense ranked # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Oakland's Charlie Garner vs New York Jets Defense

The Raiders don't look nearly as strong as they did.   Garner only had 9
carries Sunday for 23 yards (2.6 ypc)   Tyrone Wheatley only had 5 carries.
This week they've got a nice matchup as they'll face the Jets ranked # 26 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense

Alexander didn't do much Sunday rushing 23 times for 59 yards (2.6 ypc)   He
'll be ok though and gets to face a Chief defense ranked # 22 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense

Start Faulk.   The question will be of course how much he plays but it was
pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play.   Trung Canidate
could have really used the work but he warmed the bench while Faulk went
nuts.   I'd say you'll get at least a half, maybe much more out of Faulk and
half of Faulk is worth more than most backs.   The Falcons rank # 24 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Washington Defense

Just when it looked like Michael Pittman was going to take over the clear
cut # 1 RB role, Thomas Jones steps in with 16 carries.   Pittman rushed 12
times for 89 yards (7.4 ypc) which was bolstered by a 39 yarder.   Jones ran
for 69 yards on 16 carries (4.3 ypc)   This was Carolina, though.   This
week will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they've been pretty
soft though and rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense

Priest Holmes ran 27 times for 91 yards (3.4 ypc) plus the score.   Tony
Richardson didn't have a carry.   This week, he'll face the Seahawks ranked
# 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Miami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs Buffalo Defense

This is getting embarrassing.   Smith rushed 7 times for 4 yards (0.6 ypc)
Travis Minor had 33 yards on 9 carries (3.7 ypc)   He's becoming less and
less of a factor with each game.   The Dolphins are in the playoffs but find
themselves playing a different style of ball than they have been.   Minor's
a threat to go long on the screen passes and Smith is a long shot for a
cheap TD.   They'll face the Bills ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Baltimore Defense

We said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday rushing 25 times
for 104 yards (4.2 ypc)   He'll face a Baltimore defense that's numbers don'
t back up it's reputation this week - they rank # 25 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs San Francisco Defense

Even though he didn't score, it was a better performance by Williams who
rushed 17 times for 74 yards (4.4 ypc)   The Saints clearly want him to be
more involved as he was Sunday.   This week, he'll face a 49er defense
ranked # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 18
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs New Orleans Defense

Garrison Hearst was a non factor Sunday with just 35 yards on 11 carries
(3.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow didn't do much either so it wasn't like he lost
time to another player.   This week, he gets the Saints who rank # 15 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Philadelphia Defense

Tampa's One-Two punch continues to work.   Alstott had 80 yards on 14
carries (5.7 ypc) and Dunn carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards (3.6 ypc)
Alstott's been more effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more
involved in the passing game.   This week, they'll face an Eagle defense
ranked # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 9
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense

Dillon showed again he can run on any defense.   He had 91 yards on 21
carries (4.3 ypc) against the Steelers.   He'll face the Titans this week
ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks so it won
't get much easier.   They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Dallas Defense

The Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren
gaining 19 yards on 6 carries (3.2 ypc).   Cory Schlesinger did catch 11
passes though so maybe he's worth a longshot pick there.   The Cowboys rank
# 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 12 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense

Green was shut down on the ground with just 31 yards on 16 carries (1.9 ypc)
although he did score.   Go figure.   He's still too good to sit in my
opinion.   This week, he'll face the Giants ranked # 10 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it's a tough matchup, although I think I'd
start Green unless you really have a solid alternative.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense

Again, Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for 83 yards on 20 carries
(4.2 ypc) with a score.   He'll face the Broncos this week ranked # 7 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Broncos are definitely
surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense

Mack went off last week with 125 yards on 16 carries (7.8 ypc) and a score.
It'll be tougher this week against Chicago that ranks # 9 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense

Staley's receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he
paid the price.   He only rushed 8 times for 23 yards (2.9 ypc) and was shut
 down receiving with just 2 receptions for -1 yards.   This week, he'll face
a surging Buc defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense

Eddie George looked the old Eddie Sunday with 130 yards on 26 carries (5.0
ypc)   Plus 2 scores.  This week he'll face a Bengal defense ranked # 11 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs St. Louis Defense

Again, Maurice Smith ran poorly but got a cheap TD.   He managed just 38
yards on 15 carries (2.5 ypc).   Bob Christian stole 10 carries where he
gained 33 yards (3.3 ypc)   They're both a gamble against a tough Ram
defense ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs New England Defense

Huntley ran pretty well last week gaining 62 yards on 12 carries (5.2 ypc).
He just didn't get enough carries for this awful Carolina team.   That won't
get any better this week agains the Patriots ranked # 2 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Jacksonville Defense

Thomas ran 25 times for 76 yards (3.0 ypc) Sunday.   He'll face a tougher
defense in Jacksonville that's been awesome lately ranking # 1 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Thomas is still probably a starter in
most leagues, but the Jaguars have been extremely stingy of late.


Cleveland's Jamel White vs Pittsburgh Defense

White only had 42 yards on 21 carries (2.0 ypc) but did score twice.   Corey
Dillon showed the Steeler defense wasn't perfect last week.  They're still
tough though ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
