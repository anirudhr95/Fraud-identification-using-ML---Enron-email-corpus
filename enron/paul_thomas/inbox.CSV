Subject:	RE: Update following our meeting re. VEPCO

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

On the VEPCO contract we also need to consider the damages for failure to deliver scheduled energy.  Yesterday we talked about normal LDs.  This likely will not work if we are basing the VEPCO price on an hourly index since VEPCO's cost of cover would likely be close to hourly prices.

 Under the current contract, if we fail to deliver, EPMI is obligated to pay:

1.  Cost of Cover defined as either (a) (1) actual cost of incremental purchase or generation costs or if VEPCO is unable to make up the delivery obligations, then (2) VEPCO's highest cost source of generation minus (b) offered energy price (hourly index price under new proposal) Section 9.2); plus either

(A)  If VEPCO has designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of annual capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $530,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) (Section 9.3); or 

(B) If VEPCO has not designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of daily capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $42,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) Section 9.5); 

Let's think about what we should propose (eg 150% of index hourly price per hour of non-delivery?)


Thanks

Importance:	High

Everyone,

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP"" (the ""Index""). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

"RE: Data Problems","Paul, 
I don't doubt that the PJM summary has improved, as I have been pulling the data directly from edata instead of using the website.  I will begin to record the difference and will talk with the web data folks in an attempt to understand where they are pulling the data.

I have been using the updated website.

I spot checked the Zone P prices and there were few errors of little consequence.

As for the NE physical, I was doing some analysis and unless I have my directions backwards 24to6 has been a pretty solid play. On the DAP to DAW and DAP to RTW.  DA to RT has even been a pretty decent play during other hours.  From the night shift I can't tell if this is not being scheduled because you are busy managing EOL products or if there is some reason I don't have the experience to understand yet.

I know this is your book and you will want to keep the earnings.  I just noticed the opportunity appears to be there.  If you would like we can do some of the analysis and pass it on to you to place the orders.  Another idea might be for you to tell us what you want to do in NY and you can decide what to do with it on the day shift.

I do not want to step on your turf.  At the same time,"" the times they are a changin'""  You have done well with the books you have and as people come and go it is easy to see a scenario where you will be trading more during the day.  As you move to use the NE physical book more for hedging, as Gautam has used it.  There may be a role for the 24 hour guys to take on more of the speculative portion of the physical market. It would seem to make sense to at least start getting the other guys thinking about that portion of the market by trying any of the ideas in the previous paragraph.

It is kind of hard to talk about this over email, I would like to find a time to discuss it. 

Thanks
David

David,

Diana Allen and the IT team are currently working on resovling the bad Zone P day ahead and real time data.  Diana told me that it was pulling the PJM data.  

As far as the shift notes go:
I talked to Rob Benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly.  The PJM summary page is pretty accurate (usually w/in 50 cents of the actual number).  The link for the spreadsheet is:  http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/summary/pjmsummary.aspx  .. you might have been using an old version.  

I will continue to manage the Northeast physical book.  It allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market. 

Paul.

While writing the e-mail Diana said that she fixed the Zone P problem.

Subject:	Data Problems

Paul,
I have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at.

1.  The number Mother data is pulling for Zone P is wrong.  The pointer for the data can be found on the SQL worksheet the expression is:
	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'DAYAHEAD', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_DA,
and	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'HOURLY', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_RT,

I have looked at the PJM and NY prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from.

2.  The other 24hr desk evidently has been told that the PJM night shift is to prep the PJM and Nepool portions of the shift notes.  That is fine with me.  I wrote a macro to pull, format and print the Nepool information.  The PJM information is not available on the website.  The East power portal has something.  I think it does some kind of Op Sum pull at some unknown interval.  The problem is the information is not accurate.  

Rob Bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other 24hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting.

2.a All data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata.  This makes me doubt that opsum is the source, as edata also pulls from opsum.

2.b When all interfaces and hubs are printing the same, the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website.  I have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right.  If the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at ""M:\Electric\24hour\PJM AVE\PJMSummary.exe"".  If they could fix this app I would care less about the web site.  If they do not want to fix the app I can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template.  I don't really care how I get the data, I just need to get yesterday's PJM for the shift note.

In other news, if you are trading some of the regular products, are you following the DA-RT physical moves?  If we do man the 24hr desk (even if Bryce is the day guy) we could cover the DA-RT physical.  Having it part of the 24hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the NY side in the early morning.

I only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading PJM to spend the same amount of time on the analysis.  It is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift.  Just a thought.

Thanks,
David

"Re: Virtual Bidding Course","
Paul,

As we discussed in our recent phone call, my recommendation is to attend
the course, because the level of detail will be far greater than we in the
Customer Relations department can provide. I have tentatively reserved a
conference room at the Power Control Center for 4 pm, on Oct. 15th if you
are able to make it. I've also invited  F. Francis to join us. Please let
me know if you will be able to meet at 4pm, or some later time.

Also, I spoke with Juan Padron this morning and firmed-up our plans for
Frank and I to visit you in Houston on the 10/22. We will plan to be in
Houston for whatever hours are convenient to meet with you and Juan on that
day. I suggested to Juan that if there are any issues that you would like
us to address during the visit, just let us know ahead of time so that we
may prepare.

Thanks,
Dave

Dave,

I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I
was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and
Frank are coming to Houston the next week.  Basically, do you think that
you can give us the same information that the course would while you are
here?  Please let me know.

The five remaining rounds of the Initial Autumn 2001 TCC Auction for
Six-Month TCCs will be conducted with the Rockland Electric Company portion
of Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc. represented as external to the New
York Control Area (NYCA).  This will reduce the load in Zone G (Hudson
Valley) PTID 61758 by approximately 20 percent.  No individual generator
PTIDs are affected by this change.

"November 1999 Settlement Adjustment Invoices","The invoices for November 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by
23:00 today, Monday, September 17, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes for any
inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.

Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to:
(1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing
process;  and  (2)  adjust  the  NYISO clearing account balance to zero for
November 1999 settlements.

With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these
adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant
data fix.  As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments
is  done  through  adjustments  outside  of the billing process.  The total
adjustment of $14,178.39 was allocated across 5,059,790 MWh.  Customers may
validate  their  respective  adjustments by computing their ratio shares of
the  $14,178.39  using 5,059,790 MWh as the denominator in their respective
ratios of their November 1999 load.  Customers will observe a difference in
the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment
versus  adjustment  #2.   This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for
adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the
adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.

Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of
forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred
by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an
adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.   This  billing treatment for the
November  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market
totaling  $5,583,559.78  allocated  across  5,074,229 MWh.  Customers where
allocated  their  portion  of  this  adjustment based upon their respective
ratio  shares of the 5,074,229 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for
the month.

November  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to
address  the  delay  in  invoicing.  Payments due to the NYISO for November
1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing
account on Monday, September 24, 2001.  Payments due to market participants
will  be  made  on  Thursday,  September  27,  2001.   Please  refer to the
attachment below for banking instructions.

The  NYISO anticipates that the 2nd settlement adjustment for December 1999
settlements  will  be  invoiced tomorrow, Tuesday, September 2001 by 23:00.
Settlements  dates will be adjusted to accomodate the invoice date changes.
Given  the aforementioned schedules, payments due to the NYISO for December
1999  settlement  adjustments  will  be  due  to  be  received in the NYISO
clearing  account  on  Tuesday, September 25, 2001.  Payments due to market
participants  will  be  made on Friday, September 28, 2001.  The NYISO will
confirm the invoicing schedule for December 1999 settlements tomorrow.

Randy A. Bowers

Dear Friends & Family,

Happy Thanksgiving!  We hope that all of you are able to spend quality time
with your loved ones over the long holiday weekend.

Sophie and I would like to inform you that we have recently moved to New
Orleans, Louisiana (NOLA), as of Labor Day weekend.  As many of you know,
our recent transition is a result of Sophie's admission into the Tulane

NOLA is a familiar environment for both of us; it's where we met nearly
four years ago.  We are still maintaining a partial residence in Houston
and try to visit family & friends at least once a month.  I am still based
out of the Accenture Houston Office and currently work on a project in
Atlanta during the week.  Although we will be a little further away from
all of you, we very much look forward to your visits.  And we're especially
happy to announce that we'll be able to entertain you in our new loft
(unless, of course, Med School exams are going on).

Please feel free to update the following contact information and take note

"NYISO - Software Release - October 30, 2001","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The following software updates will become active on October 30, 2001.

The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the
implementation of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application
server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to provide
bidding and scheduling capability to Internet customers. The
new software replaces the NetDynamics product, will provide
the same functionality, and will be a more robust and reliable
development platform for future enhancements.

Enhancements will be made to the software that generates the
Pre-MGF (Master Generator File) file used by transmission owners
in the event of a Backup Dispatch System (BDS) activation. The
enhancements will ensure more accurate operation of the BDS system.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information.

Multiple preliminary software changes will be made to the MIS,
SPIDER, and BAS systems in preparation for the activation of
Virtual Bidding in the NYISO energy markets on November 1, 2001.
Activation of Virtual Bidding is pending approval by the FERC.


If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Subject:	FW: Men's Rights



     1.  How many men does it take to open a can of beer?
     None.  It should be opened by the time she brings it.

     2.  Why is a Laundromat a really bad place to pick up a woman?
     Because a woman who can't even afford a washing machine will probably
     never be able to support you.

     3.  Why do women have smaller feet than a man?
     It's one of those ""evolutionary things"" that allows them to stand
     closer to the kitchen sink.

     4.  How do you know when a woman is about to say something smart?
     When she starts a sentence with ""A man once told me.  .  .  ""

     5.  How do you fix a woman's watch?
     You don't.  There's a clock on the oven.

     6.  Why do men fart more than women?
     Because women can't shut up long enough to build up the required
     pressure.

     7.  If your dog is barking at the back door and your wife is yelling
     at the front door, who do you let in first?
     The dog, of course.  He'll shut up once you let him in.

     8.  What's worse than a male chauvinist Pig?
     A woman that won't do what she is told.

     9.  I married Miss Right.
     I just didn't know her first name was ""Always"".

     10.  I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months.
     I don't like to interrupt her.

     11.  What do you call a woman who has lost 95% of her intelligence?
     Divorced.

     12.  Scientists have discovered a food that diminishes a woman's sex
     drive by 90%.
     It's called a wedding cake.

     13.  Marriage is a three ring circus.
     Engagement ring, Wedding ring, Suffering.

     14.  Our last fight was my fault. My wife asked,"" What was on the TV?""
     I said, ""Dust.""

     15.  Why do men die before women?
     They want to.

     16.  Young son,""Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of Africa,
     a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her?
     That happens in every country son.

     17.  A man inserted an advertisement in the classifieds: Wife Wanted.""
     The next =20 day he received a hundred letter.
     They all said the same thing: You can take mine.""

     18.  The most effective way to remember your wife's birthday is to
     forget it once.

     19.  Women will never be equal to men until they can walk down the
     street with a bald head and a beer gut, and still think they are
     beautiful.

     20.  Why do married men gain weight while bachelors don't?
     Bachelors go to the refrigerator, see nothing they want, then go to
     bed.
     Married guys go to bed, see nothing they want, then go to the
     refrigerator.

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board.""

"November & December 1999 Settlement Adjustments","
RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO is delaying issuance of the November & December 1999 - 2nd
Settlement Adjustments, scheduled for September 7th, by a week.  The delay
is necessary to make corrections to the re-engineered invoicing process
under which these settlements will be made.

Settlements for November 1999 through March 2000 were ""trued-up"" once under
a process that only adjusted settlements at the hourly interval level.
Upon realizing that the now superseded process was deficient in its ability
to ""true-up"" settlements at the SCD interval level, the process was
completely re-engineered and put into operation in February 2001.

In order to perform the 2nd settlement adjustments [a.k.a. true-ups] for
November through March under the new process, the 1st true-ups of these
months must be reversed to create the billing determinant measurement set
that was used in the 1st true-up.  The newly acquired billing determinants
for the 2nd settlement adjustments will then be netted against the set from
the 1st true-ups.  That delta will then become the amount invoiced for the
2nd settlement adjustment.

This delay is to fix mapping problems observed between the old measurement
set invoicing format and the new measurement set formats.  Invoices will be
issued once the mapping problems have been corrected and we am satisfied
that the settlements can be readily reconciled by our Market Participants.
The NYISO apologizes for this delay and any resultant problems.

Regards,
Randy A. Bowers
Manager - Customer Settlements

Security Level:?         Internal



Comprehending Engineers: Take One

Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said,
""Where did you get such a great bike?""

The second engineer replied, ""Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my
own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike. She threw the bike
to the ground, took off all her clothes, and said, ""Take what you want.""

The second engineer nodded approvingly, ""Good choice; the clothes probably
wouldn't have fit anyway.""


Comprehending Engineers: Take Two

To the optimist, the glass is half full, to the pessimist, the glass is
half-empty, to the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.


Comprehending Engineers: Take Three

A pastor, a doctor and an engineer were waiting one morning for a
particularly slow group of golfers.  The engineer fumed,  ""What's with these
guys?  We must have been waiting for 15 minutes!""

The doctor chimed in, ""I don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude!""
The pastor said, ""Hey, here comes the greens-keeper. Let's have a word with
him.""

""Hi George.  Say, what's with that group ahead of us?  They're rather slow,
aren't they?""

The greens-keeper replied, ""Oh, yes, that's a group of blind firefighters.
They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we
always let them play for free anytime.""

The group was silent for a moment.  The pastor said, ""That's so sad. I think
I will say a special prayer for them tonight.""

The doctor said, ""Good idea, and I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist
buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them.""

The engineer said, ""Why can't these guys play at night?""


Comprehending Engineers: Take Four

There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things
mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily
retired.

Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly
impossible problem they were having with one of their multimillion-dollar
machines.  They had tried every thing and everyone else to get the machine
to work but to no avail.  In desperation, they called on the retired
engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.  The engineer
reluctantly took the challenge.

He spent a day studying the huge machine.   At the end of the day, he marked
a small ""x"" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and stated,
""This is where your problem is.""

The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again.  The company
received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service.

They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.  The engineer responded
briefly:

        One chalk mark-----------------$1.00
        Knowing where to put it---$49,999.00

It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.


Comprehending Engineers: Take Five

What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil Engineers?
Mechanical Engineers build weapons.  Civil Engineers build targets.


Comprehending Engineers: Take Six

Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the possible
designers of the human body.  One said, ""It was a mechanical engineer.  Just
look at all the joints.""

Another said, ""No, it was an electrical engineer.  The nervous system has
many thousands of electrical connections.""

The last said, ""Actually it was a civil engineer.  Who else would run a
toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area?""


Comprehending Engineers: Take Seven

Normal people believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features
yet.""


Comprehending Engineers: Take Eight

An architect, an artist, and an engineer were discussing whether it was
better to spend time with the wife or a mistress.  The architect said he
enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid foundation for an enduring
relationship.

The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of the passion
and mystery he found there.

The engineer said, ""I like both.""

""Both?""

The Engineer said, ""Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each
assume you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the
office and get some work done""


Comprehending Engineers: Take Nine

An engineer was crossing a road one-day when a frog called out to him and
said, ""If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess.""

He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up
again and said, ""If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess,
I will stay with you for one week.""

The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and, returned it
to the pocket.

The frog then cried out,  ""If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess,
I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want.""

Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it, and put it back into his
pocket.  Finally, the frog asked, ""What is the matter? I've told you I'm a
beautiful princess, and that I'll stay with you for a week and do anything
you want.  Why won't you kiss me?""

The engineer said, ""Look I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a
girlfriend, but a talking frog...that's cool!""

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As many of you are likely aware, there is currently a computer virus named
Code Red Worm making its way around the internet. Through the congestion it
causes, this virus and its variants may significantly impact normal
internet functions. It is projected that a version of this virus is
scheduled to go from dormant to active state sometime this evening
(7/31/2001) and could create problems for anyone using the internet.

Because of the various functions handled over the internet between the New
York Independent System Operator (""NYISO"") and Market Participants, the
NYISO has done everything we can to secure our operations against problems
from this virus. Likewise, we strongly urge you to be sure that your
organization is up-to-date about this issue and that you take all possible
precautions to prevent any problems with your normal business functions.

Accordingly, we are providing three links to websites below that maintain
some of the most up-to-date and authoritative information we know of about
viruses such as these. If you have not already done so, we urge you to
visit one or more of these sites to familiarize yourself with the issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Subject: FW: Move Related Issues





As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?       Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?       Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.

o       Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees 

?       Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?       Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  

o       Red - Move Team 
o       Orange - Desktop Support/IT 
o       Green - Telephony 

?       Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?       Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?       Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?       Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.       Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?       Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01. 

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move. 

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes
Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation, in an Advisory
by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston): The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants, which
could represent part of the answer to world's power generation needs
over the next 30 years, has taken a few steps forward in the
consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months.
However, nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental
groups and those involved with post-Chernobyl public health concerns.
	   The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) from Eskom in South Africa
continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry
regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the
modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and
appropriate.
	   Stakeholders in the project include the U.S. company Exelon with
12.5%, Eskom with 30%, British Nuclear Fuels with 22.5%, Industrial
Development Corporation of SA with 25%, and Black empowerment at 10%.
Currently, Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of 40 PBMRs
at a price of around $6 billion (USD). Early in 2001 the company
requested the U.S. National Regulatory Commission to start laying the
groundwork for PBMR licensing.
	   Exelon would like to see the $300 million demonstration unit,
which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model, to show
that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety,
efficiency and viability are proven enough for U.S. regulatory
agencies to proceed forward with licensing. The plant is to be built
alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape
Province of South Africa with work commencing in 2003. If approved,
Exelon may then start concurrent construction of U.S. sites to bring
PBMR-generated power to market at the earliest possible date and at
the best price. Specifications and claims by Eskom, who purchased the
technology after a 21-year development and proving period in Germany,
present the PBMR as small, safe, clean, cost efficient, inexpensive
and adaptable.
	   The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in
graphite to form a fuel sphere (60mm in diameter). The PBMR design
makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a
closed cycle gas turbine and generator. The design differences between
the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a
safe and economical power plant.
	   The annual world market for power generation is estimated at $70
billion. The PBMR, if it comes through its regulatory trials, would be
in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action. With 10%
of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black
empowerment shareholders, 10 plant export orders a year could
contribute nearly $1 billion a year to South Africa's Gross Domestic
Product and another $1 billion in export income. An estimated 57,000
direct and indirect jobs would be created. These figures would double
and triple for 20 or 30 orders annually. If the demo plant achieves
its targets, Eskom will place an order for 10 modules, with the Exelon
order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the
first U.S. plant in 2007.
	   Eskom will sell PBMR's as a manufactured item with no rights
given. Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured
reactor and 20% site construction related. The aim is for 40% of the
sourcing to come from South Africa. Taxpayers money (approximately $50
million so far) is being spent by the South African authorities in
giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the
project before the ""go"" decision is given. With this right and proper
concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the
130MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of
nuclear power generation.
	   The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their
ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a
significant move. A contract has been placed (in mid-January 2002)
with the U.S. company Stone & Webster and South African construction
company Murray & Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman
Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project
in engineering, procurement, construction management and project
management. Following this development, the PBMR management at Eskom
have gone on record to state that with the multi-national and
multi-disciplinary support now providing leverage, the approval
hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of 2002
given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the
government.

I gave those to Irma just before we left for Christmas.  They did not have your stamp on them, as Ben had not turned them into you yet.  Irma said, however, that they could still be processed.

We currently do not have tuition for both Paul and Peter.  I did not notice that they are in the Ass/Ana grp.  You might want to check w/ Terry Bosien as her team had this process separate from us at one point.

Paul Thomas and Peter Makkai submitted tuition re-imbursement forms to Kim Melodick prior to bankruptcy approx Nov. 15.  I can not track down the actual paperwork and wanted to make sure that this was being processed.  Please confirm.

Dear NYISO Market Participants:

State. We've just posted the course on our web site at

the latest system updates, however, and rigorously covers all marketplace
topics.

The course will be conducted at the Hyatt Regency Houston, 1200 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas, from 8:30 am  Tuesday December 11 until 3:00 pm
Thursday December 13. If you're interested, we suggest you register early
as we expect a healthy turn-out. In order to get a realistic count, there
will be a $300 charge for no-shows, or for cancellations not made by 12:00
noon Monday, December 3.

Please call Customer Relations at (518) 356-6060, if you have any questions
regarding the course, or Debbie Doyle at (518) 356-6274 regarding

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

"Capacity Totals","
""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The results of the recent capacity auctions would seem to highlight that
New York and NYC in particular may not be the ""tight markets"" that
require the numerous layers of mitigation presently in place.

It is difficult to determine the ""spare"" capacity in NYC, Long Island or
the Rest of State market due the fact that New York unlike other ISOs
does not publish what the total capacity supply is for each month or
season. The ""curtailable load"" portion of the equation has had a
significant impact on capacity requirements but as yet it is unknown
what the total impact is. This new capacity supply is effectively
increasing the supply of available capacity.

Quoting generation capabilities and load requirements excludes
curtailable load and other demand response mechanisms, the exclusion of
these factors grossly misrepresents supply conditions.

Total capacity and spare capacity after the completion of all the
capacity auctions is information essential to the economics for
developers who are developing or constructing generation in NYC and
other areas in NY. There is only a set amount of capacity required in
New York and New York City, adjustments in price do not increase demand
as they would in other commodities.

Assumptions that supplies are tight and developers can rely on capacity
payments to contribute to fixed cost recovery are severely overstated.

There is a significant surplus of capacity in NYC alone, at a minimum
there is well over 800 MW of spare capacity that we can account for as a
result of the recent auctions.

How much more capacity is out there?

Market participants require this information to assess the economics to
develop and build new generation facilities. If capacity payments are
being included in project economics then this will have a significant
impact on the viability of projects if those capacity payments are not
there.
This information needs to be published.

"NYS Reliability Council Executive Committee","     The Executive Committee of the New York State Reliability Council
(""NYSRC"") is posting this message to inform all interested parties of the
approval and posting of Revision No. 2 to the NYSRC Reliability Rules.  The
NYSRC Executive Committee approved Revision No. 2 at its January 11, 2002
meeting.  Revision No. 2 to the NYSRC Reliability Rules, which is attached
below and is posted on the NYSRC web site at ""www.nysrc.org"" under the
""Documents"" web page, is a compilation of all current NYSRC Reliability
Rules and Measurements.  Included in the document are all of the Proposed
Reliability Rules that were posted for comments, in accordance with NYSRC
Policy No. 1, and approved by the NYSRC Executive Committee since Revision
No. 1 to the NYSRC Reliability Rules was issued in early 2001.

     The NYSRC Reliability Rules have been reorganized and reformatted to
be similar to the North American Electric Reliability Council reliability
rules and to enhance the NYSRC compliance review process.  Revision No. 2
contains 44 reliability rules and 42 measurements.  Ten (10) reliability
rules have been revised and four (4) new reliability rules have been added
since Revision No. 1.


     Should you have any questions, please contact me by email at
jcfleury@nyseg.com.

Secretary, NYSRC Executive Committee

"RE: Update following our meeting re. VEPCO","Kevin 

Doe this mean you think we should leave in the other damages e.g a fixed payment of $42,000 if we do not deliver for a scheduled day (the actual payment required to be paid to VEPCO for non-peak day damages is based in total MWH not delivered and is derived from the following formulae: 

(1 - MWH Delivered/MWH Scheduled) times Annual Capacity Payments/365 (this number equals approx $42,000)

The LD calc should be the hourly index and we need to eliminate the Peak Day designation damages.

Subject:	RE: Update following our meeting re. VEPCO

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

On the VEPCO contract we also need to consider the damages for failure to deliver scheduled energy.  Yesterday we talked about normal LDs.  This likely will not work if we are basing the VEPCO price on an hourly index since VEPCO's cost of cover would likely be close to hourly prices.

 Under the current contract, if we fail to deliver, EPMI is obligated to pay:

1.  Cost of Cover defined as either (a) (1) actual cost of incremental purchase or generation costs or if VEPCO is unable to make up the delivery obligations, then (2) VEPCO's highest cost source of generation minus (b) offered energy price (hourly index price under new proposal) Section 9.2); plus either

(A)  If VEPCO has designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of annual capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $530,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) (Section 9.3); or 

(B) If VEPCO has not designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of daily capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $42,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) Section 9.5); 

Let's think about what we should propose (eg 150% of index hourly price per hour of non-delivery?)


Thanks

Subject:	Update following our meeting re. VEPCO
Importance:	High

Everyone,

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP"" (the ""Index""). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"Data Problems","Paul,
I have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at.

1.  The number Mother data is pulling for Zone P is wrong.  The pointer for the data can be found on the SQL worksheet the expression is:
	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'DAYAHEAD', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_DA,
and	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'HOURLY', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_RT,

I have looked at the PJM and NY prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from.

2.  The other 24hr desk evidently has been told that the PJM night shift is to prep the PJM and Nepool portions of the shift notes.  That is fine with me.  I wrote a macro to pull, format and print the Nepool information.  The PJM information is not available on the website.  The East power portal has something.  I think it does some kind of Op Sum pull at some unknown interval.  The problem is the information is not accurate.  

Rob Bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other 24hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting.

2.a All data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata.  This makes me doubt that opsum is the source, as edata also pulls from opsum.

2.b When all interfaces and hubs are printing the same, the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website.  I have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right.  If the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at ""M:\Electric\24hour\PJM AVE\PJMSummary.exe"".  If they could fix this app I would care less about the web site.  If they do not want to fix the app I can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template.  I don't really care how I get the data, I just need to get yesterday's PJM for the shift note.

In other news, if you are trading some of the regular products, are you following the DA-RT physical moves?  If we do man the 24hr desk (even if Bryce is the day guy) we could cover the DA-RT physical.  Having it part of the 24hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the NY side in the early morning.

I only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading PJM to spend the same amount of time on the analysis.  It is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift.  Just a thought.

Thanks,
David

"RE: Update following our meeting re. VEPCO","CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

On the VEPCO contract we also need to consider the damages for failure to deliver scheduled energy.  Yesterday we talked about normal LDs.  This likely will not work if we are basing the VEPCO price on an hourly index since VEPCO's cost of cover would likely be close to hourly prices.

 Under the current contract, if we fail to deliver, EPMI is obligated to pay:

1.  Cost of Cover defined as either (a) (1) actual cost of incremental purchase or generation costs or if VEPCO is unable to make up the delivery obligations, then (2) VEPCO's highest cost source of generation minus (b) offered energy price (hourly index price under new proposal) Section 9.2); plus either

(A)  If VEPCO has designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of annual capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $530,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) (Section 9.3); or 

(B) If VEPCO has not designated day as a Peak Day (up to 30 per year), then rebate a portion of daily capacity payments (I think current amount would be about $42,000 per non-delivery if no MW delivered during day) Section 9.5); 

Let's think about what we should propose (eg 150% of index hourly price per hour of non-delivery?)


Thanks

Subject:	Update following our meeting re. VEPCO
Importance:	High

Everyone,

Here are some follow-up items from our meeting this morning. Please review them and let me know if there are any changes to this at your earliest.  As discussed, we will tie-in Dave and Elizabeth into the meeting via phone (it starts at c. 8:00AM CST).

Leslie Reeves has confirmed that we do not have any reserves against previous years' audit.

Attending the meeting from VEPCO:
Kevin Howell (President - Energy Trading).  Kevin was at Duke prior to VEPCO (started with VEPCO on 10/01/01)
Karla Haislip - Head of Origination
John Mable - Origination
Jim Hayes - Trading

Goal:  ENE will aim to settle against the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for VEPCO/Potomac interface + $5/MWh for delivery.  ENE will retain the option to deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.  The legal definition of the settlement index has been reviewed by Paul Thomas in Kevin's group, and will be as follows:

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered at the during the applicable hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period. The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC, for the  VEPCO Interface (VAP), on its official web site currently located at www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings ""PJM - Daily Real-Time Locational Marginal Pricing Files; VAP"" (the ""Index""). The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency. The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

"**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users","
We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

How will the cutover work.  If a trader, operator logins in at the new building will the 800 numbers not follow.  If so then we will bring in an extra crew at noon to login and get set up in the new building with a planned cut over around 3pm.  Once the transfer is done you will relocate the mapp equipment as well as the remaining ercot, midwest, southeast and northeast equipment to the new building.

The night shift will report to the new building at 6pm.

Thanks.

How many 1-800 phone numbers does power have? ( If any other than 24 Hr trading, please advise)
What is the number for 24 HR group? ( I will need to coordinate a cutover for this)
Do you know of any special phone needs for the weekend trading?  (The people on turrets will be fine, they pin in anywhere)

Any other thoughts or concerns are appreciated.

"NYS Reliability Council Executive Committee","     The Executive Committee of the New York State Reliability Council
(""NYSRC"") is posting this message to inform all interested parties of the
approval and posting of Revision No. 2 to the NYSRC Reliability Rules.  The
NYSRC Executive Committee approved Revision No. 2 at its January 11, 2002
meeting.  Revision No. 2 to the NYSRC Reliability Rules, which is attached
below and is posted on the NYSRC web site at ""www.nysrc.org"" under the
""Documents"" web page, is a compilation of all current NYSRC Reliability
Rules and Measurements.  Included in the document are all of the Proposed
Reliability Rules that were posted for comments, in accordance with NYSRC
Policy No. 1, and approved by the NYSRC Executive Committee since Revision
No. 1 to the NYSRC Reliability Rules was issued in early 2001.

     The NYSRC Reliability Rules have been reorganized and reformatted to
be similar to the North American Electric Reliability Council reliability
rules and to enhance the NYSRC compliance review process.  Revision No. 2
contains 44 reliability rules and 42 measurements.  Ten (10) reliability
rules have been revised and four (4) new reliability rules have been added
since Revision No. 1.


     Should you have any questions, please contact me by email at

"FW: URGENT- ACTION REQUESTED: Admins, please forward to users that have AMTEL equipment...","Good Morning...I wanted to let you know that once we get into the new building we will NOT be using the amtel for messages.  Please make sure you have MSN and that it is up and running.  Everyone in the group should already have MSN and we want to make sure we are okay so that you do not miss any messages when you are away from your desk.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: URGENT- ACTION REQUESTED: Admins, please forward to users that have AMTEL equipment... 


Due to desktop space constraints in the new Enron Center South facility, AMTEL equipment will not moved. The replacement for communications will be MSN Messenger. MSN Messenger will allow you to directly communicate with the person you are trying to reach. It will also alert you to their status (Busy, Away, On the Phone, Out to Lunch, etc.). The installation and configuration for MSN Messenger is simple. Please follow the steps listed below carefully to ensure a smooth installation.
 
To install MSN Messenger, first go to the Start Menu -> Programs -> System Utility Applications -> MSN Messenger icon. While navigating to the icon it may be necessary to pull down a ""double chevron"" if you don't see the folders specified above.
 

 
 
This will launch the setup for MSN Messenger. It should only take a few seconds. The configuration is very simple.
 
 

 
Follow the prompts closely to ensure a smooth setup.
 
On the first screen, titled Welcome to MSN Messenger Service!, click Next ->
 

 
Type in your standard enron.com email address. The format is firstname.lastname@enron.com <mailto:firstname.lastname@enron.com>. Please be sure that ""Use this program to talk to my Microsoft Exchange contacts"" box is checked. Click Next -> to continue.
 

 
Check the box labeled ""Use Exchange Instant Messaging only. (Do not connect to the Internet.)
Click Next -> to continue. Click the Finish button to complete the MSN Messenger setup.
 
After completing the setup wizard, you should be able to sign into the MSN Messenger Service. Click the blue text to sign in
 

 
Next, you will be prompted to confirm your email address. The box should look like this--
 

 
Click the ""OK"" button. If the connection is successful, you should be able to see a contact list. This is where you can view your contacts status and start communications. To add a person to your contact list, click the Add button. For general help, questions, or to learn the new emoticons ( Telephone receiver <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emphone.gif>,  Boy <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emboy.gif>,  Thumbs up <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/thumbu.gif>, etc.) For direct access to this link, click here <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/HelpWindow_msg.asp?Topic=InfoTech.asp&INI=msgv35.ini&SearchTerm=ffogol&S_Text=signing+in&H_APP=MSN%20Messenger%20Service&BrandID=MSMSGS&Filter=msgrxchg>.
 
Congratulations!
You can now begin using MSN Messenger and reclaim your desktop space.
 
If you experience errors or have problems installing MSN Messenger, please call the Enron Resolution Center at X31411. 
They will be able to help correct any problems you may experience.
 
Thanks,

"PJM November Transmission","Paul:

Attached are the most current PJM transmission recon reports for November business ($21K worth of transmission not accounted for).  As we have discussed, there are a lot of outstanding issues for November and that it is important that it be reconciled in order to charge the requests to the respective trade desk.

I know there has been some moving around where responsibilities have shifted in your group and that you have had some things going on that have occupied your time, all which have impacted this reconciliation process.  I have tied together what I could with the information that was provided but will need more help from you to work toward getting this completed.  It will be easier for your group as well as ours to get this fixed before the current month ends rather than after the fact which leaves the remainder of this week.

One thing that will help me help you is to know who some of the names are that I have been seeing on the Requests and what desks they are trading for (some are new and some are not).

R. MATTHEW
B. AIZMA
D. INGRAM
P. MAKKAI
B. TERP
D. LAURENT

It also looks like there may not be as many deals missing completely but rather needing to be identified with an Oasis Request.  Take a look at the files and see what you think.  Anything else I can do to help, please let me know.

Thanks,
Marci

"FW: PJM West","PJM West is scheduled to go into operation January 1, 2002 (there is some talk that the IT vendors are somewhat behind schedule do to the priority of getting NYC back in operation and that this may delay the startup - I will keep you posted).  On Day 1 of operation, PJM West will be the Allegheny control area only.  Work is progressing on Duquesne and the earliest date I have heard for integration of Duquesne into PJM West is sometime in the 1st quarter of 2002.  PJM West and PJM proper will be integrated such that there is one energy market (day-ahead and real-time) across the entire region, based on LMP, and no pancaking of transmission rates (pay the rate of the transmission system at point of withdrawal just as is done in PJM today).  However, there will be two different capacity markets - ICAP in PJM and ACAP in PJM West - to reflect the difference in reliability standards of the two NERC regions.

PJM has recently announced PJM West market trials for the Day-Ahead market on Nov 21 and Nov 28.  Real-time energy market trials are scheduled to be conducted starting on Nov 26 and continuing through Dec 31.  For additional information regarding the market trial see the enclosed notice from PJM.

Tom, could you do a paragraph up that describes PJM West (i.e operation, LMP, players, key dates, tx instruments etc) for Robert Benson and copy it to Kevin (they only want a paragraph at most).  They are especially interested in whether PJM West intend to price aggregate nodes to create hubs on start date.  Theres no point in me acting as intermediary....

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Immunex Spending $500 Million on New
Rhode Island Plant to Produce Enbrel, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Health/Medical Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc; Houston) The
Immunex Corporation (Nasdaq:IMNX)(Seattle) is set to start
construction on a fourth manufacturing plant for their very profitable
arthritis therapy, Enbrel(R). Immunex enjoyed a third quarter 2001 net
income of approximately $40 million, an increase of 26% over the same
period last year. Immunex is working towards ensuring enough
manufacturing capacity to support an anticipated $5 to $6 billion in
Enbrel(R) sales over the next five years.
	   Dubbed the ""BioNext Project,"" the new facility is being engineered
by Kvaerner Process (Bridgewater, N.J.), with Turner Construction
(Dallas) handling construction management. The plant will house one of
the largest bioreactors used in the industry, estimated to be 20,000
liters in capacity. There will also be a centralized utility area
featuring water-for-injection (WFI), clean steam, and other central
utility services.
	   The project is adjacent to an existing facility that is currently
being retrofitted to produce Enbrel(R) in an agreement with
Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals (Saint Davids, Pa.), another division of
American Home Products Corporation (NYSE:AHP) (Madison, N.J.), which
has 41% ownership of Immunex. AHP has agreed to sell Immunex the
facility, which it purchased in 1999 specifically for the production
of Enbrel(R). The new plant is expected to employ 350 people once
construction is complete in 2005.
	   The Immunex Corporation was founded in 1981. The biopharmaceutical
company focuses on immune system science innovations, with Enbrel(R),
their rheumatoid arthritis therapy, adding heavily to their 2000
revenues of $861.8 million and a net income of $154.4 million.

market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

Please make sure you do the following before you leave tonight....Thanks for your help.  Tjae
 
Subject:	IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.

In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

"Orders issued today in NYISO and ISO-NE proceedings","Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

And they recommend your firm to  other companies.   Losing customers is easy if they aren't't satisfied with  the product.  Sales reps hate explaining away problems,  but they know that customer dissatisfaction must be  resolved before they can sell anything else.   Make training part of your delivery process.  A short training  session over the web is one cost effective way.  Click  below to learn more:   Contact Us  ?     ""Customer Service Training Made Easy""  . Front line employees who contact customers daily have  an impact on sales.  Their understanding and response  to customer needs can create a positive image or  negative image of your company if they do it wrong.  It  can mean the difference between repeat business or a  lost customer.   Customer Service Training is important but often  difficult to deliver.  First, this is always a busy  position.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

Sent:	Friday, October 19, 2001 4:19 PM
To:	Benchluch, Moises; Will, Lloyd
Subject:	PowerSurge login update


Lloyd, Stephen, 
 
FriedWire had to revamp our password procedures for the PowerSurge trial as we had some conflicts with the Traffic Report login system.    You should go through the following steps to login to PowerSurge using the test IDs I sent you a couple of days ago.
 
Go to www.friedwire.com 
Click ""PowerSurge Login""
Agree to all parts of the End User Agreement and click ""Accept"" at the bottom
Customize or confirm (at least) your User Name, Password, First/Last Name, E-Mail Address and click ""Save"" at the bottom
Click ""Login"".  This will take you back to FriedWire.Com where you then go through the PowerSurge Login with your new info.

 
Let me clarify (if need be) that you all are testing a pre-release version of this product.  As I noted earlier, we are tuning for performance, backfilling historical data, fixing bugs, etc.  This is not the trial of a completed product and we are relying on you all to give us your feedback (positive or negative) so we can know where we stand and make the product as good as it can be.  
 
Call (303) 447-0288 and press my extension 31 or ""0"" if you need any help.  You can also e-mail us at support@friedwire.com .  Thanks again for your help in testing.
 
Stuart Wright

"","On September 25, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission),  
revisions to its Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff (Services Tariff) and its Open-Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) to make
permanent two temporary market rules pertaining to External Transactions that were initially implemented as  Extraordinary Corrective Actions, and to introduce several new enhancements to its external transaction scheduling processes:  1) provisions to ensure that Exports are evaluated consistently for purposes of scheduling and curtailment by incorporating the concept of ""Sink Price Cap Bids"" into, and by eliminating the concept of ""default"" Decremental Bids, and 2) revising the time priod within which it will perform the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME).  Currently NYISO runs BME 90 minutes ahead of each dispatch hour.  The revisions would allow NYISO to use BME at any time no later than 90 minutes before the hour.    The NYISO has
     requested a waiver of the usual sixty day notice period so that
     this filing can become effective on October 30, 2001.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count.

"Rockland Electric Transfer to PJM","On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joint application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJM of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service territory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM (note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in northern Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Divisions respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the operational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly interconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not approve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, therefore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional resources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 miles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the filing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

"FW: PowerSurge Update:  Setting up your Price Alerts","fyi

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	""Stuart Wright"" <stuart@friedwire.com>@ENRON  
Sent:	Thursday, November 01, 2001 8:06 AM
To:	PowerSurge Update List
Subject:	PowerSurge Update:  Setting up your Price Alerts


[IMAGE][IMAGE] FriedWire's Price Alert System
 
""I'm so busy on the trading floor, I need a product that has a finger that comes out of the screen pokes me when I need to pay attention. Can you make me one of those?""
 
A client of FriedWire made this request some time ago.  In an attempt to server his needs we considered being the first company to provide personal desktop robots for traders, but at a staff meeting we determined that no one here knew anything about robots.  So instead we developed a flexible electronic event notification system.
 
In FriedWire's Traffic Report, the notification system delivers market news and transmission emergency information.  In PowerSurge the notification system provides Price Alerts.  If you need to know when prices change or reach certain upper or lower limits, and you don't want to stare at the screen all day, you might want to check out this PowerSurge feature.
 
The Price Alerts (a.k.a ""My Price Alerts"") are completely customizable for each FriedWire login.  An easy-to-use interface allows you to select:
the price nodes and markets of interest to you, 
when to be contacted (when prices rise or fall according to your criteria), 
how to be contacted (e-mail or wireless page), 
when during the day/week to notify you and how often,
and more!

 
[IMAGE]
 
Once you have customized your alerts, you can review them in the list of ""My Price Alerts""  Here you can turn them on or off, edit, or delete them. We recommend that you take advantage of the ability to set custom alert names and alert messages.  These help you remember your strategy when you created the alert.
 
[IMAGE]
 
You can review your alerts within PowerSurge when you see ""You Have Alerts!"" in the upper left corner of the screen.  Clicking on that link will display your current alerts.  
 
[IMAGE]
 
But if you're not logged in to PowerSurge when your event happens, don't worry because the same information will also appear in your email inbox or wireless pager/cell phone.
 
Login to PowerSurge to see this and other features.

"Associate / Analyst Program","
After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Fate of Enron's Forest Products Group Up
in the Air, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston) Energy giant Enron Corporation (NYSE:ENE) (Houston), also the
seventh largest newsprint producer in North America, recently agreed
to be taken over by energy rival Dynegy Incorporated (NYSE:DYN)
(Houston). Dynegy has given the forest products group, which falls
under Enron's Wholesale Services business segment, an ""under review""
status in determining which businesses are core or non-core. Whether
Dynegy sheds or retains its papermaking assets may not be known before
the summer of 2002, when the transaction is expected to close. The
forest products group consists of a mill on the east coast and two in
eastern Canada, which will require an infusion of capital for
improvements.
	   Last year, Enron Industrial Markets purchased Garden State Paper
from Media General, a communications company, for roughly $72 million.
Located in Garfield, N.J., the mill employs 290 people and has a
capacity of 240,000 short tons a year of newsprint.
	   Earlier this year, Enron acquired Daishowa Forest Products Limited
to gain ownership of its newsprint mill and related assets in Quebec
City, Quebec. The former Daishowa Forest mill, now called Papiers
Stadacona is integrated with a Thermo-Mechanical Pulp (TMP) mill that
feeds four paper machines and employs over 1,000 employees. The mill
has studied the addition of a new de-inking plant, a bio-mass boiler,
and modernizations to the four paper machines.
	   NLK Consultants and Enron share ownership in the Papier Masson
mill in Masson-Angers, Quebec. The single machine mill employs over
300 workers and produces approximately 600 metric tons a day of
recycled content newsprint.
	   Upon completion of the merger, the new Dynegy is expected to have
revenues exceeding $200 billion and $90 billion in assets.
	   Dynegy is one of the world's premier energy merchants. Through its
global energy delivery network and marketing, trading and risk
management capabilities, Dynegy provides innovative solutions to
customers in North America and the United Kingdom and Continental
Europe.

"","04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

"FW: ER01-1385 ConEd v. NYISO -- FERC Order Rejecting Extension of Special Market Power MitigationMeasures for NYC","In yet another Order issued yesterday (see attached), FERC rejects the request by Con Edison to extend the Revised Localized Market-Power Mitigation Measures (Revised LMM)* until October 31, 2002. The Revised LMM had been approved by FERC on July 20  (on rehearing after initially rejected them on May 16), but were required in that Order to expire on October 31, 2001. FERC denies Con Ed's requested extension because it was ""procedurally improper,"" and directs the NYISO to address FERC's concerns regarding the revised LMM as part of the comprehensive mitigation proposal FERC required the NYISO to prepare by March 1 in its AMP extension order also issued yesterday. (An email regarding that Order has been sent to you separately.) In particular, FERC wants to know how the revised LMM will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures in effect or proposed; whether the mitigation is designed to apply only in must-run situations or more broadly and why; whether market conditions in NYC warrant structural triggers for market power mitigation; and whether in-city mitigation measures should apply to all generation in the City or just to the units divested by Con Edison. FERC again directs the NYISO to consider mitigation measures used by PJM and ISO-NE to aid in the transition to a Northeast RTO. Finally, FERC directs Con Ed and the NYISO to make a filing that removes all in-city mitigation measures from Con Ed's tariff and puts them into the ISO's tariff. Significantly, FERC directs the NYISO to address in that filing, ""and remedy to the extent required in NYISO's tariff and in the operations of NYISO and ConEd, allegations...that ConEd currently has operational responsibility for the New York City transmission grid and can direct out-of-merit dispatch. Ultimate responsibility for such functions, if not hands-on operational control, must lie with NYISO rather than ConEd."" Elimination of ConEd's ability to dispatch units out-of-merit is crucial to the proper functioning of the markets in New York City. Development of the comprehensive market mitigation plan called for in both this and the AMP order by March 1 is going to be an enormous and time consuming undertaking for the NYISO and market participants over the next three months.
----------------
* The Revised LMM expanded the application of the LMM approved by FERC in 1998 as part of Con Ed's generation divestiture proposal to: (1) bids for sale of energy in the real time markets during constrained periods; (2) bids for min gen and start-up whenever gen must be operated out-of-merit due to local reliability requirements; (3) bids for start-up and min gen during constrained periods (i.e., whenever mitigation would apply to a unit's incremental energy bid); and (4) all generators located electrically within NYC, not just those divested by Con Edison.

"Invoice Info","Paul......I talked with Frank at NYISO. He said that you are able to get the invoice info off of their website. Just go to OASIS/bidding and scheduling/user login. I believe you were going to admin login earlier. Anyway, can you take a look at it and let me know what you find? Thanks.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Refinance options","Hi Paul,
Finally drug your file out to the basement.  I have attached several
different options in the Excel file below.  Keep in mind that about 5 weeks
after closing you will receive a check from your current lender for the
existing escrow account.  You can either pocket that money or ""reimburse""
your out put from this closing.  Let me know if you need further
clarification on this or any of the options.  I've attached the application
and forms I need for processing.  I have survey, dec page and mortgage info
already mostly need updated W2, paystubs and banking info.

I didn't speak with your coworker yesterday unless I'm really losing it.
Ask him to give me a call anytime or give me his name and I'll give him a
call.  Thanks so much for calling and I look forward to helping you save
some money.

"FW: NYMOC - Houston, Texas: December 11-13","Attached is the NYISO's Notice for its training course to be held in Houston on December 11-13. Those who wish to attend should make arrangements directly with the NYISO. On-line registration is available at their web-site listed below.

-----Original Message-----
From: market_relations@nyiso.com [mailto:market_relations@nyiso.com]
Sent: Monday, October 29, 2001 3:12 PM
To: market_relations@nyiso.com
Subject: NYMOC - Houston, Texas: December 11-13



market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear NYISO Market Participants:

On December 11 - 13, 2001 the NYISO will present NYMOC in the Lone Star
State. We've just posted the course on our web site at

http://www.nyiso.com/services/training/cinfo/index.html

This course is similar to NYMOCs run in the Albany NY area, except that it
does not include Billing and Accounting details. The program will address
the latest system updates, however, and rigorously covers all marketplace
topics.

The course will be conducted at the Hyatt Regency Houston, 1200 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas, from 8:30 am  Tuesday December 11 until 3:00 pm
Thursday December 13. If you're interested, we suggest you register early
as we expect a healthy turn-out. In order to get a realistic count, there
will be a $300 charge for no-shows, or for cancellations not made by 12:00
noon Monday, December 3.

Please call Customer Relations at (518) 356-6060, if you have any questions
regarding the course, or Debbie Doyle at (518) 356-6274 regarding
registrations.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Price Reservations 30 January 2002 Real-Time and Hour-Ahead Markets, and 31 January 2002 Day-Ahead Market","The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 10:00, 17:00, and 23:00 in the
January 30, 2002 Real-Time Market.

Prices in the January 31, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Paul,

Regarding the phone conversation we had last week, please be aware of the
following:

- I mis-spoke when I stated that a letter will be going out to Enron
containing the details of the total assessment. The letter that did go out
to customers was distributed on the TIE email list and was only a generic
explanation. That email is included below for your information.

- The details that I had promised are included in the attached spreadsheet
file.

I am still trying to find out when you will receive the invoice for this
assessment. When I have that information, I'll pass it on.

I hope the attached information is useful to you.

Thanks,
Dave Evanoski

Subject:	NY Market Training Course

Bruce Bleiweis of Reliant called me today (he had my number handy at the time rather than yours) regarding an upcoming training course offered by the NY ISO.  The course is scheduled for Nov 13 and is the 3-1/2 day ""Market Orientation Course"".  Reliant has 28 people signed up for the course and was wondering if there was any interest in Enron in attending the course and, if so, how many.  He is working with the training dept at the NYISO to see if the course can be given in Houston rather than NY since there appears to be much interest in at least his company.  He is checking with other companies in Houston (such as Dynegy, Shell, El Paso, etc) to get a feel for their interest and make it more attractive for the ISO to go to Houston and conduct the course.  Do you want to check with the Houston (commercial, government affairs, etc) to see if there is interest in this course (you may know already if anyone from Houston has signed-up for the course, or we might get it from the NYISO)?

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Startup Mining Company Hopes to Expand
Only U.S. Fluorspar Mine, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Located close to Cedar City, Utah, a start-up mining
venture hopes to expand the only fluorspar mine in the U.S. According
to company's President, John Price, ""Milford Mining Company LLC is the
only miner of fluorspar in the U.S."" Price went on to say, ""We've
started of on a small scale, but our market shows promise and if all
goes well, we may look at expanding in the future.""
	   According to data collected by the USGS, the U.S. consumes
approximately 523,000 metric tons of fluorspar annually. All of this
is imported from foreign sources, 67% from China, 22% from South
Africa, and 11% from Mexico. The majority of this, about 90%, is acid
grade fluorspar used in the production of hydrofluoric acid and
aluminum fluoride.
	   Milford Mining produces metallurgical grade fluorspar and also
kaolinite and silica. It is studying options for the sale of these
minerals to new markets. Currently, it sells fluorspar to west coast
cement plants, where it is used as a fluxing agent in rotary kilns.
Fluorspar helps to reduce the melting temperature of clinker (an
intermediate product of the cement manufacturing process produced in
rotary kilns), enabling cement producers to increase throughput
without significant equipment additions. Future plans include adding
increased crushing, screening, and processing equipment to enable the
company to expand service to the cement industry, as well as other
metallurgical grade fluorspar users such as the steel or aluminum
industries and possibly acid grade fluorspar users at some point in
the future.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Metals & Minerals or Energy markets as
well as other industrial sectors send inquiries to

"RE: Trading Limits","Paul, 
I just wanted to confirm that I understood our conversation.

We are limited to 150 MW short or long until some future date.
I understand that limit will be expanded as we gain more experience.

As an aside, I wanted to explain a little better why I felt, if not comfortable, at least not painfully uncomfortable carrying what would normally be considered a fairly large position.

1.  Off Peak is only 7 hours of exposure, meaning it is less than 1/2 the time length exposure. 
2.  Off Peak PJM is historically much less volitile, than the peak period.
3.  My long position was at a fairly low price ($15)
4.  My main motivation was to get some transaction volume to get more players involved in the market.  Most of the potential counterparties I called were not used to having a market.  I had to explain how to use EOL limit orders to a number night shift counterparties.  I intentionally wanted to get them to make their first trade.  I was overzealous in my approach.  

I intend to continue trying to drive volume, while taking reasonable positions, until the various players are more comfortable in the market, but will ensure I keep my exposure inside the 150 MW limit.   

Thanks,
David

Subject:	Trading Limits

While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW.  If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position.  If you have any questions please let me know.  

I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack... then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.

"Halloween Party!","Enron Corporation, The Princeton Review, and the Association of Rice Alumni
would like to invite you to:

THE 2001 HALLOWEEN MONSTER BASH

Houston's definitive, all-out Halloween party:

	Friday, October 26
	8:00 pm
	Garden in the Heights

We are proud to announce the return of the Halloween Monster Bash on Friday,
October 26 at Garden in the Heights.  You may remember this party from 1998;
it was a smash success then and will be at least as much fun this year.
We've got an awesome DJ, and tickets include light food and all the drinks
you can handle.

Door prizes including gift certificates from Houston's finest restaurants
will be awarded for best costumes.

The tickets are essentially at a break-even price, but if there is any money
left over, it will go to Rice's scholarship/fellowship fund, so Rice can
continue to attract even smarter, harder-working students than they've
already got.

DETAILS
Date:  Friday, October 26
Time:  8:00 PM til midnight or so
Place:  Garden in the Heights, 3926 Feagan
	(if you need directions, please call (713) 880-1065)

TICKETS
Tickets:  $25 with costume or $30 without.
How to get tickets:  Call the Rice Alumni Office at (713) 348-4057 for
advance tickets, or buy them at the door.

SPONSORSHIPS
Group and corporate sponsorships are available.  Enron, The Princeton
Review, and the law firm of Hirsch & Westheimer have already signed on as
sponsors.

This party is not exclusive in any way - all of Houston is invited (everyone
over 21, that is).  So please invite your friends and encourage them to
come.

You may get other emails about this as well, as we try our hardest to get
the word out.  I hope to see you there!

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.

Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

How will the cutover work.  If a trader, operator logins in at the new building will the 800 numbers not follow.  If so then we will bring in an extra crew at noon to login and get set up in the new building with a planned cut over around 3pm.  Once the transfer is done you will relocate the mapp equipment as well as the remaining ercot, midwest, southeast and northeast equipment to the new building.

The night shift will report to the new building at 6pm.

Do you know of any special phone needs for the weekend trading?  (The people on turrets will be fine, they pin in anywhere)

Any other thoughts or concerns are appreciated.

Thank you,

"November & December 1999 Settlement Adjustments","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants:

On the November 1999 & December 1999 Transmission Customer Monthly
Statements many customers have noted under the ""Energy Settlement"" section
for ""Forward Energy"" a change in MW-Hrs with no associated change in dollar
amounts.  This is because of a correction in the sign convention for the
MW-Hrs related to external generation transactions (transactions from a
proxy bus to the NYISO reference bus).  For all other types of transactions
the NYISO charges customers the appropriate TUC or LBMP  based on the MWs
that flowed, but for external generation transactions, customers receive
payments from the NYISO, and therefore these types of transactions have an
opposite sign convention.

The dollars associated with the external generation transactions have
always had the proper sign convention, but the MW-Hrs have not.  On
01/17/2000 this sign convention was corrected for all billing months going
forward resulting in the correct MW-Hr values being reported from February
2000 to date.  However, November 1999 - January 2000 did not have the
proper MW-Hrs reported on the Transmission Customer Monthly Statements.
With the latest settlement adjustments posted the MW-Hrs are being
corrected with the proper sign convention.  Transmission Customers will see
similar changes in their forward energy MW-Hrs for January 2000's
settlement adjustment.

If you have any questions please contact your Customer Relations
representative at 518-356-6060.

Subject:	VEPCO

Kevin and Elizabeth,

Attached is a proposal summarizing our restructuring talks with VEPCO last week.  We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They'd requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.

Discussion summary:
?	Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).
?	Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.
?	VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).
?	Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index
?	Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany
?	Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary
?	Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01

We have already finalized Sept. P&L....our deadline was 5 p.m. yesterday.  Therefore, any changes from what was issued yesterday will simply come back to you in a flash adjustment at the end of this month or the following month.  Its possible that price revisions occurred which were not picked up by the download in Enpower.

Thanks.

Casey,
I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.

Your final showed $341,000.

Please give me a call.

"Schedule 1 Fee Changes","At Friday's NYISO Management Committee meeting, two proposals were approved that will affect next year's rate schedule 1 charges. The first involves the assessment of regulatory fees charged by FERC for its electric industry costs. As you are aware, effective next year, FERC will be changing the way its electric program costs are assessed to market participants. Under the new method, a unit charge will be assessed against public utilities providing transmission service, including ISOs. NYISO estimates an annual assessment of $4-6 million. These fees will start to be recovered through the rate Schedule 1 charge effective January 1, 2002. This should equate to roughly $0.03 per MWH. The second item approved at Friday's meeting concerned the proposed 2002 budget for the NYISO. Total costs will be increasing roughly $12 million, which will raise the schedule 1 charges for running the ISO (currently $0.60 per MWH) by $0.03 to $0.05 per MWH, depending on the size of the proposed contingency fund that may be included by the Board. Offsetting these increases is the elimination of a $0.30 per MWH charge that has been collected during most of 2001 to create a $50 miilion working capital fund. The ISO expects to achieve full funding of this fund by the end of the current year.

Paul:

Attached are the most current PJM transmission recon reports for November business ($21K worth of transmission not accounted for).  As we have discussed, there are a lot of outstanding issues for November and that it is important that it be reconciled in order to charge the requests to the respective trade desk.

I know there has been some moving around where responsibilities have shifted in your group and that you have had some things going on that have occupied your time, all which have impacted this reconciliation process.  I have tied together what I could with the information that was provided but will need more help from you to work toward getting this completed.  It will be easier for your group as well as ours to get this fixed before the current month ends rather than after the fact which leaves the remainder of this week.

One thing that will help me help you is to know who some of the names are that I have been seeing on the Requests and what desks they are trading for (some are new and some are not).

R. MATTHEW
B. AIZMA
D. INGRAM
P. MAKKAI
B. TERP
D. LAURENT

It also looks like there may not be as many deals missing completely but rather needing to be identified with an Oasis Request.  Take a look at the files and see what you think.  Anything else I can do to help, please let me know.

Thanks,
Marci

"Reduction of OOM?","
It would appear that the plague of OOM requests that have distorted prices
in New York may soon be reduced to the point that a true market may evolve
and introduce some interest in serving load without the unhedgable risk of
""uplift charges"".

The difficulty in looking ahead is to determine what the real prices will be
without the numerous OOM requests that have been made in the past. The
information that has been published in the past with regard to generation
OOM did not quantify how much generation was removed from the bid stack at
any one time. Certainly a significant number of  peak hours were affected
but it is unknown to what degree. At a guess a number of hours probably had
over 1000 MW of generation OOM, effectively removing this generation from
the bid stack but showing up as ""uplift charges"" on that portion of the
electricity bill.

Two pieces of information would be extremely helpful in taking a stab at
what the energy prices should have been/are without the large OOM shadow
bilateral market that presently exists.

1. How much generation in aggregate was loaded OOM for each hour in each
zone?
2. Approximately how much was the uplift assigned to each zone on a daily
basis?

On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent presentation
to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined
that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each
that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this conspiracy
theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely,
especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher impact
on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all
colluding in tandem.
What should be of concern does not seem to be on their radar screen. Why are
there so many OOM requests in NYC alone? Despite the more complex system in
NYC the number of requests is significant. The resultant distortion in price
has the result of making a market that is very difficult to predict and very
difficult to hedge. The uplift charges assigned to those trying to serve
load can be devastating, well that is those without the ability to pass it
through.
An interesting market development has resulted from the numerous OOM
requests. The numerous OOM requests have translated into unhedgeable uplift
that deters retail competition. The result of a lack of retail competition
would be that customers would continue to reside with the incumbent provider
instead of with another retail provider. While this may not be the intent of
OOM requests it is realistically the result and one that should be garnering
the attention of regulators to a higher degree than other theoretical
scenarios.

The continued practice to over regulate this market will deter generator
development. I have heard some arguments that the CAP market in NYC will
ensure investment and construction of new generation. To be clear the
argument pointed to the current cap of ~$112/kw/year and that this would
ensure that generation would be developed. ICAP payments are not a
guaranteed revenue stream to any generator, especially payments of
$9.40/kw/month. New generation will result in more competition for the
payments which will result in lower capacity prices, especially in the
longer term. There is only a fixed amount of load and reductions in ICAP
prices do not result in an increase in demand for ICAP, prices will come
down; a review of the recent ICAP auctions proves that this true. The larger
the assumption for ICAP payments in a new generator development proforma,
the increased risk that is assumed going forward, especially in light of the
high regulatory risk in this market. A 25% decline in ICAP payments would be
devastating to a proforma that relied heavily on ICAP as a revenue stream.
Certainly the recent auction clearing prices suggest that the volatility is
greater than 25% and therefore concludes that an assumption for high ICAP
revenues are not a substitute for a viable and competitive energy market.
Certainly looking at the current forward prices, the surplus of ICAP and the
mitigated volatility it will not be long before generators with low capacity
factors and high maintenance costs will be closely examining the economics
of continuing to participate in the market.

In conclusion the modeling of the 138 KV in NYC promises to reduce OOM
requests by 70%, hopefully this will be the result. Certainly a significant
increase in information for OOM requests should be posted that should
include what load pocket, how much generation is loaded OOM and any other
information that is pertinent including a mechanism to request an audit of
those OOM requests to determine their validity. If all the requests are
always valid then there should not be a problem subjecting requests to an
audit. OOM requests are a deviation from the market based software dispatch,
these exceptions to the normal dispatch should be examined as closely as
generators are scrutinized when they deviate from their scheduled
dispatches.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) French Chemical and Explosives Producer
Creates Measure to Self-Regulate, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 27, 2001--The following in an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Groupe SNPE (Paris, France) announced
plans on December 10, 2001 to regulate and improve safety at it three
plants in Toulouse, France. SNPE announced that it would spend several
million francs to improve plant safety at it Toulouse facilities. The
plan includes the formation of a commission of local delegates with
the authority to order investigations and acquire knowledge about
safety issues relating to the three plants. Included in SNPE's plan is
the limitation of storage tank capacity to two tons and limiting
access of non-authorized personel to the plant. The neighboring
Atofina Grande Paroisse fertilizer plant explosion in September
damaged SNPE's three plants. These plants have been shut down since
the explosion pending a decision by the French government as to
regulations concerning the proximity of industrial plants to
residential areas.
	   SNPE's announcement came a day before Yves Cochet, the French
Environmental Minister, conducted national debates with nearly 7,000
people regarding industrial site proximity to residential areas. On
November 13, 2001, SNPE opened its plants in Toulouse for neighboring
residents to tour. Tours involved explanations of SNPE's manufacturing
process as well as the practical applications of their products.
	   Groupe SNPE was founded in 1971 and produces fine chemicals plus
explosives and propellants used in the pharmaceutical, intermediates,
agrochemical, and defense industries. The company's products are
marketed in 70 different countries and have subsidiaries in Asia,
Europe, and North America.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

Joe has brought up some great  points once again. As Tom has pointed out
that
the NYISO should be in the forefront in addressing this. Since 1999 the PAR
issue has been brought up time and time again, both in committees and in
direct
complaints to the NYISO. The ball is squarely in the NYISO's court. I,
would
like to see on this forum, an update/discussion from the NYISO addressing
Joe's
concerns. If nothing else it would bring everyone up to date on where we
are on
this issue. All too often good points are brought up on this forum, just to
die
because there was no NYISO imput or the answer was off line.

"Who is in Control?","
""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In order to have a functioning market model it is imperative to have a
level playing field for all market participants.

Is it a level playing field or even appropriate for any individual
market participant to dispatch generation and transmission facilities
that affect the economics of other market participants? The dispatch of
transmission and generation to resolve congestion must be made with the
overall economics of the entire market in mind. The only entity that has
the information and empowered to make these decisions is the NYISO.

With that in mind why does a particular market participant have control
over major interfaces that interconnect New York and PJM. Specifically
the control points would be the Linden-Goethals phase angle regulator
and the Hudson Farragut phase angle regulators. These PARs are under
ConEd control and are utilized by ConEd to facilitate whatever
requirements they deem required. As this is being written the New York
PJM schedule is 546 MW out to New York with a flow of 762 MW the flow on
these PARs (including Ramapo) is ~1500 MW to New York.

Are the interests of all market participants being considered by a
market participant that has over 40% of the load in New York State, that
has control over a significant amount of generation utilizing OOM
dispatches and by having control over a significant amount of
transmission facilities capable of altering the flow into New York City
and Central x East.

I suspect not.

Case in point..

There is a transmission constraint in an area in New York city. This
constraint can only be monitored by ConEd and therefore is resolved
utilizing an OOM dispatch request. Generation was reduced to resolve the
constraint, there is another generator in the area that can be reduced
to resolve the constraint, but it would appear that this control action
is not utilized . Coincidently the power from this other generator is
under contract to ConEd (take-or-pay). There is also a PAR
(Linden-Goethals) that can be moved to alleviate the constraint, which
unfortunately is not utilized either. Instead generation is reduced that
does result in additional uplift charges that is socialized as a cost to
all loads in New York. Whether the right economic decisions are being
made is an issue but the larger issue is why is a market participant
with a large economic interest making these decisions.

The NYISO was asked why the PAR was not utilized as a control action to
alleviate the constraint, simply put since the PAR is not under their
control they do not consider it as a control action.

Since ConEd does not have the overall market view or the economic
interests of all market participants in mind is it appropriate to allow
them to operate and dispatch a large part of New York State?

When the NYISO is not controlling major inter-area transmission
interfaces but allows that control to be utilized by a market
participant it is a compromise of the entire market. Economics of an
individual market participant are overriding the economics of all other
participants in New York.

This is not a ""best practice"" that any sane individual would recommend
for any RTO model.

Lloyd, these are the IDs that are enabled for Traffic Report and PowerSurge access.  Feel free to pass them out as needed.  If anyone wants to really check these systems out thoroughly (particularly PowerSurge), I would highly recommend a 30-40 minute remote tutorial with either Barbara O'Neill or Mike McNair, the two primary developers of the PowerSurge product.

The image is a panoramic view of the world from the new space station.
It is a night photo with the lights clearly indicating the populated
areas.

You can scroll East-West and  North-South.  Note that Canada's
population is almost exclusively  along the U.S. border. Moving east
to Europe, there is a high  population concentration along the
Mediterranean Coast. It's easy to  spot London, Paris, Stockholm
and Vienna. Check out the development  of Israel compared to the
rest of the Arab countries.

Note the Nile River and the rest of the ""Dark Continent"". After the
Nile, the lights don't come on again until Johannesburg. Look at the
Australian Outback and the Trans-Siberian Rail Route. Moving east, the
most striking observation is the difference between North and South
Korea.

Note the density of Japan.

What a piece of photography. It is an absolutely awesome picture of
the Earth taken from the Boeing built Space Station last November on a
perfect night with no obscuring atmospheric conditions.

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your Enron laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employees and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2268D).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence.

"FW: Move Related Issues","

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

"PowerSurge:  New feature update","
FriedWire has just placed a number of enhancements into the new PowerSurge System, which is now fully released and available to be licensed:
 
NEW 
}         Search tools - as opposed to pull-down menu filtering
}         Front Page ""Pop-out"" components (Click-on ""Pop"" to cut that chart/map out and place it in a dedicated window on your desktop and have it update 'live' all day long even though you might close PowerSurge entirely)
}         On screen pop-ups for event notification (i.e. price change alerts -you still get the e-mail or page but also an on-screen alert)
 
COMING -  Within the next  couple of weeks we're adding:
}         Frequency disruption notification so you can get e-mail or a text-page when there's a frequency dip in the east
}         Customizable scales on your price and spread charts
}         Small, medium and large sized graphs that pop-out and fit your available screen real-estate
}         Pop-outs for all price and flow maps
 
Incentive pricing on PowerSurge is available for November.  Contact us for details.

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Out-of-Merit","From time to time there have been discussions in the TIE list criticizing
Con Edison for its involvement in out-of-merit actions, implying that it is
inappropriate for Con Edison control room operators to make such requests.
In its recent order on the Revised Local Mitigation Measures, FERC, in
response to allegations made by Orion, ordered the NYISO to take
responsibility for out-of-merit.

The Con Edison system has the world's most concentrated use of energy for
residential and commercial purposes. It is also a highly
transmission-constrained area where transfer limitations under normal and
second contingency conditions require certain minimum generation levels
within specific load pockets to assure reliability under existing
reliability rules. One of the main functions of the Con Edison control
center is to be vigilant of system conditions at all times and prevent the
system from reaching an unreliable operating state. When such conditions are
imminent, the Con Edison operator so advises the NYISO. Some parties have
said that Con Edison operators should never make out-of-merit requests. Con
Edison operators would be acting irresponsibly if they were to detect an
imminent unreliable operating condition and just sit back and not inform the
NYISO of the potential danger. Con Edison operators have been trained to
focus on operating the New York City system. The NYISO operators have a much
wider state-wide focus. It is entirely appropriate for both a transmission
owner (TO) and NYISO operators to work cooperatively in maintaining
reliability with the clear understanding that under the FERC-approved
tariff, it is the NYISO that has sole responsibility for reliability. I
would like to clarify that all involvement by Con Edison operators in
out-of-merit actions are based on the following  FERC-approved process in
which the NYISO, and not the TO operator, has sole responsibility for these
actions.

	The NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, Section 5.4,  Operations Under
Adverse Conditions states in essence that:
		*	The NYISO shall operate the system in accordance
with Reliability Rules, including local rules
		*	The NYISO will do this, among other measures, by
adjusting generator output levels
		*	The NYISO has sole responsibility for declaring that
Adverse Conditions are imminent
		*	Activation of these actions shall involve a two-step
process
			1.	The TO involved will advise the NYISO that
an Adverse Condition is imminent and recommend action
			2.	The NYISO activates the appropriate
procedures
		*	Records of the activation of such procedures shall
be maintained by both the TO and the NYISO

Having stated the above, let me also say that Con Edison has been working
with NYISO operations to minimize the occurrences of conditions that require
Con Edison operators to request actions that result in OOM operations. Con
Edison supports current efforts by the NYISO to manage load pocket
reliability events in a way that SCD can be used to maintain reliability
with in-merit generation.

In effect, the FERC recent order does not require any change from present
practice which is, and has always been, in compliance with Section 5.4 of
the NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, and in compliance with FERC's recent order:
the NYISO is solely responsible for out-of-merit actions.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

"SKI TRIP","All right people, time to quit screwing around and to start planning a
little weekend trip up here to Tahoe!  I'm thinking either the 1st or 3rd
weekend of March...  I have a friend who's a travel agent and can most
likely get everyone a good deal given enough advance notice.  Let me know
sometime this week if you're serious about going and what weekend you vote
for and I'll get some prices together...

"NYISO-related filings","Two items of note with regard to NYISO:

- 	On November 5, 2001, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade filed a complaint against the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO), requesting that the Commission restore the original market clearing prices for energy for May 9, 2000.  PSEG claims that NYISO violated its tariff and Commission orders approving Temporary Extraordinary Procedure (TEP) authority by 1) identifying a purported market flaw associated with bids submitted by an Energy Limited Resource and 2) remedying the market flaw by re-pricing certain hourly clearing prices in a manner inconsistent with its tariff on May 8 & 9, 2000.  PSEG was a seller in the real time market on May 9, 2000 and lost revenues as a result of NYISO's Extraordinary Corrective Action.
Interventions and protests are due by November 26, 2001. (EL02-16-000)

-	On November 16, 2001, NYISO filed a request for a stay of the Commission's decision to require the NYISO to re-bill for operating reserves for March 2000, pending the NYISO's appeal of that decision.  In March 2000, NYISO made an ""exigent circumstances"" filing seeking the imposition of various bidding restrictions to prevent alleged market power abuses.  The Commission's order only partially granted NYISO's request, and did not allow NYISO to re-calculate March 2000 operating reserves prices.
The Commission has not yet issued any notice of the filing.

If you need further information please contact me.

"FW: Implementing PJM WEST","fyi

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	owner-dfwg@nerc.com@ENRON   On Behalf Of MABRY@pjm.com
Sent:	Monday, November 19, 2001 7:15 PM
To:	dfwg@nerc.com
Subject:	Implementing PJM WEST

As we have discussed on our conference calls, AP will be joining PJM WEST on
January 1, 2002.  The formation of PJM WEST will result in two Control Areas
being operated as a single market under the PJM umbrella.  As such, PJM will
become the Security Coordinator and Transmission Provider for AP.  Additionally,
AP will no longer be a valid source or sink; PJM will be the source/sink.

In order to avoid potential validation errors with the Book of Flowgate, the
following implementation strategy is proposed to transition the Book of
Flowgates and the IDC base case from their present configuration to the
configuration required for PJM WEST.


Before January 1, 2002:

Step 1)  In the Book of Flowgates, add ""PJM"" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider to all flowgates that presently have ""AP""
listed as a Control Area.

Beginning 1/1/02, PJM will be the Security Coordinator for AP.  For system
reliability it will be necessary for PJM to have the ability to call TLRs on AP
flowgates.  Adding ""PJM"" to these flowgates provides for a smooth transition
across the changeover period of late December and early January.  This should
not cause OATI validation problems as both 'AP' and 'PJM' are entities
registered control areas


On January 1, 2002:

Tags with 'AP' as either the Source or Sink will be denied; PJM is now the valid
source/sink.


After January 1, 2002:

Step 2)  In the Book of Flowgates, remove AP flowgates from ECAR area and add
them into MAAC area.  Flowgates get new MAAC region numbers.


Step 3)  In the Book of Flowgates, remove ""AP"" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider to all flowgates where PJM was added as
such in Step 1.


Step 4)  In the IDC base case, move the 'AP' area into the 'PJM' area.


Step 5)  In the NERC Registry, remove ""AP"" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) U.S. Petroleum Refining Industry Can
Expect a 5% Growth in 2002 for Capital and Maintenance Spending, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 26, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (industrial Information Resources
Incorporated: Houston ). According to the recently released 2002
Industrial Outlook, the U.S. Petroleum Refining industry is expected
to see an increase of 5% in annual capital and maintenance spending
for 2002. This increase in spending is partially a result of
environmental compliance issues requiring refineries to produce
cleaner fuels and reduce Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP's).
	   The spring and summer of 2001 brought unusually high gasoline and
crude oil prices, delaying many planned maintenance turnarounds.
However, in the late summer and early fall of 2001, the high prices
retracted which led to the acceleration of many of the late fall
planned turnarounds. 2001 capital spending focused on the
implementation of new technologies and process changes to increase
product yields. With a less than optimistic outlook for margins in
2002, spending could likely be isolated to environmental and
maintenance programs for the coming year. These topics and more are
included in the recently released 2002 Industrial Outlook published by
Industrial Information Resources and available on CD-ROM.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and database for the energy and
industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the petroleum refining industry as well as

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

"Virtual Bidding (VB) Seminar - Friday November 30","
AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

We'll be running the third training session on Virtual Bidding on Friday,
November 30. This course is valuable to everyone involved in our energy
markets -- not just to those bidding ""virtually"". We fully booked our
previous two sessions, and this will probably be our last VB program this
year. Therefore, if you haven't attended so far, we suggest you give this
serious consideration.

The program covers:
     NYISO Bidding Fundamentals - an optional overview of the NYISO
marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Virtual Transaction bid entry & billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions


We start the program with an optional 75-minute Introduction to the NYISO
and LBMP. This opener provides some basics on power systems and how we
operate the New York electric marketplace. If you're new to the electric
business, or at least to New York's market, we think you'll find it very
useful.

On the other hand, if you're familiar with our operation (other than
virtual bidding), you probably don't need the introductory. It's an option
intended to help newcomers get up to speed for the rest of the program,
which focuses on Virtual Bidding topics.

Our registration desk will open at 8:00am and remain open all morning.
The introductory starts at 8:30 am.
If you don't want the introductory, just show up for the Virtual Bid
portions, which will starts at 10:00 am.

The program will be conducted at the Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road,
Albany, New York.
Register for the seminar through our web site at:
http://www.nyiso.com/services/training/cinfo/index.html
Details are included there.

Hope you can make it on the 30th to discuss this exciting new aspect of the
two settlement system.

Juan,

Thanks for your contact information.

Virtual bidding is separate from bidding and scheduling physical energy.
Your virtual bid is not required to be tied to a generator or physical
transaction. The limit to your virtual bid is the amount of credit
established for the purpose of virtual bids.

Additionally, I would like to arrange some time to come and visit you in
Houston. We are hoping for 2 or 3 hours on Monday, Oct 22. I'll be making
the trip with Frank Francis, who is the NYISO customer rep for Enron Power
Marketing. We have already contacted Paul Thomas at Power Marketing, who
may be contacting you about this trip. Perhaps it will be practical to meet
with both Energy Service and Power Marketing at the same. Frank and I will
plan to have the entire day available to meet with you and Power Marketing.
If you prefer to conduct the meetings separately that is also perfectly
acceptable to us.

Thanks,
Dave Evanoski

Dave,

one more question I forgot to throw at you during our conversation......
is ""Virtual Bidding"" going to take the place of the bidding (or
scheduling) process in place today.... or is it going to be a second
mean of bidding...?

I appreciate your help.  Look forward to working with you.

Juan

Imagine having an IQ that's off the  charts -- a real superbrain! You wouldn't have to worry about grades because you'd ace every course.  As a matter of fact, you'd probably be teaching classes instead of attending them. But how would you  fit in at school or with your friends? Oftentimes, people with exceptional intelligence struggle to  be accepted and understood because of their nontraditional thinking. Nobel Prize winner, John Nash,  whose life is portrayed in the movie ""A Beautiful Mind,"" is a good example of how challenging the  life of a genius can be.

"RE: Who is in Control?","
""May, Tom"" <Tom.May@ENRON.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As usual, Joe has cut directly to the issue and I could not agree more.
While there has been progress made in New York, the NYISO and the New
York market will never gain credibility or the confidence of the market
as long as these situations exist.  While the NYISO may not have the
ability to unilaterally change this, they would at gain some credibility
if they were the ones raising the issue and aggresively and publically
advocating for change.

"NE HRLY DEALS 10/15 THRU 10/19","
Paul,

Attached is a spreadsheet with the deals for HRLY NE for 10-15 thru 10-19.  It appears that most of the deals are financial deals done at R1E (Westhub), R1C (NY West), and R1B (Nepool).  These deals all have financial true-ups that come through in the financial liquidations line on your P&L.  I have tried to break the liquidations values down deal by deal.  When looking at the deals, please note that the liquidation amounts are the opposite value that they appear on the spreadsheet.  For instance, looking in the highlighted yellow column, the value should be the opposite value shown.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,

The settlements curently posted for September 28-Version 2 & 29-Version 1,
2001 are not accurate due to problems encountered with some data files for
those dates.  As a result, some customer balancing energy is incorrect and
residual adjustments for those dates are artificially inflated.  The NYISO

"FW: NYISO Order approving extension of automatic mitigation procedures subject to conditions.11/27","Earlier today, FERC issued the attached order approving an extension of the NYISO's Automated Mitigation Procedures (also known as the AMP or Circuit Breaker) through April 30, 2002, rather than until October 31 as had been sought by the ISO. Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISO's request. FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that addresses FERC's concerns with the AMP as well as FERC's concerns regarding how the ISO's overall mitigation measures work together. This proposal is due by March 1, to be effective May 1. 
 
FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already committed to fix: limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail the impact test, and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless thee is a demonstrated  market power concern. In addition, FERC directs the ISO to work with market participants to (1) examine whether the AMP may serve as a barrier to entry for new generation, and whether such new generation should be exempted from the AMP; (2) examine whether other energy limited resources, including those constrained by environmental rules, should be exempted from or accommodated in the AMP. Currently, only hydro units are exempted because their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market power. FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as well; (3) file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how the AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in effect or proposed, including the in-city mitigation  measures. FERC is concerned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be inconsistencies and gaps; and (4) consider must-run  mitigation measures consistent with ISO-NE and PJM. Again, FERC seems to be concerned here with transmission constraints within NYC. (Note that the Con Ed distribution system is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the out-of-merit calls in the City.)  Finally, FERC cautions the NYISO that it expects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process, and it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its March 1 comprehensive mitigation plan.

New York Independent System Operator, Inc.                        Docket No. ER01-3155-000
 
ORDER APPROVING EXTENSION OF AUTOMATIC MITIGATION PROCEDURES SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS
(Issued November 27, 2001)
On September 28, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) filed, pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), [1] a request to extend the termination date for the Automated Mitigation Procedures (AMP) [2] to 
October 31, 2002.  The Commission's June 28, 2001 order [3] in this proceeding approving the AMP required those automated procedures to expire on October 31, 2001.  In this order, we accept NYISO's proposed extension of the AMP until April 30, 2002, and we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that addresses the Commission's concerns with the AMP set forth in this order, as well as our concerns regarding how NYISO's overall mitigation measures work together.  NYISO is directed to file the comprehensive mitigation proposal by March 1, 2002 to be effective May 1, 2002.  The Commission's action here benefits customers by protecting them from market power, while establishing procedures to modify and improve the AMP mechanism, as well as other mitigation measures in NYISO.
 
 
 


I.  Procedural Background
 
In a November 23, 1999 order, [4] the Commission accepted in part and rejected in part the market monitoring and mitigation plans filed by NYISO.  In instances where NYISO concludes that a specific market participant is exercising market power, the Commission accepted NYISO's proposal to allow it to engage in discussions to resolve the issues informally or issue demand letters requesting the participant cease certain behavior.  In addition, the Commission stated that NYISO could file on a case-by-case basis under section 205 of the FPA to impose specific mitigation measures, or to make such filings based on recurring types of conduct that warrant mitigation.  However, the Commission did not allow NYISO to reduce bid flexibility, impose financial obligations to pay for operating reserves, or impose default bids, because this would give too much discretion to NYISO in price-setting and other similar regulatory functions without Commission review.  The Commission determined that NYISO had not described with sufficient specificity the types of conduct that would trigger the imposition of these measures; it had not established specific thresholds or bright line tests that would trigger the conclusion that market power had been exercised.
 
In a March 29, 2000 order, [5] the Commission further clarified NYISO's authority under the plans.  Among other things, the Commission accepted the specific thresholds proposed by NYISO to trigger possible mitigation, but rejected NYISO's proposal to keep them confidential.  The Commission also allowed NYISO limited discretion as to when to mitigate (e.g., NYISO may choose not to impose mitigation if it is satisfied with the party's explanation for its behavior) and for how long, but required NYISO to clarify that mitigation for market power may be imposed only prospectively. 
 


In a complaint filed in Docket No. EL01-55-000, the Mirant Companies (Mirant) alleged that NYISO improperly intended to implement the AMP without filing any changes to the MMM pursuant to either section 205 or 206 of the FPA.  In its May 9, 2001 order on Mirant's complaint, [6] the Commission found that part of NYISO's proposal is within the bounds of its existing tariff, in that section 3.2(b) of the Market Mitigation Measures (MMM) specifically envisions use of the Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) [7] to identify questionable conduct.  However, the Commission also found that NYISO's AMP proposal needed to be examined in greater detail before it could be approved.  Further, the Commission noted that section 205(c) of the FPA requires that NYISO keep on file with the Commission ""practices and regulations"" affecting its rates, and that NYISO's tariff did not contain language adequately specifying the timing and the process that are contained in the AMP.  Accordingly, the Commission concluded, that if NYISO wishes to implement its AMP proposal, it must file revised tariff sheets pursuant to section 205 of the FPA to set forth the AMP procedures.  In that filing, the Commission added, NYISO must address the concerns raised by the parties in the Mirant complaint proceeding, including: (1) whether the AMP provides sufficient opportunity for meaningful consultation; (2) whether inaccurate market-clearing prices will result even if the party whose bid was improperly mitigated is ultimately made whole; (3) whether the AMP would establish a new $150 threshold that never appears in the MMM; and, (4) whether NYISO proposes to exclude hydro units, imports, and exports from the AMP.
 
On March 17, 2001, in Docket No. ER01-2076-000, NYISO filed a new Attachment H to its Services Tariff which incorporated the proposed AMP procedures (March 17 Filing).  By order issued June 28, 2001, [8] the Commission accepted NYISO's March 17 Filing allowed NYISO to implement the AMP mechanism for 2001 summer capability period when supplies may still be tight and when the effectiveness of new demand response mechanisms are uncertain.  The Commission viewed the proposed mechanism as only a temporary solution, and agreed with certain of the intervenors that the proposed AMP may mitigate bids in situations where market power is not the cause for high or volatile bids, and may not provide for sufficient consultation with generators to reasonably establish that particular bids were attempts to exercise market power.  The Commission further explained that automatic market power mitigation may be most appropriate where it is tied to structural market power problems, such as must-run situations where generators would otherwise be in a position to name their price, and noted that both PJM and ISO-NE use this more limited approach to automatic mitigation.
 
 


II.  NYISO's Market Mitigation Procedures, Including AMP
 
          Under Commission orders allowing NYISO to implement its MMM, [9]  NYISO's Market Monitoring Unit (MMU), in consultation with NYISO's Market Advisor, is responsible for monitoring the markets administered or controlled by NYISO and for mitigating a market party's conduct when NYISO determines that market power has been exercised.  The MMM has specific threshold values for identifying generators or transmission facilities that exercise market power.  NYISO imposes mitigation when a market party's conduct has a material effect on prices or on guarantee payments.  Conduct and impact criteria must be satisfied before NYISO may mitigate a generator's bid.  NYISO may not mitigate market prices retroactively. 
 
Under its manual procedures, prior to implementation of the AMP, NYISO is able to identify conduct and pricing impacts that exceed the MMM standards only after the SCUC runs for a given day-ahead market have been completed, which means that mitigation cannot be implemented until the next day's day-ahead market.  The primary purpose of the AMP is to eliminate the one-day lag inherent in the manual application of the market mitigation thresholds that currently exist in NYISO's market mitigation.  That delay can be important when market conditions arise that permit an exercise of market power.  The AMP procedures are activated when the SCUC that calculates day-ahead market prices makes a preliminary determination that prices in a given area of New York will exceed $150 absent mitigation. [10]  Once the AMP is activated, it only mitigates bids if specific thresholds for both bidding conduct and market impact are crossed.  The conduct and impact thresholds used by the AMP are the same thresholds approved by the Commission under NYISO's Market Mitigation Measures.  Under the automated procedures of the AMP, non-competitive bidding behavior is still mitigated prospectively, as authorized in the MMM, but the mitigation will occur within the SCUC runs in which the conduct and price effect thresholds of the MMM are crossed, without the one-day delay that occurs under the manual procedures. 


III.  This Filing
 
On September 28, 2001, NYISO filed to extend the AMP, which would otherwise expire on October 31, 2001, until October 31, 2002. [11]   NYISO requests waiver of the 60-day prior notice requirement to permit a November 1, 2001 effective date.  NYISO states that good cause exists for the waiver in order to prevent a gap in the availability of the AMP.
 
NYISO believes the performance of the AMP was consistent with its design, which is to eliminate the delay of one Day-Ahead Market cycle inherent in manual application of the market mitigation thresholds.  NYISO explains that during Summer 2001, prices hit the $150 level 12 times, but the AMP imposed bid caps only four times.  Of those four times, the largest average number of megawatts mitigated was 481, while customers were protected from more that $11 million in unwarranted energy costs.  NYISO further states that only twice did AMP mitigation apply to more than one entity in one zone.  NYISO concludes that while the AMP is an automated procedure, it does not automatically apply bid caps whenever prices are high.  
 
Absent mitigation, NYISO states that significant unwarranted wealth transfers from buyers to sellers could take place especially during high-load summer months when supply may be tight.  NYISO asserts however, that transmission constraints can create tight market conditions in small areas even during shoulder months.
 
NYISO states that the conditions necessitating the need for the AMP are almost certain to be present this coming summer as they were this past summer, and with the potential for market power problems to arise in shoulder periods as well, it is preferable to keep the AMP in place while improvements are implemented and additional analysis under taken, rather than to summarily terminate the AMP.
 


NYISO states that the AMP, while working as intended, is subject to improvements.  Specifically, NYISO states that it intends to make two improvements in the AMP prior to Summer 2002.  The proposed modifications will have the effect of narrowing the scope of the AMP to mitigate prices only when market power exists.   First, NYISO proposes to exclude from mitigation by the AMP a Market Participants' bids that trigger the conduct test for mitigation if the total quantity of those bids is 50 MW or less, unless analysis shows the relevant units are in a position to exercise market power at those quantity levels.  At present, the AMP excludes bids by bidding entities with 50 MW or less of capacity.  NYISO stated the reason for exempting such bids was because the withholding of such small amounts will rarely have a material effect on prices.
 
Second, NYISO proposes to limit mitigation to zones in which the price impact test for mitigation is met by implementing at least one additional AMP pass in SCUC.  This proposed change would fine-tune the application of the AMP to limit mitigation to the specified zones and hours where the price impact test is met.  At present, under the AMP, all bids subject to the AMP, that exceed the conduct thresholds in the areas where zonal prices exceed $150, are tested for their impact on prices in a single SCUC pass.  If the price impact threshold is exceeded in any hour or any zone, the results of the mitigated pass are used to determine the Day-Ahead prices.  The proposed modification will appropriately exclude mitigation from occurring in those areas or hours where the price impact test is not met.
        
NYISO states that it will be working on correcting other minor flaws [12] in the AMP and that it is committed to working with Market Participants to determine if other refinements or changes in the AMP design should be considered.
 
IV.  Notice of Filing and Pleadings
 


Notice of NYISO's filing was published in the Federal Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 51,650 (2001), with comments, protests, and interventions due on or before October 19, 2001.  Motions to intervene were filed by Constellation Power Source, Inc., et al.; HQ Energy Services (U.S.) (late); the Member Systems; [13]  NRG Companies; and the PSEG Companies.  Motions to intervene and comments in support of NYISO's filing were filed by the City of New York; Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (ConEd); the New York Consumer Protection Board (Consumer Board); the New York State Public Service Commission (New York Commission); and the Multiple Intervenors.  Protests and motions to intervene were filed by Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation, et al. (Aquila);  Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. (Dynegy); The Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA); Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (Enron); The Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc. (Independent Producers) ; KeySpan-Ravenswood, Inc. (Keyspan) (late); the Mirant Companies, et al. (Mirant); and Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company (Williams). 
 
Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 C.F.R. ? 385.214 (2001), all the timely motions to intervene are granted and all late motions to intervene filed before the issue date of this order are granted.  Granting late intervention at this stage of the proceeding will not disrupt the proceeding or place additional burdens on existing parties.
 
On October 31, 2001, the New York Commission filed a motion for leave to answer the protests and comments.  Although Rule 213(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 C.F.R. ? 385.213(a)(2) (2001), generally prohibit answers to protests, we will accept the New York Commission's answer because it helps clarify issues under consideration in this proceeding.
 
Intervenor Protests and Comments
 
Five parties, as identified above, support NYISO's proposal.  New York City believes that the extension of the AMP is a necessary (but not sufficient) measure for mitigating excessive prices.  It maintains that the AMP does not adequately protect New York City consumers from excessive wholesale prices because it sets too high a trigger for implementing the mitigation, noting that the AMP was not triggered on August 9, 2001, when day-ahead energy prices reached a record $1024/MWH in New York City.  Similarly, ConEd believes that the AMP remains necessary to prevent or identify and mitigate the exercise of market power in New York's day-ahead market.  It asserts that extending the AMP will permit NYISO to assess further the coordinated operation of the various mitigation measures that it administers. 
 


The New York Commission asserts that the AMP is needed throughout the year,  focuses only on high prices caused by market power, and has not unreasonably disadvantaged generators.  It also believes that the AMP complements but does not duplicate the in-city mitigation measures, remains necessary despite price-capped load bidding and virtual bidding, and conforms to the Commission's preference for ex ante mitigation.  The Consumer Board maintains that the fundamental rationale for the AMP has not changed, the AMP is working as intended and has not unduly interfered with the performance of competitive markets, NYISO has committed to make improvements in the AMP before next summer.  The Multiple Intervenors also agree that the AMP is necessary to prevent the exercise of market power and believe that the Commission should encourage NYISO to continue to improve the AMP.  
 
Eight parties, as identified above, filed protests concerning NYISO's proposal.  Mirant asserts that NYISO has not shown the AMP is needed or addressed the flaws in the AMP identified by the Commission.  It also states that the AMP resulted in the improper mitigation of economically justifiable bids during the 2001 Summer Capability Period and is likely to harm consumers by discouraging efficient supply-side and demand-side decisions.  EPSA and Williams make similar arguments.  EPSA further asserts that mitigation measures should not be a part of the discussions to form a Northeastern RTO.  The Independent Producers maintain that the AMP is flawed because it improperly mitigates bids that do not cross the impact threshold required for mitigation, and because it mitigates a generator's bids for quantities that are not large enough to represent an exercise of market power.  They further state that some units were improperly mitigated as a result of flawed calculations of reference level curves, that the AMP has not been tied to structural market power problems, and that the AMP improperly inhibits ICAP generators from managing their risk by choosing whether to sell in the day-ahead or in the real-time market.  Enron supports the protests of EPSA and the Independent Producers.
 
Aquila makes many of the arguments described above and also asserts that NYISO's AMP extension request ignores the improvements in market conditions that have occurred over the summer of 2001.  Aquila maintains that at a minimum, the Commission should deny NYISO's request to continue the AMP, without prejudice to a subsequent filing by NYISO that address the flaws with the current version of the AMP.  Keyspan suggests as an alternative that the AMP should only be extended until April 30, 2002, and only if the 50 MW exemption is extended, the consultation process is revised, a structural power screen is added, and a firm timetable for completion of the items discussed in NYISO's filing is provided.   
 


In addition to arguments made by other protesters, Dynegy asserts that the AMP has not worked as designed, and that on August 9, 2001, 22 of its day-ahead market bids for August 10 for its Roseton Units 1 and 2 had been mitigated.  Dynegy maintains that these should not have been mitigated since they did not cross the ""conduct threshold"" in NYISO's MMP, and that Dynegy still has not received a direct explanation from NYISO as to why its bids were mitigated, although recent NYISO reports and statements indicate that a mistake was made with respect to Dynegy's bids.  Dynegy states that an explanation of the performance of the AMP was provided in a memorandum (now available on NYISO's website) made available to those that attended a joint meeting of the Scheduling & Pricing Working Group and the Market Structures Working Group held on October 9, 2001.  According to Dynegy, at that meeting, NYISO claimed that the AMP worked as designed since the coding for the computer programs worked as intended, although certain upstream data inputs caused Dynegy's bids to be improperly mitigated.  Further, Dynegy asserts that NYISO has dropped the $100 million day price spike (June 26, 2000) as justification for the AMP and now concedes that the price spike was due to seams problems.
 
Answers 
 
In its answer, the New York Commission reaffirms its support for the proposed extension of the AMP until October 31, 2002.  The New York Commission states that the AMP is necessary to ensure that wholesale prices are just and reasonable in light of the tight supply situation and transmission constraints that continue to exist in New York.  
In response to the arguments presented by the generators opposing the extension of the AMP, the New York Commission submits that: the AMP adequately distinguishes between high prices associated with market power and high prices associated with scarcity;  the AMP properly evaluates the combined impact of generators; and the AMP is needed through the year, not just during the summer capability period during high load periods, given transmission constraints and scheduled and unscheduled outages during shoulder months.  Finally, in response to generators' concerns that the AMP may mitigate in certain situations where mitigation should not have taken place, the New York Commission says that it is just as important to protect against the occurrence of market power that goes unmitigated should the AMP not be extended.  Absent the AMP, the New York Commission states the harm of permitting unmitigated market power would be far greater than any harm caused by improper mitigation.  The New York Commission compares the $11 million withheld from generators as a result of the AMP being in effect during Summer 2001 with the $100 million resulting from a single day of unmitigated market power in 2000.
 
V.  Discussion
 
NYISO has proposed to extend the same AMP the Commission approved in the June 28 Order, without modification.  NYISO states that it is committed to making further refinements to narrow the impact of the mitigation performed under the AMP and states it is committed to making what it refers to as two major improvements prior to Summer 2002:  limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless there is a demonstrated market power concern.                                             
 


Our review of the AMP indicates that it appropriately attempts to distinguish between  market power and scarcity.  The AMP closes the one day lag inherent in the manual application of mitigation measures in the current MMM and thus advances the ability of NYISO to mitigate market power.  Implementation of the AMP is not without concerns, however.  The AMP, as noted by NYISO and other market participants, requires some refinements and additional review, e.g., determination of Reference Prices, unnecessary mitigation, application to energy limited resources.  
 
Also, AMP may be one of the many barriers to entry for new generating facilities.  We direct NYISO to work with market participants, especially the New York Commission, to examine barriers to entry for new generation.  As part of this process, the NYISO may consider exempting new generators from AMP in its March filing.  We note that generators in PJM have an exemption from must-run mitigation.  If NYISO chooses to exempt new units, NYISO should address whether the exemption would encourage more rapid entry of new generators and the effect of such exemption would have on NYISO's comprehensive mitigation proposal.
 
NYISO proposes to exempt hydro units from the AMP.  NYISO believes that hydro units should not be subject to such mitigation because their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market power.  The Commission believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources, including those constrained by environmental rules.  Therefore, we direct NYISO to work with market participants to determine whether there are other energy limited resources and to develop an appropriate accommodation within the AMP procedures.  This coordination should develop both standing protocols as well as an accounting for possible day-to-day considerations affecting bids.                                                                            
 
Accordingly, we will extend the AMP until April 30, 2002, subject to the following conditions.  We note that NYISO has already indicated that it is committed to working with market participants to determine if other refinements or changes in the AMP design should be considered.  We direct NYISO meet with market participants and to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which addresses the Commission's concerns expressed in this order concerning the AMP, as well as explain how AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in effect or proposed for NYISO. [14] 


In this regard, we note that NYISO has several mitigation measures in place or proposed, including its existing MMM and its proposed AMP, as well as  In-City mitigation.   We are concerned that these measures may not fully fit together in a way that adequately addresses market power problems while avoiding unnecessary mitigation.  On the one hand, these measure may not mitigate all significant exercises of market power.  For example, the existing MMM allows suppliers to exercise market power for one day before mitigation goes into effect.  On the other hand, other measures may create the potential for unnecessary mitigation. 
 
We also direct NYISO to consider must-run mitigation measures consistent with ISO-NE and PJM.  The  In-City mitigation measures address market power problems created by transmission constraints into New York City, but not those created by transmission constraints within New York City or elsewhere.  PJM and ISO-NE both have mitigation measures which provide for automatic mitigation in defined must-run situations.  
 
Accordingly, we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal by March 1, 2002 to be effective May 1, 2002.  When developing a comprehensive mitigation plan, NYISO should bear in mind that the Commission expects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process. Therefore, we strongly urge NYISO to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its comprehensive mitigation plan. 
 
The Commission orders:
 
(A)  NYISO's request to extend the AMP is granted until April 31, 2002, subject to the conditions set forth in the body of this order.    
 
(B) Waiver is granted to permit the proposal to take effect November 1, 2001.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


(C)  NYISO is directed to file a comprehensive proposal for mitigation as discussed herein on or before March 1, 2002 to be effective May 1, 2002.
 
By the Commission.

This is a purchase from DP&L for 50 MWh HE 11 - 23 at a PJM W Hub index price.  It is not in the hourly P&L and not routed in scheduling.  I am getting word from the counterparty that it did not happen.  Can you shed some light so we can settle with DP&L?

Paul - 

This is a purchase from DP&L for 50 MWh HE 11 - 23 at a PJM W Hub index price.  It is not in the hourly P&L and not routed in scheduling.  I am getting word from the counterparty that it did not happen.  Can you shed some light so we can settle with DP&L?

Thanks,
Marci

"April 2000 Version Mapping","
JDavies@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear NYISO Customer:

The version mapping that was posted to the web on 06/08/2001 was created
from a customer file that joined
the NYISO on April 11, 2000.  This resulted in the mapping not being valid
for any customers that were already
qualified for the entire month of April.

For all customers that were qualified customers for the entire month of
April 2000, the following mapping applies:

Date Current             Previous

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"ENA Gas Structuring","
In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  ""Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season,"" says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  ""Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions.""

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the
2001/2002 Winter Assessment is shown below.  A copy is also available on
the following NERC web site:

NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  ""Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season,"" says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  ""Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions.""

""Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform
reliably,"" he added, ""although some transmission congestion is expected
during the course of the winter.""  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

For a copy of the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment, visit NERC's web site at
(http://www.nerc.com).  NERC's web site also includes information on the
electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to ""keep the lights on"" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.
