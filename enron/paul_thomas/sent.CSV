"Trading Limits","While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW.  If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position.  If you have any questions please let me know.  

I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack... then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.

Paul,

Attached is a spreadsheet with the deals for HRLY NE for 10-15 thru 10-19.  It appears that most of the deals are financial deals done at R1E (Westhub), R1C (NY West), and R1B (Nepool).  These deals all have financial true-ups that come through in the financial liquidations line on your P&L.  I have tried to break the liquidations values down deal by deal.  When looking at the deals, please note that the liquidation amounts are the opposite value that they appear on the spreadsheet.  For instance, looking in the highlighted yellow column, the value should be the opposite value shown.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

Subject:	NYISO - Weekly Update 6/8/01

Attached FYI is the weekly update prepared by the NYISO. In addition, several noteworthy actions were taken at Wednesday's Management Committee meeting:
ICAP: Culminating an 18-month effort that I have been chairing, the MC gave final approval to two fundamental changes to NY's ICAP market, that, if approved by FERC, would go into effect on Nov.1, 2001, with the start of the winter capability period. The first changes the nature of determining the product to be bought and sold from one based on tests results (ICAP) to one that includes, as an element, a unit's forced outage rate (referred to as unforced capacity or UCAP). The design adopted by NY is very similar to the accreditation system that has been used in PJM for many years.  It will reward units that are more available than the average unit in the state, and incent the below average units to improve their availability. The second major change adopted moves NY to a monthly procurement requirement for loads. The current requirement is six months at a time. The change should facilitate customer switching under retail access programs and avoid the experience just witnessed in upstate NY for this summer capability period, where 1400 MW of load were deficient and got stuck paying a huge deficiency price for the entire six month period. Under the revised program, load could cover their positions month by month. This latter change was approved by the MC over the objections of the PSC and certain utilities, who continued to argue that any change to the current ICAP rules may damage NY's reliability. 
Penalty and Public Disclosure Provisions: In a surprise vote, the PSC-led effort to get the MC to approve additions to the ISO's Market Mitigation Plan that would add penalty and public disclosure provisions for parties whose bids are mitigated by the ISO was defeated when only 55% voted for the measure. (A 58% vote is required for passage.) An earlier version of the proposal had been passed by the MC but had been rejected by the ISO Board because it applied only to suppliers and not to all market participants found to engage in behavior detrimental to the market. The PSC-led effort to respond to the Board's concerns apparently caused enough supporters of the original version to change their vote this time around. Whether this effort is resurrected again (by the PSC/utilities or the Board itself) may hinge on what FERC decides with respect to the circuit breaker proposal pending before FERC. The ISO Board has made clear it wants something in effect this summer to help it  manage price spikes.
Unbundling of Schedule 1 Charges: Efforts to finalize the unbundling of the ISO's fixed schedule 1 charges (nearly $100 million a year) were sent back to a working group for further work. However, the direction to be taken for some issues appears clear. 
TCCs: We succeeded in convincing the group that no costs should be assigned to existing TCCs, and that if costs are to be assigned to this market, they should be allocated on the basis of the relative price paid for the TCCs compared to the annual auction revenues, rather than on the basis of number of TCCs purchased.
Exports and Wheelthroughs: We succeeded in getting a separate category created for these transactions that will result in $/MWH costs that are much less than what is currently charged. Conversely, there is now likely to be a small charge on imports into NY; however, since all generation will be hit with this charge, it should be reflected in everyone's bids equally and simply passed on to the loads through the market clearing price.
The exact amount of these various charges will depend on resolution of a number of issues including whether the TOs should be assessed a portion of the ISO's overhead right off the top.

I have had a request and I also think it is a good idea to put the regional gas price for the following regions.

PJM - Transco Zone 6 Non New York
NY - Transco Zone 6 New York
NEPOOL - Algonquin

The heat rates would then be calculated off the appropriate regional gas price.

Paul,

As we discussed in our recent phone call, my recommendation is to attend
the course, because the level of detail will be far greater than we in the
Customer Relations department can provide. I have tentatively reserved a
conference room at the Power Control Center for 4 pm, on Oct. 15th if you
are able to make it. I've also invited  F. Francis to join us. Please let
me know if you will be able to meet at 4pm, or some later time.

Also, I spoke with Juan Padron this morning and firmed-up our plans for
Frank and I to visit you in Houston on the 10/22. We will plan to be in
Houston for whatever hours are convenient to meet with you and Juan on that
day. I suggested to Juan that if there are any issues that you would like
us to address during the visit, just let us know ahead of time so that we
may prepare.

Thanks,
Dave

Dave,

I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I
was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and
Frank are coming to Houston the next week.  Basically, do you think that
you can give us the same information that the course would while you are
here?  Please let me know.

Thanks,

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes
Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation, in an Advisory
by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston): The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants, which
could represent part of the answer to world's power generation needs
over the next 30 years, has taken a few steps forward in the
consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months.
However, nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental
groups and those involved with post-Chernobyl public health concerns.
	   The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) from Eskom in South Africa
continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry
regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the
modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and
appropriate.
	   Stakeholders in the project include the U.S. company Exelon with
12.5%, Eskom with 30%, British Nuclear Fuels with 22.5%, Industrial
Development Corporation of SA with 25%, and Black empowerment at 10%.
Currently, Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of 40 PBMRs
at a price of around $6 billion (USD). Early in 2001 the company
requested the U.S. National Regulatory Commission to start laying the
groundwork for PBMR licensing.
	   Exelon would like to see the $300 million demonstration unit,
which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model, to show
that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety,
efficiency and viability are proven enough for U.S. regulatory
agencies to proceed forward with licensing. The plant is to be built
alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape
Province of South Africa with work commencing in 2003. If approved,
Exelon may then start concurrent construction of U.S. sites to bring
PBMR-generated power to market at the earliest possible date and at
the best price. Specifications and claims by Eskom, who purchased the
technology after a 21-year development and proving period in Germany,
present the PBMR as small, safe, clean, cost efficient, inexpensive
and adaptable.
	   The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in
graphite to form a fuel sphere (60mm in diameter). The PBMR design
makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a
closed cycle gas turbine and generator. The design differences between
the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a
safe and economical power plant.
	   The annual world market for power generation is estimated at $70
billion. The PBMR, if it comes through its regulatory trials, would be
in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action. With 10%
of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black
empowerment shareholders, 10 plant export orders a year could
contribute nearly $1 billion a year to South Africa's Gross Domestic
Product and another $1 billion in export income. An estimated 57,000
direct and indirect jobs would be created. These figures would double
and triple for 20 or 30 orders annually. If the demo plant achieves
its targets, Eskom will place an order for 10 modules, with the Exelon
order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the
first U.S. plant in 2007.
	   Eskom will sell PBMR's as a manufactured item with no rights
given. Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured
reactor and 20% site construction related. The aim is for 40% of the
sourcing to come from South Africa. Taxpayers money (approximately $50
million so far) is being spent by the South African authorities in
giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the
project before the ""go"" decision is given. With this right and proper
concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the
130MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of
nuclear power generation.
	   The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their
ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a
significant move. A contract has been placed (in mid-January 2002)
with the U.S. company Stone & Webster and South African construction
company Murray & Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman
Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project
in engineering, procurement, construction management and project
management. Following this development, the PBMR management at Eskom
have gone on record to state that with the multi-national and
multi-disciplinary support now providing leverage, the approval
hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of 2002
given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the
government.

"RE: ISG","Gary,

We spoke last week about opportunities that your company currently has open.  Currently, I am making markets on Enron Online for the PJM cash and term off peak market.  In addition, I still manage the Northeast Physical book for the Northeast (PJM, NYISO, and NEPOOL) and manage the Northeast real time trading desk.  I also have participated in the PJM FTR and NYISO TCC market in my tenure here at Enron.  
The opportunities that I would most be interested are those located here in the Houston area.  My second choice would then be those positions located in Florida.  I look forward to talking to you soon.

Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by
New York State Regulators

(London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's
leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State
Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as
complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long
Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's
formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580-
megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks-
off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.

International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy
facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of
New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the
State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses
all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project,
including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.

""The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long
Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power,"" said Peter
Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. ""We are planning to
begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and
expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004,"" he added.

Notes to Editors-

The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of
industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66
and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven. When
completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million
homes. The project will also result in additional significant benefits to
the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.

International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric
generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net)
under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development.
Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are
Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic,
Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand. International Power was
created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading
independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock
Exchange on 2 October 2000. The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges
is ""IPR"".

 government taxes you to the point you have to sell both
 to support a man in a foreign country who has only one
 cow, which was a gift from your government.

 CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell

The FTR market is fast emerging among traders in the PJM market as a reliable means of hedging the transmission risk associated with power deals.  Some players have even found opportunities for speculative trading in these markets.  Whether you're a veteran player in the FTR market, or are just beginning to consider how participating in the market could help your trading, PowerSurge's FTR module provides you with the information and tools you need to answer your questions about the FTR market.

 

1.  How are my FTRs doing?

If you're already participating in the FTR market, this tool will give you a daily display of how your FTRs are doing.  By tracking the day ahead LMPs and FTR market clearing prices PowerSurge can tell you whether or not your FTR option is in the money.  Similarly, you can use the FTR tool to find out how your competitor's FTRs are doing. Go to the PowerSurge FTR Module:

2.  What is this FTR worth?

PowerSurge's FTR module can also help you determine what to pay for an FTR.  By compiling all of the historical pricing information on FTRs, PowerSurge allows you to see how the market has valued these FTRs in the past, as well as how they have actually performed.  This is an easy way to find undervalued FTRs for speculative trading, or simply determine what to bid on an FTR, whether it be in the auction or in the bilateral market.  This pricing information in combination with the physical power information (current and historical congestion, and scheduled transmission outages) contained in FriedWire's Traffic Report, provides traders and schedulers with a wealth of information for valuing FTRs.  Go to the Traffic Report:

<http://www.friedwire.com/common/jsp/login/login.jsp?loginto=TRAFFICREPORT&gotohref=/trafficreport/frontpage/fwwelcome.jsp>

Who's Got What?

PowerSurge's FTR module summarizes FTR information by Source, Sink, Path, and Owner.  The FTR owner summaries allow you to keep track of every FTR in your own company's current portfolio as well as keep tabs on what your competitors' holdings are.

Hi Paul,
I'm so sorry, I thought your phone number was on this message but now that I
looked at it further it's not on here.

I was just notified by management that we don't have the Flair collection.
We have regular Bernhardt but not this one.

My apology for the inconvenience this might cause.

I researched all the errors and they were deal entry problems on the scheduler or trader's side, not program errors.

I think is looks good and can be moved into production.

We will have to watch it closely for a while and the might be some small changes or enhancements, but overall I think it is done.

I will get together with the schedulers and traders sometime today to show them what to do.

Thanks for all your hard work.

12:24 16Aug2001 RSF-Canada blisters under ""year with too much summer""

    By Kanina Holmes
    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadians, sometimes divided by regional differences, economic disparities or linguistic snits, find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon -- a national drought.
    From Atlantic to Pacific, from the Arctic to the U.S. border, most of the world's second-largest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades.
    ""In many ways, this drought is the same tune that's being played right across the country. It's a different look, different season and different impact, but nevertheless, everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country,"" said David Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.
    Whether it's fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec, barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario, many will remember the summer of 2001.
    ""It'll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think. Too much excess and not enough normal,"" said Phillips.
    In parts of British Columbia, water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winter's record low snowfall in the mountains.
    ""We've had normal summer in terms of rain. But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble,"" said Jim Mattison, Water Management Director for B.C's Bureau of Sustainable Resources.
    But the devastation is most apparent in Canada's breadbasket, the Prairies. Many farmers, especially in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, have already written off their crops.
    ""I've been here since '63. I have never in my life, ever, seen anything like this,"" Norman Stienwand, a farmer in Castor, Alberta, told Reuters.
    ""IT'S BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION""
    ""There's no water. The grasshoppers are so bad. It's beyond your imagination,"" said Stienwand who farms 1,080 hectares (2,700 acres) of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle.
    It has been so sweltering in his region, located about 160 km (100 miles) west of the Saskatchewan border, that some of Stienwand's farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock.
    ""It's just going to destroy a lot of farmers. They're just not going to come out of it,"" he said.
    In June, the Alberta government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds, and, as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested, many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality.
    Last week, the Canadian Wheat Board, the marketer of western Canada's wheat, durum and barley crops, forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports.
    In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see.
    ""You wouldn't be able to fill a sardine can with the rain they've got since the twenty-second of June,"" said Phillips.
    The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontario's soybean crop.
    ""I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I don't see it. It's just really, really, really dry,"" said Debbie Yuck, a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks.
    ""When they come on (the radio) every morning and say it's a beautiful sunny day, great to be at the cottage, I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours,"" said Yuck.
    Canada's largest city, Toronto, has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog, with temperatures soaring as high as 37 C (99 F). Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards.
    An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer.
    ""THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER""
    ""I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling,"" said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters.
    ""I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer.""
    The hot, dry spell could be a blow to the national economy. By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops, aiding farmers, battling forest fires and generating more electricity, it could run into the billions.
    Quebec's multibillion-dollar agricultural sector, which accounts for some 16 percent of the Canadian industry's revenues and produces 38 percent of the country's milk, has also been hard hit since early July.
    In southern Quebec, where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity, vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sun-ravaged crops.
    ""The farmers are on the edge of burn-out, they can barely stand up,"" said David St-Cyr, a spokesman for Quebec's powerful Agricultural Union.
    The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat, the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that, for weeks, have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north.
    Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on Prince Edward Island, growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop. Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins.
    ""I think there are a majority of Canadians, probably, who can hardly wait for the winter. And I never thought I'd ever hear that,"" said Phillips.

I understand there was a problem on my desk this week with a market that was
posted and executed on by one of our traders. I was not in the office and a
decision was made for the trade to stand.

I apologize if there was a lack of professionalism at this end. We do a lot of
business with Enron and  I am interested in keeping a working business
relationship.

Please include me in any discrepancies with our real-time traders and their
accounts: pplhourly(1-8).

A small deal,as I see it you owe us a jab...and I won't be asking for any
favors any time soon.

I spoke with David Lawrence.

  Subject: Do you remember this?  Ollie made the headlines in
  1987 and was laughed at by the News Media.

 IT WAS 1987!

 At a lecture the other day they played an old video of Lt.
 Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
 Reagan administration.

 There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree.
 But what he said was stunning!!
 He was being drilled by some senator; ""Did you not recently spend close
 to $60,000 for home security system?""

 Ollie replied, ""Yes I did sir."" The senator continued, trying to get a
 laugh out of the audience,"" Isn't this just a little excessive?"" ""No
 sir,"" continued Ollie.

 ""No? And why not?"" the senator asked.

 ""Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir.""

 ""Threatened? By whom?"" the senator questioned.

 ""'By a terrorist, sir."" Ollie answered.

 ""Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?""

 ""His name is Osama bin Laden sir."" Ollie replied.

 At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but
 couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A
 couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

 ""Why are you so afraid of this man?"" the senator asked.

 ""Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know
 of,"" Ollie answered.

 ""And what do you recommend we do about him?"" asked the senator.
 ""Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that an
 assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
 the earth.""

 The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that
 was shown of the clip.

 If anyone is interested, the Senator turned out to be none
 other than Al Gore.

13:39 20Aug2001 RSF-ANALYSIS-Brazil energy diet slims utilities' accounts

    By Andrei Khalip
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The latest corporate results by Brazilian power utilities provided only a glimpse of the impact of energy rationing that started in June, but enough for analysts to say the sector is probably the most hard-hit by Brazil's economic woes.
    Coupled with a sharp depreciation of the real currency, which has lost about one-fourth of its dollar value so far this year, and an overall economic slowdown, power rationing should hammer energy companies further in coming months.
    ""Although the currency's depreciation was the main culprit of poor results in the second quarter and first half, power rationing has already shown its face,"" said Oswaldo Telles, power sector analyst with BBV Securities.
    ""And it will get worse for power utilities this quarter.""
    The government was forced to resort to tough power rationing in June, ordering Brazilians to knock 20 percent off their usual power consumption, in order to avert crippling blackouts amid an acute power shortage.
    Brazil is dependent on hydroelectric plants for over 90 percent of its electricity. Two years of drought and full use of power stations' capacity to feed a growing economy dried up reservoir levels and triggered the worst energy crisis in at least 30 years in Latin America's largest country.
    Rationing, due to last at least until November, means lower sales and revenues for power firms, while their costs and dollar-denominated debt get inflated by the real's losses.
    ""It's only the beginning of rationing, but it gives us an idea of how power utilities, distributors in particular, will be affected,"" said Eduardo de la Pena of Banco Santander. ""I think we can say that they are suffering the most.""
    Out of electricity sector stocks, most analysts only have a buy recommendation for Copel <CPLE3.SA> of southern Parana state, where there is no energy shortage and no rationing.
    GOVERNMENT HELP SOUGHT
    Among the big losers in the past six months were Sao Paulo's Cesp <CESP4.SA> utility whose losses rose sharply and   Eletropaulo <ELPL4.SA>, controlled by US-based AES Corp. <AES.N>, which posted a net loss after a year-ago profit.
    Rio de Janeiro's power distributor Light <LIGH3.SA> last week posted its biggest half-year loss ever of 431 million reais ($172 million) and Light officials said the company should suffer big losses this year with revenues falling at least 10 percent due to the rationing program.
    The main problem for companies is that the government fixes electricity prices in Brazil -- even though most distributors had long been privatized -- and allows the adjustments to compensate for higher costs only once a year.
    ""This year, their costs grew so violently that when the adjustments came it was about time to adjust tariffs again,"" said Telles. ""But they just have to wait till next year.
    Analysts said the only bright spot may be that the government will allow companies to start adjusting tariffs twice in one year. There are rumors of such a change although analysts recognize such an unpopular measure would be difficult in the run-up to presidential elections next year.
   In an ironic twist, power distributors are now spending money on lawyers to defend in court the government's order for power switchoffs for quota-busters -- the measure that effectively slashes their revenues.
    In the meantime, the companies are banking on an obscure contractual clause, known as Annex V, that should compensate them for lost revenue due to rationing. Some have even booked that gain in the latest results, although the government has so far not confirmed that it will pay.
    ""Annex V is the biggest question for power firms. If there is no compensation, they are screwed,"" said another analyst.

They're unusually high due to the increase in deal volumes as well as inflated prices due to extreme heat (08/06 thru 08/10 in particuar).

Andy. We have received an RFQ for the subject  Plant. As mentioned to Alice
this morning it would not be possible to come up  with firm numbers for the
system by Friday. Do you need firm proposal or budget  pricing?
Further, Water Control Associates (WCA) would offer  an alternate side
stream system to that specified.
It would not make sense to supply tanks piping etc  from US sources for a
project in Italy. What  Water Control Associates could do is create the
design and specify the equipment  required to be primarily sourced in
Europe. For a cooling tower project in Chile  for Kvaerner (Vancouver) we
did just that, where some equipment bought by  Kvaerner came from USA and
other materials locally in Chile. WCA have a system  operating in Turkey.
Please refer the web page www.uswca.com.
Before we can go any further, please  reply.

pmorrison@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the MIS, OASIS and BAS that will be
implemented on May 29, 2001.

* Changes will be made to the Market Information System (MIS) to
make in-hour curtailment prioritization of transactions more
consistent with the BME scheduling process. Specific changes will
be made to:
- the NERC / ranked ordering,
- the addition of message for ICAP recall,
- the exclusion of Federal contracts from ICAP transactions
  recalled, and
- the inclusion of exports from LBMP reference bus as ICAP
  transactions.

* Also, for a transaction with an external source, the decremental
dollar will no longer be calculated. Please see Technical Bulletin
#61 for more information regarding transaction curtailments.

http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/techbulletins/index.html

* Changes will also be made to the MIS to remove the $20,000 bias
from day ahead external transactions.

* New data will be posted to the NYISO OASIS web site to enhance
the presentation of real time data. The elements being added to
the web site include zonal real time (5 minute) load values and
zonal forecast load values. Consistent with a resolution passed by
the Business Issues Committee (BIC), zones J & K will be combined.

* The Shared Activation of Reserves (SAR) package on the real time
system will be enhanced to accommodate support for Hydro Quebec
(HQ) wheel-through transactions.

* The NYISO Day-ahead Price Responsive Load Program will be
implemented in both the MIS and the Billing and Accounting (BAS)
systems. The Day-ahead Price Responsive Load program offers
NYISO Customers the ability to supply a bid to the MIS indicating
the cost at which it will reduce its demand by a specified number
of MWs. The program will make use of the existing bidding and
scheduling web pages and upload / download templates.  However,
you must register for this program. Contact your Customer
Relations representative for details. Documents containing
instructions with more details will be issued soon.

* Other changes to the Billing & Accounting system (BAS) will
incorporate changes to the Daily Advisory Statements that will
provide additional columns of information on the Power Suppliers
section of the advisory. Also, new CSV reports will be provided
that give more detailed load information and static sub-zone
definition. More information will be provided soon about a
software tool to filter this new data.  It will be provided for
Market Participants whose automated data retrieval systems are not
prepared to receive the revised Daily Advisory statement.

Change #'s:
SWHE-4WQLHZ; KKIR-4WQLHE; VLEE-4WQQGL; RDEY-4WTLS6; DCUK-4WRGYU

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate with
us about these changes.

Thank you,
Customer Relations

"RE: Hello","Well Aaron,
It is great to hear that you are doing well.  

Yes, Raquel and I ( the same gal I was dating at Genesis) ended up tying the knot in late April in Rio.  We got married in small church on the Lagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.  Above the church sat the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.  My parents, family and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!

We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.   I too have learned a lot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to enjoy.  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.  We are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much longer we will live there. Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it off.  

As far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.  I imagine we will have one in a year or so... right now we are enjoying taking vacations on a whim.  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.  Not such a bad place to be stuck.  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.  It is different from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome, London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a city settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the white sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!! 


Take care and have a great Christmas.

Paul

Subject:	Re: Hello

Hi Paul:

How have you been?  How is Enron treating you?, well I hope?

Yeah, we moved to Lyon at the beginning of 2000.  When looking at a map of
our solar system, Lyon is practically in the center of France.  We're more
or less located at the foot of the French Alps.  At about a million people,
Lyon is smaller than Houston.

Because of the Internet Boom, my Internet investments appreciated enough to
buy us an apartment in an old neighbourhood located in the center of the
city.  We've been renovating it ever since.  I've learned a hell of a lot
about working on homes!

Before David Underwood got fired he told me that you got married and bought
a house in or near Linkwood (off Stella Link).  I imagine you married that
young Brazilian lady that you were dating while at Genesis?  F?licitations!
Have you been to Brazil?  I'd like to see it one day if ever the opportunity
presents itself.  Since you're hitched now, I guess you are obligated to
have children soon. :)

So yes, since the 22nd of September I've been the proud father of a baby
girl -- Camille.  She's a real angel and quite a character too (read
rascal).  I hope Enron allows you to receive e-mail attachments that are not
work related because I've attached a photo of her that is as recent as
tonight.  She's got brown eyes like her mommy.

I heard you went to NYC.  How did you like it?  I love NYC and I was just
there one week ago!  No matter how many times I go there I will never run
out of things to do.  This last time I saw an exhibit on Brazil at the
Guggenheim.  There are still a number of museums and neighbourhoods that
I've not seen so I know I will return.  Actually, I ponder the idea of
getting a small apartment there so that we can go and soak up a little
American culture for six months at a time (NYC is only six hours from
Paris).  Since Camille is American, I think this would be good for her.  Of
course the problem is the price of an apartment.  It's bloody expensive,
mate.  (Stress BLOODY)  I asked one agency and they told me $450,000 for a
studio apartment in a nice area on Manhattan (I don't know how accurate this
off-the-cuff quote was).  That's a little too much for me unless I get a
mortgage which I horror the idea of owing any bank money.  Perhaps something
cheaper can be found in a crack neighbourhood.  You know, the ones with ugly
whores hanging around every small street intersection.  Then there's Harlem,
maybe I can get a pad next to Clinton's.

June 10th, 2000, we got married for a second time.  The marriage was in
France and all my in-laws attended as well as my mother and aunt too.  They
(my mother and aunt) were a little shocked to say the least.  They speak no
French and were like fish out of water (to say the least).  But you didn't
hear this from me.

I've tons of little day-to-day stories that are worth a laugh but this
e-mail covers all the big stuff that's been happening.

Best Regards,
Aaron

Paul,

I spoke with David Lawrence.  He did indicate that there would be slide presentations available prior to the meeting with which conference-call participants could use to keep up but acknowledged that attendance would probably be more effective.  I'd suggest talking with Dana about the prospect of attending.

Tom--let me know what you'd prefer & if Dana wants Paul to attend we can make arrangements together (as long as I don't have to share a room with Paul).

Paul:

The estimated trans loss charges for August have been entered (NE Hourly # 700778.3 @ ; NE Phys # 700783.3).  They're unusually high due to the increase in deal volumes as well as inflated prices due to extreme heat (08/06 thru 08/10 in particuar).  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to come by and discuss with me or Rebecca.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

"RE: Data Problems","David,

Diana Allen and the IT team are currently working on resovling the bad Zone P day ahead and real time data.  Diana told me that it was pulling the PJM data.  

As far as the shift notes go:
I talked to Rob Benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly.  The PJM summary page is pretty accurate (usually w/in 50 cents of the actual number).  The link for the spreadsheet is:  http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/summary/pjmsummary.aspx  .. you might have been using an old version.  

I will continue to manage the Northeast physical book.  It allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market. 

Paul.

While writing the e-mail Diana said that she fixed the Zone P problem.

Subject:	Data Problems

Paul,
I have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at.

1.  The number Mother data is pulling for Zone P is wrong.  The pointer for the data can be found on the SQL worksheet the expression is:
	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'DAYAHEAD', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_DA,
and	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'HOURLY', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_RT,

I have looked at the PJM and NY prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from.

2.  The other 24hr desk evidently has been told that the PJM night shift is to prep the PJM and Nepool portions of the shift notes.  That is fine with me.  I wrote a macro to pull, format and print the Nepool information.  The PJM information is not available on the website.  The East power portal has something.  I think it does some kind of Op Sum pull at some unknown interval.  The problem is the information is not accurate.  

Rob Bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other 24hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting.

2.a All data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata.  This makes me doubt that opsum is the source, as edata also pulls from opsum.

2.b When all interfaces and hubs are printing the same, the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website.  I have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right.  If the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at ""M:\Electric\24hour\PJM AVE\PJMSummary.exe"".  If they could fix this app I would care less about the web site.  If they do not want to fix the app I can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template.  I don't really care how I get the data, I just need to get yesterday's PJM for the shift note.

In other news, if you are trading some of the regular products, are you following the DA-RT physical moves?  If we do man the 24hr desk (even if Bryce is the day guy) we could cover the DA-RT physical.  Having it part of the 24hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the NY side in the early morning.

I only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading PJM to spend the same amount of time on the analysis.  It is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift.  Just a thought.

Thanks,
David

Participants who now use EES and will use CSS are encouraged to attend one of
these workshops.  The dates for the workshops are: May 31 at 10:00 a.m., June 5
at 2:00 p.m. or June 11 at 2:00 p.m. The workshops will be presented on the

registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.

14:54 20Aug2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report

    By Marianne White
    QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the ""precarious"" status of French in North America, Quebecers should have their own citizenship, a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday.
    But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship, the report added.
    The goal is to make everyone, including new immigrants, English-speaking residents and native peoples, feel that they are part of Quebec, a French-speaking island in an English-dominated North America.
    ""We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society,"" said the chairman of the task force, Gerald Larose, a trade unionist who favors Quebec's separation from Canada.
    ""As far as language is concerned, living in Quebec is not like living in Canada,"" Larose added.
    The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship, saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation.
    ""We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message,"" said Diane Lemieux, minister responsible for the French language, adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy.
    The language task force, which crisscrossed the predominantly French-speaking province, which is three times the size of France, over the past 12 months, unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday.
    It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French, a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments.
    The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French, and says that if they fail they should not be hired. It also proposes increasing teaching hours for French, delaying the introduction of English teaching in schools by several years, and protecting the rights of Quebecers to work in French.
    About 82 percent of Quebec's six million people describe French is their mother tongue. French has been Quebec's official language since 1974 and by law must dominate commercial signs, although other languages may also appear. Quebec has 1.4 million people whose first language is not French.
    Language can be an emotional and divisive issue in Quebec, which has held two referendums on separating from Canada. In the last one, in 1995, Quebecers voted to remain in Canada only by a razor-thin margin.
    English and French have been Canada's two official languages since 1969, with both languages spoken widely throughout the nation's history

Paul,

During testing of the NYISO Deal Upload I noticed that there are many hourly deals in Enpower for the same NYISO Transaction ID.

Please tell your guys that if this is going to work there can only be ONE deal in Enpower for EACH NY trans id.

__

The testing is almost complete - as it stands now the upload can be used for NE-PHYS deals (I have updated 6/1-6/18), but until we resolved
The problem mentioned above it can NOT be used for HRLY-NE deals.

There are still some enhancements needed for error/warning processing and reporting and researching.

Thanks,

Rebecca

Willis Philip and I are scheduled to arrive in Albany around 2:45 PM on Oct. 15.  That should give us time to meet you there by 4 pm, however, if we should be delayed I will give you a call.  I appreciate you taking time to show us around your facilities.  

Furthermore, we can all meet together when you come on the 22nd.  That should enable us to cover all the issues without redundancy.  I will talk to with Juan to firm up the exact meeting hours so that we can have an agenda for the day.

Paul,

As we discussed in our recent phone call, my recommendation is to attend
the course, because the level of detail will be far greater than we in the
Customer Relations department can provide. I have tentatively reserved a
conference room at the Power Control Center for 4 pm, on Oct. 15th if you
are able to make it. I've also invited  F. Francis to join us. Please let
me know if you will be able to meet at 4pm, or some later time.

Also, I spoke with Juan Padron this morning and firmed-up our plans for
Frank and I to visit you in Houston on the 10/22. We will plan to be in
Houston for whatever hours are convenient to meet with you and Juan on that
day. I suggested to Juan that if there are any issues that you would like
us to address during the visit, just let us know ahead of time so that we
may prepare.

Thanks,
Dave

Paul,

We have already finalized Sept. P&L....our deadline was 5 p.m. yesterday.  Therefore, any changes from what was issued yesterday will simply come back to you in a flash adjustment at the end of this month or the following month.  Its possible that price revisions occurred which were not picked up by the download in Enpower.

Thanks.

Casey,
I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.

Your final showed $341,000.

Please give me a call.

"RE: Hello","Aaron,
The house we live in is about 1700 Sq foot.. older home that needed some fixing up.  At the time I thought we paid too much, however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home.  The Houston Texans (a very original name) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake.  Also, they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare. The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood!  However, home values go up and down just like the stock market.  Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there.

When we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare, I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job.  I prefer to do it myself, I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper.  One day the contractor almost died in the house... he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach.  He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week!  He ended up returning and finishing the job?!?!  Anyways, I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done.  It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at Enron.  All in all, I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors.  

Talking about wild flowers and plants.. the same is true for Costa Rica.   Plants that only grow indoors with great care in Houston grow like weeds in Costa Rica.  I recommend that on your places to go list.

Merry Christmas, Feliz Natal, and Feliz Navidad
Later
Paul

Cher Paul:

That sounds like a nice marriage.  When we got married it was nothing
extraordinary, just a small and informal marriage celebration.

Yeah, I know Braeswood and Buffalo.  I'm sure you paid a pretty penny for
the neighbourhood -- it's a nice area.  We've done horrendous amounts of
work to our apartment.  We are doing something like a loft with it and we
had to gut it by removing most of the walls and floors, etc.  Soon we will
be putting in a mezzanine floor (it's a trendy thing here).  We had two huge
bins full of debris in front of our home for about a week!  Artisans in
France don't like working very much and when they decide to work they do
just enough of it to get by so customers are very unsatisfied when they are
finished.  Inevitably, the customer must always bargain the price down at
the end because more artisans must be hired to come in and finish all that
which was not done.  It's a hell of a mess but to be fair the same problems
exist in the States it's just that I've never owned a home before.  In the
end I decided it's much easier and faster to do it yourself and bypass the
contractor all together.  Plus you can do a much better job yourself!

Yes, I need to go to Rio.  I've been to Hawaii and to date it is the most
beautiful place I have ever seen.  Waikiki has exotic flowers -- that cost
$15 a piece anywhere else -- growing on the sidewalks like any ordinary
flower!!!

BTW, I was thoroughly impressed with Yosemite.  I've been trying to plan a
vacation back there ever since we left.

Kudos,
Aaron

Well Aaron,
It is great to hear that you are doing well.

Yes, Raquel and I ( the same gal I was dating at Genesis) ended up tying
the knot in late April in Rio.  We got married in small church on the
Lagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.  Above the church sat the
giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.  My parents, family
and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!

We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.   I too have learned a
lot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to
enjoy.  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.
We are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much
longer we will live there. Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it
off.

As far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.  I imagine
we will have one in a year or so... right now we are enjoying taking
vacations on a whim.  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for
week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.  Not such a bad place to be
stuck.  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.  It is
different from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome,
London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is
one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a
city settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the
white sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!!


Take care and have a great Christmas.

Paul

   Subject:  Re: Hello

   Hi Paul:

   How have you been?  How is Enron treating you?, well I hope?

   Yeah, we moved to Lyon at the beginning of 2000.  When looking at a map
   of
   our solar system, Lyon is practically in the center of France.  We're
   more
   or less located at the foot of the French Alps.  At about a million
   people,
   Lyon is smaller than Houston.

   Because of the Internet Boom, my Internet investments appreciated enough
   to
   buy us an apartment in an old neighbourhood located in the center of the
   city.  We've been renovating it ever since.  I've learned a hell of a
   lot
   about working on homes!

   Before David Underwood got fired he told me that you got married and
   bought
   a house in or near Linkwood (off Stella Link).  I imagine you married
   that
   young Brazilian lady that you were dating while at Genesis?
   F?licitations!
   Have you been to Brazil?  I'd like to see it one day if ever the
   opportunity
   presents itself.  Since you're hitched now, I guess you are obligated to
   have children soon. :)

   So yes, since the 22nd of September I've been the proud father of a baby
   girl -- Camille.  She's a real angel and quite a character too (read
   rascal).  I hope Enron allows you to receive e-mail attachments that are
   not
   work related because I've attached a photo of her that is as recent as
   tonight.  She's got brown eyes like her mommy.

   I heard you went to NYC.  How did you like it?  I love NYC and I was
   just
   there one week ago!  No matter how many times I go there I will never
   run
   out of things to do.  This last time I saw an exhibit on Brazil at the
   Guggenheim.  There are still a number of museums and neighbourhoods that
   I've not seen so I know I will return.  Actually, I ponder the idea of
   getting a small apartment there so that we can go and soak up a little
   American culture for six months at a time (NYC is only six hours from
   Paris).  Since Camille is American, I think this would be good for her.
   Of
   course the problem is the price of an apartment.  It's bloody expensive,
   mate.  (Stress BLOODY)  I asked one agency and they told me $450,000 for
   a
   studio apartment in a nice area on Manhattan (I don't know how accurate
   this
   off-the-cuff quote was).  That's a little too much for me unless I get a
   mortgage which I horror the idea of owing any bank money.  Perhaps
   something
   cheaper can be found in a crack neighbourhood.  You know, the ones with
   ugly
   whores hanging around every small street intersection.  Then there's
   Harlem,
   maybe I can get a pad next to Clinton's.

   June 10th, 2000, we got married for a second time.  The marriage was in
   France and all my in-laws attended as well as my mother and aunt too.
   They
   (my mother and aunt) were a little shocked to say the least.  They speak
   no
   French and were like fish out of water (to say the least).  But you
   didn't
   hear this from me.

   I've tons of little day-to-day stories that are worth a laugh but this
   e-mail covers all the big stuff that's been happening.

   Best Regards,
   Aaron

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Hoon,
I just looked at the Bernhardt website and I didn't see the style we want, but
they had on the catalog at the Noel store.

the style is CATALINA - two love seats and a wage (the middle part) and it comes
w/ 4 pillows
the fabric is FLAIR - on the sofa the code is 7063-010
                 - on two pillows the code is 7143-032
                 - on two pillows the code is 7132-002

Noel's price - $5228 with delivery included

I would like two or three more pillows, depending  on the additional cost.


Let me know what Louis Shanks and the other place  says about it!

Love
me

Sorry.. I sent it but the file is too big..

You can find it @ M:/power2/analyst/PJM/NYISO Map.ppt(close to that name)

It should be the only powerpoint file in there.

Hey Paul,
I know you're busy, but can you let me know where to find the map detailing the Northeast transfers limits you included in the presentation you put together for Dana.
I'd like to include it in a presentation I'm putting together for John Llodra.
Thanks,
Max

Kim, we would like to extend a formal offer to Reagan J. Mathews who is currently working for Enron Broadband.  Please forward the formal documentation to Reagan so that the transfer to East Power can take place.

TJ, if you could find out who Reagan's assistant and HR representative are and fax the documentation to the appropriate persons so that he can join our group.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Paul
