We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

Today,  we were both OOMC'd and OOME'd  for 135mw's for the entire day.      The OOME instruction was a category 4,  which means operate AT this level.
We sold an additional 85 mw's from the plant,  bringing the total to 220.
Ercot called to tell us to drop the output of the plant to 135.     I hesitated because of the confusion we have previously experienced with this product.

I contacted Mark Patterson and discussed the category 4 requirements and I agreed to take the plant down.
Colleen at Ercot said that she was going to ""report me"" for not immediately complying.    Am I in trouble?

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Frontera position for tomorrow","

I have sold Frontera a financial swap for $28.50 for hours ending 7-12.    The first 3 hours are for size (300 mw's).  
I would buy hours 7-9 tomorrow for up to $20.      I could buy up to the 300 mw's.     Schedule this to load in the North.
I could also use 200 mw's for he 10 and 150 mw's for he 11.

Calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 7-9.

If you have questions,  please give me a call,  as this is a very important issue.

Words of advice:

Dont go into the market with a $20 bid for 300 mw's.   Quietly accumulate these mw's if possible.     Do not tip your hand on this deal,  as that would contribute to spiking RT prices.

Thanks,
JMF

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Short for this evening","

Due to Oklaunion being down  for maintenance,    we are being cut again on offpeak schedule #570719.     This 25 mw purchase from Tenaska needs to be replaced for hour ending 23 and 24 today.     Buy the power tonight  and enter deal under Ercot Mgmt book, as this is Doug's power.
I have already made the cuts in Enpower for both hours ending 23,24 and tomorrow.

For tomorrow,  I have purchased energy for this schedule,  so we dont have to worry about it on a real time basis.

If you have questions,  let me know.

Thanks,
JMF

"FW: VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR TOMORROW!!!","We have had a major scheduling mishap.    When trading for the position listed below,  we cut or increased EPMI  resource to balance the pool, rather than taking length that you purchased to load.      I wasnt aware that this was a point of confusion.  Also,   City of Austin was adjusted each hour, even though it was to be a mismatch schedule.
Mismatches dont consider volume,  it is essentially zero.
We purchased a sizeable qty of mw's yesterday and because we didnt schedule it all to load,  we wont be paid the balancing energy price,  which was large.
If no EPMI load exists on the obligation side,  then create it.

The EPMI resource represents Frontera's generation- dont play with it, unless directed to do so.

If you have questions,  please dont hesitate to ask.   

Also,  dont wait until after your shift to reconstruct Enpower.   It is not going to be accurate because it wont be fresh on your mind.    It takes twice as long after the shift to enter your deals because you are tired.

Please ask me questions about the financial swap and how we are going to work together to make some serious money.

Subject:	VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR TOMORROW!!!




Item One
The Frontera Plant is scheduled to sell 450 mw's for tomorrow.   I sold them a financial swap @ $24 for the whole day.   For the first part of the day we will be running extremely short.   We will just  that we are having problems coming up.
This is the amount that will be short:

he7 - 420 mw's
he 8 - 420 mw's
he 9 - 420 mw's
he 10 - 315 mw's
he 11 - 230 mw's 
he 12 - 22    100 mw's


I would like you to buy power for 7-11 for alot less than $24.    If you cant,  then we will take the imbalance price.   If you do buy,  purchase under the Ercot Asset book and schedule to South Zone load for the Ercot Asset book.   If you have questions,  call me.



Item Two

I purchased 99 mw's from City of Austin for tomorrow,  hours ending 7-22 under the Ercot Asset book.  I sold this power to the ST ERCOT desk for $28.75.
This power can be rescinded intraday.    WE NEED TO CALL CITY OF AUSTIN TOMORROW WELL BEFORE FLOW AND TELL THEM WE ARE NOT TAKING THESE MW'S.   THEY SUPPOSEDLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS DEAL.   THEY ARE NOT TO GENERATE.     CUT DEAL # 849947 IN ENPOWER SCHEDULING AND REPLACE WITH PURCHASES UNDER ERCOT ASSET.
We will either purchase 100 mw's balday (well below $28.75) or take the pool price.
For the hours that are filled by the pool,  I need a purchase from Ercot Imbalance (under Ercot Asset book),  zero price and mk-mkt flag set to ""no.""


Obviously,   the market will be short tomorro, especially in the morning.   Purchase at least some megawatts for tomorrow,   but dont give away our position.
Maybe we could import from the East.  That would be great.    If you left us short for  100 mw's 12-22,  that would be cool.   We can take care of that.

FRONTERA NEEDS TO BUY 50 mw for hour ending 2300 to cover Mirant sale for the last hour.     Purchase under the Teco Service book and sell to Frontera under Teco Services book.   In Portal,  we would enter a purchase from X  and we should balance against an existing Mirant sale for hour ending 2300.   Cut the Frontera 50mw in the Portal so we will balance.

Call if you have questions,

JForney

 	 	    Dear Eric,  The Center for Strategic and International Studies is holding a daylong conference in Washington on Tuesday to address U.S./Canadian energy issues.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says a hot topic up for discussion is the proposed gas pipeline linking Alaska to the Lower 48.

We'll also have the latest fallout from the Enron collapse in Washington.

He'll talk about the decision to keep the Enron bankruptcy case in New York and Dynegy's concerns with the terms of the deal with UBS Warburg.  Catch Burns in the noon ET newscast - and other Enron-related stories from the Houston bureau throughout the day.   Raymond James & Associates' Jim Rollyson will also be in the Houston bureau on Tuesday.  Rollyson will discuss lower energy prices and how they might impact the economy.    Congressional Representative for Oklahoma and gubernatorial candidate Steve Largent joins us on Tuesday.  Rep. Largent will stop by ENL headquarters during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast to discuss his thoughts on whether he expects a comprehensive energy bill to be passed in the near future.

Some of the biggest companies in the energy business will be talking about the future of fuels and government regulation in the industry.

On Wednesday, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Houston) talks with the Houston bureau about energy issues around the U.S.  Also from Houston on Wednesday, Correspondent Kim Benestante reports on Texas Parks and Wildlife's ""Rigs to Reef"" program.

I hope you're all as excited as we are!  We're very
anxious to see everyone :-)

We have pondered the idea of the Bachelor/Bachelorette

together, rather than seperate.  So we hope you will
all join us on
Friday November 30th at 8:00 PM
655 Baker St. #BB103

We will meet there, then carpool/tailgate to the Four

drinks, desserts, and jazz.

Please reply and let us know you'll be coming.  We
hope to see everyone there!  :-)

"positions for Monday","

Due to the slowdown in trading,   I will be concentrating on leaving positions for RT to trade around.    
These will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility.    This will make more sense,  once you inherit the position.

The following positions need to be watched for monday:

1.     We are short to Mirant (on behalf of Frontera) for hour ending 6 only.     We need to buy 50 mw's and schedule this with Mirant Real Time.     
They are expecting and have agreed to this trade.   This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis.

If you are working Sunday night,   check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade.   It is very common that they get a bad ""handoff"" and are unaware of this transaction.     Give them plenty of time to work this out.

We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X  and a sale to Mirant.    In Enpower,  buy from X and sell to Frontera (under the Teco Services book).   Enter this as a flat transaction,  ie buy for $20 and sell to Frontera for $20.


2.    The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw's for offpeak Monday at $11.25.    Sell this or leave to the pool, as necessary.     I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10/16-19.     



I think that Saturday morning will come in strong, as we are getting some cooler weather.    I think also that some larger units are coming off line,  which will put upward pressure on the offpeak.


Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want.       Next day onpeak is trading for $20.5,  offpeak is trading $11.25.     
Where is the value???   Lets  trade it up!

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Senate Democrats introduced their comprehensive energy legislation on Wednesday.  The legislation differs significantly from the Republican energy bill that passed the House last summer, but the proposals share similar elements.  The Washington bureau will bring us more reaction on the legislation on Thursday.   Also from Capitol Hill, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee will look into the debate over Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards.  Democrats want to include a CAFE increase in their comprehensive bill.       Finally, Representative Joe Barton (R-TX) will join ENL to give us the details about his legislation on electricity restructuring, which is to be completed and introduced this week. Join us for the Rep. Barton interview on Thursday from the Hill.   ENL West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas wraps up her three-part series on geothermal energy on Thursday.  Kym tells us why Mother Nature is having trouble keeping up with demand at ""The Geysers,"" and what companies are doing to make geothermal production more efficient and reliable in Northern California.   Kym also reports live from Las Vegas Thursday and Friday at the Day of the Trader Conference.  Analysts and experts are expected to discuss Enron's demise and the potential impact on the markets.  Don't miss live reports from the conference tomorrow.   Members of Congress are expected in Houston on Thursday to question Enron executives.  The Securities & Exchange Commission is turning up the heat on the investigation of the former energy giant with lawmakers questioning whether new laws may be needed in the wake of Enron's implosion.  We'll keep you abreast of any Enron developments from Houston throughout the day.   The Houston bureau will also have the latest Thursday from the IADC/OOC Drilling Gulf of Mexico Conference 2001, including reports on the high-tech exhibits and discussion from leaders in the field of offshore drilling.  Join us for these reports from the Houston bureau.    Closing Prices for Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2001    Crude: $19.49/bbl -$0.16   Unleaded: $0.5420/gallon -$0.083   Heating Oil: $0.5314/gallon -$0.0104   Gas: $2.491/mmBtu -$0.072   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Eric,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.    Next week from the Washington bureau, we'll keep you updated on a new effort on Capitol Hill to rush energy legislation through Congress.  Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma is one of many making the push with hopes of attaching the comprehensive energy bill that has already cleared the House to a Defense Appropriations bill in the Senate.  If successful, the energy bill could be voted on as early as next week.   Next Wednesday marks the first FERC meeting for new Chairman  Pat Wood.  The Commission's last meeting was canceled due to terrorist attacks on Washington, D.C. and New York City.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will also meet on Wednesday to discuss possible legislation on securing the nation's energy infrastructure.  We'll have updates on these events from the Washington bureau next week.    Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will be covering the Houston Energy Dialogue 2001 Conference that begins on Monday.  The Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources is expected to be there along with other delegates from Indonesia.  Kim will bring us updates from the conference next week.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on U.S. rigs and how their numbers are down.  Raymond James & Associates John Tasdemir talks about the reasons for the low rig count next week.   Also next week from Houston, Stolt Offshore Vice President  Gordon Barksdale is penciled in to join us.  Barksdale will talk about the company's achievement of a high ""lay rate"" for a large diameter pipe on the Williams East Breaks pipelay project.    Finally from Houston, ENL's Gale Smith will bring us a report on a  Rice University program dedicated to studying solar weather.  Join us for these reports and interviews from Houston next week.   Spokesperson for CAL ISO Greg Fishman will talk about new agreements between the grid operator and renewable energy resources.  ENL's Kym McNicholas also says Fishman is expected to give a load and supply forecast for the month of October.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission is expected to vote on possible changes to the power plant siting process.  The changes could potentially give applicants a greater opportunity to communicate with the staff.  Kym will follow any progress from the Commission next week.   Kym will talk more with Phoenix Consulting Principal Susan Schneider next Tuesday.  Schneider will join us from the West Coast bureau to discuss her concerns with PG?Corporation and Pacific Gas & Electric Company's reorganization plan.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of every hour.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

Subject: Question for seller -- Item #1061862597


> Just wanted to let you know that while I have the highest bidding item,
you have what I believe to be the most valuable.  I was interviewed by CNN
yesterday and they asked me my perspective on all of these items.  I said
flat out that your item for the Chewy was MUCH more valuable than mine given
an insider's perspective...  That story is set to air on CNN sometime
between 6am and 9am tomorrow, Friday.  Hopefully they'll quote me correctly.
If so, your item should take off...
>
> Either way, good luck to you.

"Out of balance on 11/30","Eric,

You are out of balance for the 30th.  I assumed this was another cut deal, but I don't know who to enter a deal with you in EnPower.  This has resulted in approx. -$5k to your P&L today.  If you could fix this upon your return, the money will come back in your P&L at the end of Dec.

Thanks,

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"RDI Newsletter-The second edition of Inside RDI is now online!","
Valued RDI client,
 
Welcome to the second edition of Inside RDI, which you can access by clicking here. We've changed how we deliver this newsletter in response to your suggestions. More about that later. First, we'd like to tell you about some significant corporate changes at RDI.
 
We are pleased to announce the merger of two of the world's most respected energy information, research, and market services groups: Financial Times Energy (FT Energy, including the RDI and E sourcebrands), a unit of Pearson plc, has been acquired by Platts, the energy division of The McGraw-Hill Companies. The merger with FT Energy fits well with Platts' mission: to be the world's largest and most authoritative provider of information, services, and solutions for the energy industry.
 
Operating within Platts, RDI will maintain its commitment to its customers, offering data, geospatial, and consulting products and services of the highest quality. But combining our talents with Platts' considerable expertise will result in significant expansions of existing products and capabilities in the areas of news, price assessments, increased global support, and market analysis of the energy industry. 
 
In particular, Platts will augment RDI's database capabilities, mapping resources, and consulting services, providing a new level of analysis and insight. Furthermore, the merger with Platts will enhance RDI's ability to develop sophisticated new products and services. Just as in the past, should you have any questions about RDI database, geospatial, or consulting services, please direct your inquiries to RDI's Boulder, Colorado, office at 720-548-5000.
 
Inside RDIwill continue to provide assessments of the latest industry trends, explain how you can use existing RDI products more effectively, and keep you up to date on the new tools we're developing. Because we listen to your thoughts and suggestions, we've changed our delivery method with this edition of Inside RDI. As you've requested, you'll now receive bimonthly e-mail updates with a link that will allow you to download the publication on the spot. (Alternatively, you can visitwww.rdionline.comto download the most recent edition whenever you wish.)  
 
We hope you'll find Inside RDI to be a useful business tool. Your input is invaluable to us, because our goal is to make this newsletter serve your changing needs. Please don't hesitate to let us know what we can do to improve the publication. 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Heath Kucera

"Final Program Update Meeting - Tuesday, October 30","
Over the past few weeks we have held several ""Breakfast Club"" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The Department of Energy is hosting a conference on Clean Coal Technology on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future.  U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is among those scheduled to speak.   Look for energy legislation to move to the forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break.  Republicans in the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the chances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the year.   The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us coverage.   If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drastically increase production of ethanol.  On Monday, the Houston bureau's  Gale Smith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of making ethanol.  We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE.   A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers.  The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on Monday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is meeting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Resource Investment Plan.  The plan is due to the legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will hear a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Metcalf Energy Center.  After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker.    Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday.  He'll give us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the real problem behind Enron.  We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director  Mark Easterbrook is joining us.  Easterbrook will talk about the performance and outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs.  Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule for next week.  ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving market holiday.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  An extraordinary OPEC meeting begins on Wednesday and our International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will be live in  Vienna, Austria.  We'll have reports and live coverage from the meeting throughout the day and we'll bring you an update on a possible production cut.   In Washington, the Senate continues debate on an economic stimulus package.  The Senate version is missing some of the corporate tax relief measures in the House bill already passed.  In addition, Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says we could see a decision by Republicans to try and attach energy legislation to the bill as early as Wednesday.   The Washington bureau on Wednesday will bring us more reaction to President Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to capacity.  Peter says the move is being applauded by many on the Hill, but there are concerns that it could boost prices.   The Energy Information Administration releases its Annual Energy Outlook on Wednesday morning.  The Washington bureau will bring us the latest energy forecast for the nation tomorrow.   We'll be talking about pigs from the Houston bureau on Wednesday - smart pigs to be exact.  Paragon Engineering Manager of Pipeline Integrity Management Joe Killin will stop by to give us his take on the pipeline-testing smart pigs.  Killin says this technology may not be the best method of testing for a faulty pipeline. Check Killin out in the noon ET newscast.   Also on Wednesday, zed.i solutions CEO Keith Smith talks about a new product called the Smart-Alek.  The Smart-Alek allows producers to monitor the flow rate of gas wells from a remote location.     Finally from Houston, we'll have reports on Russian President  Vladimir Putin's speech at the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.  He's taking time out of his three-day visit with President Bush to discuss the energy industry.  We'll have this report and more from Houston on Wednesday.   During the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Chairman of the California Alliance for Distributed Energy Resources Jairam Gopal. Gopal will talk about more emissions standards expected to come from the California Air Resources Board this week.     We'll have a visitor from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.  Alaron Trading Vice President and Senior Market Analyst Phil Flynn will give us an overview of the API and DOE numbers and an outlook on new petrochemical contracts.  Log on during the noon ET newscast to catch Flynn.   From ENL Headquarters on Wednesday, Banc One Investment Advisors Managing Director Anthony Chan will discuss Federal Reserve Board policy.  Chan will give us his answers to the questions of where do we go from here, and does the Fed have any more room to move?  I'll talk with Chan during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.    Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Enron Challenge: The Race is on...","
Mike McConnell and Enron Community Relations is challenging Corp, EES, EGS (which includes ETS and Global Assets), and EWS to win the Race to Cure Diabetes.  

Which business unit  will sell the most shoes?

To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain or contact Janice Riedel at x37507.  The donation will represent a $10 contribution (with the company match) toward the research foundation.  Your shoe will be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26th.  Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Researchers are closing in on finding a cure.

The Cure for Juvenile Diabetes is within walking distance.

"food!!","
Hi eric, 
I just wanted to write and ask what type of foods you like to eat.  Especially breakfast foods.  I don't normally keep food in the house (and the food I do have is ancient and/or not that great - Ask Adnan!), so I wanted to know what you like so I can go grocery shopping and actually cook this weekend :-)   
Are you a simple guy, or are you a bit complex?  I only have cereal, which is what I eat daily.  But I'm sure you have different tastes. Adnan likes to have his coffee w/ a pastry on weekdays and banana pancakes w/ eggs, fruit and bacon on weekends, so I have that taken care of, but I need to know what you like.   
Another thing... We don't want you to worry about spending money on food.  You'll be well taken care of.  We won't let you go hungry.   
Anyways... hope your excited...  :-) 
Talk to you later, 
Maylynn

"New tool for hourly analysis","

Save the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.

You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following:
10/25/01
10/26/01

To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.


The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.

This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.

Let me know your feedback.

"Final Benefits Memo","
 
In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

"IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.","In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

"FW: ERCOT request","Eric:

Not sure if my original question re this request made it to you.  Do you want to make this change for all East off-peak products or just ERCOT?  Not really a big point since I view this as a clarification.

Eric Saibi (Off-Peak Trader for ERCOT) wants to change the last line in all the off-peak products to read ""Saturday or Sunday, or any day that is a NERC holiday"" from ""Saturday or Sunday,  including any day that is a NERC holiday"".  Can you please run it by legal and have it changed???  If you have any questions please contact Eric or myself.

Thanks in advance

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  On Monday, the Washington bureau will follow up on the President's new push for energy legislation in Congress.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Friday, we heard some of the President's strongest language to date, urging Democrats in the Senate to bring a bill to the floor.    There are also several energy hearings scheduled in Congress next week, including one on possible new limits on power plant emissions in the Senate and another on MTBE in the House. The hearings are some of the first to be rescheduled since the anthrax scare hit Congress earlier this month.   RDI Consulting Principal Mark Morey is penciled in from the Washington bureau on Monday.  He'll share his insight on where the emissions issue stands on the Hill during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Secretary of Interior Gale Norton was in Houston Friday at the IPAA conference.  On Monday Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us more from Secretary Norton on Lease Sale 181 and how drilling in ANWR will create thousands of jobs for Texans.     Noble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bureau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings.  The company reported very good earnings but Day warns that the fourth quarter may not be as good because of a weakening economy.  Join us for all the details on Monday.     ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Western States Petroleum Association Spokesperson Dave Fogarty next week.  Fogarty will discuss California's decision to ban MTBE by December 31, 2002 and whether the state is ready for this move.  Catch Fogarty from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday.    Former Governor Pete Wilson tells Kym he takes responsibility for signing the state's deregulation plan, but adds there were steps Governor Gray Davis could and should have taken to avoid what turned out to be an energy crisis.  Kym will have all the details on this story next week.   Finally from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to talk about the gas market during the noon ET newscast.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.  Have a fantastic weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the Energy Information Administration is set to release its Winter Fuels Outlook and Short Term Energy Forecast Thursday morning in Washington.  We'll bring you the numbers as soon as they're released and hear from acting head of the EIA on what they mean.   The House Energy and Commerce Committee will be very busy Thursday.  The Committee is expected to vote on whether to renew the Price Anderson Act, which would indemnify the nuclear industry in the event of a major accident.  The same Committee is also expected to vote on a resolution calling on the Bush Administration to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to capacity.     ENL's Gale Smith says we'll have more on the Gulfstream Natural Gas System on Thursday.  Gulfstream Communications Director  Chris Stockton talks about the joint development between Williams and Duke to create the largest system along the Gulf of Mexico.    Also from Houston, Energy Intelligence Group Bureau Chief  Barbara Shook will drop by on Thursday.  Companies like Enron were planning to offer multiple services online a couple of years ago.  Tomorrow during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast, Shook will ask the question, ""What ever happened to convergence?""   Finally from Houston, Texas City Sun Reporter Lora-Marie Bernard will join us on Thursday.  She'll discuss an internal state memo she obtained regarding toxic levels of benzene released from BP and Marathon Ashland refineries in Texas City.

 Investment Special  Tonight's Feature Company	
 ShareCom, Inc. (OTCBB: SHCC)  Current Price: $0.0063  52 Week High: $2.49 52 Week Low: $0.0062        Why SHCC?   SHCC has established business relationships with FEMA, the American Red Cross, AAA, NOAA, and more.   SHCC is currently booking revenues of $45,000 per month and projects revenues of $13 million for 2002.   On January 17th, SHCC showed its continued growth track through its new partnership with Maxwood Technology to produce breakthrough emergency broadcast products.   The Time is NOW at Sharecom  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Weather Service (NWS), the Red Cross and AAA are a but a few of the agencies and organizations with whom ShareCom Inc. has forged alliances to ensure clear competitive advantage for its product lines. The past 10 years have seen a dramatic increase in severe weather conditions, and with continued global warming these patterns will become worse. Prompted by FEMA and NWS aggressive programs, demand for the company's NOAA radios will soar.  Today 7% of American homes possess an NOAA radio.  The national goal is 100%.  Sharecom's www.WeatherRadios.com is the site for consumers to purchase the company's superior product at a significant discount. SHCC's revenue flow rate is at $45,000/month and rapidly growing. The Company will realize a profit this year and plans to triple it next.. SHCC's market dominance in this growing ""bread and butter"", niche business makes it an interesting acquisition candidate and a compelling investment.  This Just Out: SHCC NEWS     ShareCom Partners With Maxwood Technology to Produce Breakthrough NOAA Emergency Broadcast Products  Innovative NOAA Emergency Radio products Unveiled at CES 2002  PALATINE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002-- ShareCom, a leading marketing and sales organization which specializes in NOAA Weather Radio Products, today announced the formation of a strategic alliance with Maxwood Techics BHD and NIKKO CO., LTD.--to design, develop, manunology LTD., an affiliate and partner of NIKKO Electronfacture, market and sell specialized unique Emergency Weather Radio Products never before seen by the consumer electronics industry!  The partnership has developed three specialized products that ShareCom has introduced, including the latest Homeland Security device introduced at the 2002 Consumer Electronics Show.  In addition to the valued priced WRP-50 Weather Radio, ShareCom has introduced two very special and unique products:  The WRP-500 is a New Graphical Interface Emergency Radio that features a PDA style readout that will allow the end user to track weather related broadcasts on a map of the county that the emergency notification from NOAA is broadcast in. This model will also feature a 20 memory tracking capability that will store the last 20 alerts including the time of date, date and nature of the alerts so the end user can track a storm/emergency as it develops. This unit also features a 20 hour battery back up the will allow the end user complete warning capability in the case that power is lost to the home. With the county codes built into the software, this model is the easiest NOAA Weather Radio on the market to program.  The WRP-900 is a unique computer based homeland security product that will interface with any PC or server network, and will allow people in offices, business and homes to have the most up-to-date weather or national emergency information directly from the federal government. NOAA will be able to broadcast FEMA warnings as well as supply information for ""follow on'' details as to where to go to get food, water, medical help or shelter in the area of a national emergency to weather related disaster.  ""Our ability to develop and produce unique and strategic products is significantly enhanced as a result of this partnership,"" says Brad Nordling, President and CEO of ShareCom, Inc. ""Maxwood Technology has a tremendous amount of technical abilities that we will rely upon in producing the highest quality products possible.""  ""We are pleased to be able to work with ShareCom as a strategic partner in developing and manufacturing communications products that will help inform and protect citizens in the United States of America,"" Kunihiko Ichioka, President and CEO of Maxwood Technology Ltd.     Stay tuned for more announcements to come  More Reasons to Consider Buying SHCC  1. WeatherRadios.com has been awarded a National Partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to increase the use of Weather Radios countrywide through a program called Project Impact. There are 2,600 Project Impact communities in the U.S. The FEMA website lists WeatherRadios.com as a national partner  providing a banner and link to the WeatherRadios.com site. The FEMA site receives over 100,000 visitors per day.  2.  The National Oceanic and Aerospace Administration (NOAA) has WeatherRadios.com listed first on their web site page that tells people where to purchase a NOAA Weather Radio.  3.  The National Weather Service (NWS) has offered to promote corporate sponsorships to the WeatherRadios.com site through  recognition and media support.  4.  Local American Red Cross chapters will promote NOAA Weather Radios through WeatherRadios.com in exchange for a $5.00 donation per sold radio.  5.  The Chicago area AAA will feature SHCC's  2WayTalk.com on its website offering exclusive discounts on Weather Radios, and FRS Family Radios. 2WayTalk.com will also be  listed in the AAA magazine called ""Home and Away"".  6.  The Federation of Manufactured Home Owners of Florida (FMO) has entered into a one-year agreement that will increase the sale of Weather Radios from the WeatherRadios.com site. Mailings and web site links will offer a group discount to members and also pay a rebate to the organization for every radio sold.  7.  The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) has begun to promote the discount that is offered  through WeatherRadios.com site. Magazine articles, mailings and web site links will offer a group discount to members and also pay a rebate to the organization for every radio sold. This      agreement will run for one year.  Why Weather Radios are Poised for Growth  NOAA Weather Radios automatically alert people of impending severe weather conditions ""24/7"". This is especially critical for families while sleeping. These devices are fast becoming recognized as essential and potentially life saving for use in homes, businesses, and critical care facilities.  The National Weather Service (NWS) has stated that there has been an increase in severe weather in the last 10 years and this trend is expected to continue. NWS has a published goal for NOAA Weather Radios to be in every home within the next 10 years. Currently, approximately just 7% of homes have this device. This being said, we can expect a tremendous increase in the presence and sale of weather radios over the coming years. The NWS, NOAA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other government agencies have an aggressive education and funding effort to reach the 100% goal.  New technology called Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) was introduced in the mid 90s. It allows users to set an alarm only for their specific geographic area. This feature is expected to make this tool commonplace in homes alerting families of weather conditions that pose an immediate danger.   Additionally, 2WayTalk.com will continue to focus on Internet users who are outdoor enthusiasts. The market continues to be strong and growing. FRS Family Radios are now becoming a popular family item on vacations, ski trips, camping, and biking events. They are used for a wide variety of purposes, from staying in touch with children playing in the neighborhood, to coordinating soccer tournaments and antique auctions.   A Final Word About SHCC  SHCC is currently booking $45,000/ month and is conservatively projecting earnings next year of $1.3 million on revenues of $13 million. Unlike most e-commerce ventures, ShareCom's marketing ""burn rate"" is very modest. The Company forecasts revenues of $32.5 million the following year, increasing profitability to earn $4.6 million. Given its impressive relationships and the rapidly growing market for its product, SHCC's share price of just 1.6 cents makes it a compelling play for the astute investor.

"","Last night's kick-off for the Children's Book Drive was a huge success.  We had a fantastic turn-out, raised $970 and collected three boxes full of books.  Many people wrote personal inscriptions in the books to the children reminding them that they were in our thoughts and prayers.  Enron Corp has offered to match our contributions 2 to 1, making the total contribution from the pool $2,910.  

The drive is not over yet!  We will accept books and cash until September 28th.  You can come by and visit us on the 35th floor to make a donation.  

We are looking forward to seeing everyone in October for our Halloween Social!  This event is going to be hosted by EGM.  Stay tuned for more details.

Thanks again for a fantastic evening.

"Re:","
Eric,

I just want you to know what I feel now, whether or not it matters.  Never
before have I felt more regret for anything I've done as I have about
breaking up with you, and then engaging in a relationship that has made you
not think highly of me anymore.  I believe that the questions that you ask
me and the reaction that you have are all justified and fair and
reasonable.  I wish I could take it all back or forget about it, but of
course that won't happen.  I have no excuses.  If I were you, I wouldn't
like me either.

One of the things that I really like about you is how well you know
yourself and how consistently your actions are in-line with your beliefs.
I have always had a problem with who I think I should be.  This is one of
the problems I mentioned as needing to be resolved.  I don't know how to
resolve this problem or whether or not it will ever be resolved, but am
aware that I have this problem.  I guess periodically throughout my life so
far, when I think things aren't working, I will try to be a different
person.  I don't know.  I can't really explain it because I don't
understand it.  I always try to be a good person, but as you said, how I
act is a reflection of who I am.  In that light, what I've done to you,
undermining your trust in me, shows that I'm not a very good person.  This
is what I regret most about this whole situation, the fact that I have lost
your trust.

Unfortunately, as I realize in hindsight, there are so many things about
you that I love, that I value so highly, that so many times over outweigh
the things about you that I would complain about before.  Your trust,
patience, kindness, realism, strong sense of self, intelligence,
objectiveness, values, appreciation of me, care for things that were yours,
the care with which you would eat are all things that I miss so much and
hate myself for causing the loss of.

Anyway, thanks for being a forgiving enough person to still talk to me.

Jennifer

Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the decision is getting mixed reviews on Capitol Hill.

The Washington bureau will bring us updates tomorrow.   Also Thursday, we'll have complete coverage of the FERC meeting from the Washington bureau.  Plus, the National Energy Marketers Association recently looked at critical infrastructure protection programs and how energy companies can better secure their facilities.  NEMA President Craig Goodman will join us Thursday from the Washington bureau during the noon ET newscast.   Also from Houston, Britain-based Centrica's President of Texas Operations Don Whaley is penciled in to discuss their participation in the Texas deregulated power market.  Join us during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast for the Whaley interview.   Oil and Gas Journal Director of Internet Operations Les Finalle talks on Thursday about lease bidding on the Internet.  He'll discuss some of the sellers, which include Giant Petroleum, Inc., Lewis Oil Corp., Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas, LLC, and more.      ENL's Kym McNicholas will be live on Thursday from the Invensys Conference in Las Vegas.  Kym is expecting to speak with former Secretary of State James Baker tomorrow.  She'll also talk with British Airways Chairman Lord Marshall about supply and demand issues following the September 11 attacks.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  We'll have the fallout from Thursday's Enron hearings from the Washington bureau on Friday and see what impact if any the investigation could have on energy legislation.  Jerry Taylor from the CATO Institute and Jolen Operating President Dave Fleischaker will join us tomorrow to discuss Enron's effect on legislation.  The bureau will also tell us about the next set of Enron hearings scheduled for next week - one of which is devoted exclusively to the impact of the company's collapse on the nation's energy markets.   We'll also have more from our one-on-one interview with Interior Secretary Gale Norton on Friday.  She'll tell us about the administration's new effort to expand renewable energy production on federal land.   Debate over the ownership of the international waters of the Caspian Sea has gone on for years.  Now with the Caspian Pipeline up and running, there is an increased awareness of the debate.  Vinson & Elkins Partner Bill Weiland talks about the Caspian region with the Houston bureau.  Join us on Friday for our conversation with Weiland.   We have more earnings reports from the Houston bureau on Friday - Enbridge Energy Partners President Dan Tutcher will join us to discuss his company's fourth quarter.   Goldman Sachs Analyst David Maccarrone will join us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.

A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge will hear arguments Friday on whether federal bankruptcy law permits the wholesale preemption of state law and regulation necessary for PG&E's reorganization plan to be confirmed.  PG?and the California Public Utilities Commission are also expected to discuss with the judge whether a separate mediator is needed to attempt to resolve conflicts regarding the plan.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Subject:	Change of Ercot Delivery Points

I am in the process of restructuring the Ercot Region in Enpower to align with the current Ercot zones (as well as the zones that will come into play in 2002).  I have made a few initial changes today that will impact the delivery points you choose as you book deals in the North and South....

Old Delivery Point		New Delivery Point
North 2001			Ercot North
South 2001			Ercot South

I will be making additional changes later this week and will let you know what impact it has on you.  Let me know if you have any questions...

Thanks!

"RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel","RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello Everyone,

The Oracle DBA team would like request NetCo production database downtime starting tomorrow Thursday 01/31/2002 at

Attached is the summary of the reorg work and the estimated downtime.  All NetCo production databases will be ready
no later than Friday 02/01/2002 at 7am if not earlier.

 
Please response with your approval by COB today.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me or your dbas.

Thanks,

"Monday Required Teco Trading","

For Monday,   it is necessary that we sell the following for Frontera:

he 4 -30mw's
he 5 - 30 mw's
he 7 - 30 mw's
he 23 - 85 mw's 
he 24 - 85 mw's


Also,   we need  to buy 15 mw's for hour ending 7 to assist with Frontera's ramp.

We are not running the plant this weekend.    The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline.
We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of.
Also,  please make sure that the OOM premiums (up & down) are input as $50 and $40 respectively.

FYI - for OOM up,  we receive a 14.1 heat rate multiplied by the Houston Ship Channel price.   For this weekend assume $2.05.   IF you can make hourly,  bal-day sales in excess of this,  check with Jerry or Ken at Frontera.

Steve Olinde is notifying Ercot that we are coming down this weekend  for economics.   We have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system.


I will be out of town this weekend.   I can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue.

Thanks,
JMF

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000

"FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., Exec. V.P., FINANCE & TREASURER","
To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  The first Congressional hearing into Enron's collapse takes place Wednesday.  Slated witnesses include the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CEO of Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor.  Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay declined an invitation to participate in the hearings.    The Enron hearing isn't the only energy story on the Hill.  All four FERC Commissioners will participate in a hearing on Representative Joe Barton's (R-TX) new electricity restructuring bill. Barton plans on holding at least two hearings this week on his legislation in hopes of trying to move the bill out of committee before the end of the year.   Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Wednesday House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) is expected to announce his intention to retire from Congress, from the House floor.  We'll keep you updated on the situation from Washington tomorrow.   The Global Oil Trends 2002 study says volatile oil price cycles and increasing competition mean applications of technology are key in determining success for the oil industry.  On Wednesday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will cover an event at which President and CEO of CERA Joseph Stanislaw and Energy Sun Microsystems Manager Larry Rice will talk about the findings from the joint study.     West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas will bring us a report on the state of deregulation in California.  Kym says politicians, state regulators and consumers are becoming more convinced deregulation doesn't work in light of the California energy crisis and Enron's fall.  Catch Kym's report on Wednesday.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Dec. 11, 2001    Crude: $18.08/bbl -$0.29   Unleaded: $0.5061/gallon -$0.048   Heating Oil: $0.4999/gallon -$0.067   Gas: $2.803/mmBtu +$0.056   We'll check in with Alaron Trading Vice President Phil Flynn on Wednesday from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Flynn will bring us an overview of the API and DOE numbers during the noon ET newscast tomorrow.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  The leaders of three of the largest energy industry trade groups will talk Friday about last week's terrorist attacks and their impact on energy.  The Washington bureau will bring us the very latest from the American Petroleum Institute, the American Gas Association and the Edison Electric Institute.     We'll also have more from Thursday's House hearing on electricity issues.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there were some strong comments from members of the FERC regarding the commission's legal authority and the issue of Regional Transmission Organizations.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to have the very latest on any U.S. military response to last week's attacks.   Stewart & Stevenson Vice President of Marketing and Board of Directors Jim Stewart III is penciled in Friday from the Houston bureau.  Stewart & Stevenson is a major supplier of products to the U.S. Army and commercial airlines and tomorrow Stewart will discuss how company operations will change following the terrorist attacks.  He'll join us during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   Also from the Houston bureau, we'll have a report on Dallas-based Ness Energy.  Ness has increased its drilling operations in Israel and the company believes the area is the next Saudi Arabia for oil and gas E?.

Hi TJ and Lisa,  
     Happy 2002!!  I hope this email finds you well.  
     This brief note is to inform you that I will be returning to Harvard - where I received my doctorate in Applied Mathematics.
     I have accepted a job offer from the Harvard Management Company - which manages Harvard's endowment of $20 billion (and still counting).
     If you are ever in the Boston area, please do look me up.  
     Also, will you please forward this email onto the power group so that some of my other friends will know how to get in touch with me in the future.
Best regards to you and yours in 2002,
Iris Marie Mack, MBA/PhD
 
P.S.:  During my first couple of months in Boston I will be staying in corporate housing.  Therefore the best way to reach me is via email:  irismmack@hotmail.com .  Thanks!!!

"FW: Move Related Issues","

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The Senate will have the first official vote this year on comprehensive energy legislation on Monday.  Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott has offered the House energy bill as an amendment to railroad legislation.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the Democratic leadership in the Senate opposes the bill and expects to prevail in voting it down.  The big issue dividing the two parties is whether to open a portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.  The vote is expected to take place at 5:00 ET on Monday and the Washington bureau will bring us the vote outcome as soon as it becomes available.   Peter says the bureau will continue to follow the Enron story as it relates to Washington.  Congressional hearings are now being planned to determine what went wrong and whether there could be a larger impact on the energy sector.  Several federal agencies and the White House continue to monitor the situation, and we'll bring you the latest from Washington next week.   On Monday from the Houston bureau, we'll follow the trail of liquid natural gas and arctic gas.  Catch a report next week on how both are brought to market.   The Houston bureau will continue to bring us the very latest on Enron next week as the energy giant nears bankruptcy.     West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas is set to speak with Energy Research & Consulting's Catherine Horiuchi on Monday. She'll talk about the energy supply in California and whether it will be adequate for the future.     Also on Monday, Kym will bring us a report on Calpine's geothermal strategy in Northern California.  We'll bring you a look at the world's largest producing geothermal resource.   Finally, Kym will be live at Platts' Day of the Trader Conference in  Las Vegas, Nevada.  Be sure to join us for reports from the West Coast bureau all next week.   We'll have a special guest in studio on Monday.  Alaska Department of Natural Resources Director Mark Myers will join us during the  10:00 a.m. ET newscast to discuss the state's 12.5% interest in the Arctic Pipeline Project.      Closing Prices for Friday, Nov. 30, 2001    Crude: $19.44 +$0.82   Unleaded: $0.5343 +$0.0143   Heating Oil: $0.5323 +$0.0129   Natural Gas: $2.701 +$0.140   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a great weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Travel Security Update","
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

"Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan","


A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

On Monday, we'll have an update on the talks between Enron and Dynegy.  As of Friday evening, there was still no word of a deal for Dynegy to buy out its cross-town rival.  Enron's troubles continued on Friday with Moody's downgrading the company's debt ratings to one level above junk bond status.  We'll follow developments next week.   We're full to the brim with guests scheduled from the Houston bureau next week.  We'll kick it off Monday during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast with zed.i solutions CEO Keith Smith.  Smart-Alek is a new product created by zed.i that allows producers to monitor flow rate from gas wells from remote locations.  Smith will bring us details on the product.   On Tuesday from Houston, UBS Paine Webber First Vice  President-Investments Robert Young gives us a comparison and contrast of Kinder Morgan and Enron.  He recommends Kinder as a strong buy right now as opposed to Enron, whose troubles continue to mount.    Also next week, Conoco Project Manager Ken Smith will discuss a  five-year, $50M joint venture.  Conoco, Global Marine, Texaco, Hydril, BP, Chevron, Diamond Offshore and Schlumberger are working on subsea mud lift drilling technology, which has been successfully tested and is now in the marketing stage.  Catch the interview from the Houston bureau during the noon ET newscast on Tuesday.   The showdown in Washington over energy legislation may happen next week as the economic stimulus package reaches the Senate floor.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook reports, there's a possibility that energy legislation could be added as an amendment.     New energy statistics will also be released next week.  The Energy Information Administration will announce energy projections for the U.S. for the next 20 years.  We'll have the forecast for you from the Washington bureau on Wednesday.    We'll have more on Enron from the West Coast bureau next week. On Monday, Henwood Energy Services Managing Director Gary Hunt talks about how a Dynegy/Enron company could have a major impact on one large oil producer in California.   The California Senate's Committee investigating price manipulation in the state's wholesale electricity market will hold a hearing on November 13.  The hearing will focus on allegations by generators that the California ISO has given preferential treatment to the CDWR.  Cal ISO President and CEO Terry Winter received a subpoena requiring him to attend the hearing.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us all the details from the West Coast bureau on Tuesday.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.    Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power

"Frontera ACE Issue for tomorrow","

We have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours 7-11 for $20.   They sold a 340 mw schedule for the onpeak tomorrow.
They will be ramping up starting hour ending 7 for the following:

He7,8  - 30mw's
He 9  - 100
HE 10 - 200
HE 11 -280

So,  basically,  they will be dragging significantly for these hours.    We sold this imbalance to them for $20 and we will take the floating price.
The Resource Plan will only show 340 mw's onpeak.     

Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue.    Just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above.


Thanks,

JMF

"Access Card Information","Subject: Access Card Information

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"Frontera Position for tomorrow","

Sell hour ending 6 only- 30 mw's for Frontera tomorrow.   DO NOT GO TO THE POOL .
If you cannot sell the mw's for a reasonable price ($0 or greater) and the pool appears to be going to a negative,   call Jerry and wake him up.   Have him ramp up starting he 7.
Try to sell tonite if possible,  so we wont have to wake them up.

I have sold the swap to Frontera for tomorrow.

They will be short the following hours:

he 7 - 370
he 8 - 265
he 9 - 200
he 10 - 50

I have sold the swap to them at $24.50.   I sell fixed and buy floating.       If you think that the pool will be high,  then you buy fixed and take to the pool.
You will buy fixed and sell floating.    Net,  we are left with two fixed prices.  Very cool.

Ercot will be calling due to the ACE issue.   The plant will be coming up slowly.

Call if you have questions,

JMF

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

12:52 PM ET Jan 14, 2002	   Latest Market Overview <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/marketsummary/default.asp?siteid=mktw&dist=>	   <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/1.gif>	
Former Enron execs launch energy company 

PHILADELPHIA (CBS.MW) - A group of former Enron executives, who left the now-bankrupt energy merchant in July, announced Monday that they've launched a new company to deliver energy risk management services.

Celeren will cater to small and medium-sized businesses and institutions, which the company said are often overlooked by the larger energy firms.

The Philadelphia-based company will offer risk management through the sale of energy outsource products and independent power generation services. Celeren also will offer long-term, fixed-energy related costs in contrast to the saving guarantees traditionally offered in the market.

""We took the concept of outsourcing for the Fortune 100 companies and privatized it and made it something available to smaller businesses,"" said Celeren President Thomas Brigger in an interview. 

For its customers, Celeren factors in the total cost of energy to the business: the gas or electricity; improvements to infrastructure; the operation and maintenance of the systems; and the financing.

""We charge the customer a flat rate, and the risk that's involved becomes our problem at that point,"" he said. Celeren manages its risk through trading operations.

Celeren is looking for an equity partner to help expand the business in short order. The company expects to close its first deal by the end of next week.

Brigger, who was a regional manager at Enron Energy Services, is president and chief executive. Donald Parker, formerly regional director, asset risk management at Enron Energy Services, is chief operating officer. Mark Wood, James Creighton, and Ram Nathan make up the rest of the executive team. All three worked at Enron ( ENE <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/detail.asp?view=detail&symb=ENE>) in Enron Energy Services.

""Enron treated us very well, but they were making changes...that we didn't quite agree with,"" Brigger said. ""We presented this idea to Enron, but they wanted to focus the business on larger companies. So, we moved on.""

Celeren had hopes of having Enron as a trading partner, he said.

""The unfortunate part of Enron is that a lot of good things went down the drain with the bad,"" Brigger said. Among the bad was arrogance at the highest level of management, the difficulty in understanding the company's accounting practices - now under fire from federal agencies - and a lack of clear leadership, he said.

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"FW: FERC Meeting on November 7","

Subject:	FW: FERC Meeting on November 7

TJ and Claude-please send to your groups. thanks.

 

FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.  The generic docket ""Electricity Market Design and Structure,"" which is the docket FERC is using for its ""RTO Week"" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.  However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

"RE: Regional Research Projects","Boys,

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

"Reminder - Bossa Social Event CHANGE","- Just a Reminder - 


""Help restore a child's hope and imagination through reading. . . . Donate a book to a child affected by America's tragedy.""

Yesterday morning, you were invited to a social gathering on Wednesday, September 19, at Bossa.  In light of this week's tragedy, we would like to use our time together to help support those individuals whose lives have been torn apart.  Most importantly, the children of families affected by this tragedy.  

First Lady Laura Bush stated in a letter written to the nation's schoolchildren on Thursday, ""Our nation is strong, and our people resilient.  We have a well-earned reputation for pulling together in the worst of times to help each other.""  

All of us gain comfort from different things.  Think about what gave you comfort as a child - a special toy, a teddy bear, a favorite book.  When you come to our Quarterly Event next week, we ask that you bring a children's book to donate to a child to help comfort him or her. Please take the time to inscribe a personal note inside of your book, showing a child that you care.  By doing so, each child will know that your thoughts and prayers are with him or her during this difficult time.  

We have changed the focus of our event to support those affected by this tragedy and will kick off a week long children's book drive.  Please join us at Bossa on Wednesday from 5:30 PM - 9:00 PM and take the opportunity to touch the life of someone directly affected by this tragedy.   

If you would like to make a cash donation to help with Enron's relief effort, matching gift forms will be available at the gathering , and Enron will match your contribution 2 to 1.

We look forward to seeing you.

Sincerely, 

Traci Warner
Director
A/A Recruiting

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Let the Enron hearings begin - both the Senate and House begin hearings on the fallen energy giant Thursday.  The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing will focus on whether federal agencies should have foreseen the company's demise.  A second Enron hearing on Thursday in the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations subcommittee will look into the destruction of Enron-related documents by Andersen.  The Washington bureau will have live reports and highlights from the hearings on Capitol Hill throughout the day.   Also from Washington on Thursday, another Senate subcommittee will look at whether it's time to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards.  Senate Democrats are expected to add CAFE increases in their comprehensive energy bill and this hearing is the next step in the process.     Vinson & Elkins attorney Bill Weiland talks with the Houston bureau about bringing oil and gas from Russia to the United States through the Caspian region. Weiland says there are rules over which countries' ships are allowed into ports in the Caspian Sea.  On Thursday, Weiland will talk about the complications and added expenses these rules place on U.S. imports from the Caspian region.       Also from Houston, we'll have a report on a class-action lawsuit filed against Andersen.  The plaintiffs are accusing the auditing firm of racketeering.  This is the first lawsuit against Andersen charging the firm with violations under the RICO act.   From the West Coast on Thursday, Portland General Electric Spokesperson Scott Simms joins us to discuss electricity restructuring in Oregon.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Simms about some new options for electricity customers starting March 1, 2002.  Simms joins us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast.   We'll have earnings updates from New York on Thursday - Merrill Lynch Analyst Daniel Rolling will join us during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast to discuss Arch Coal and Consol Energy earnings.  We'll also be joined by UBS Warburg's Matthew Warburton Thursday.  He's going to bring us Conoco earnings and fourth-quarter expectations for the oil sector.  Don't miss Warburton during the noon ET newscast.     Closing Prices for Wednesday, Jan. 23, 2002    Crude: $19.50/bbl +$0.52   Unleaded: $0.5635/gallon +$0.156   Heating Oil: $0.5253/gallon +$0.112   Gas: $2.076/mmBtu -$0.030   Fwd uE(Feb.): $3.43/mmBtu -$0.16   Video Library: ENL's interview with Secretary of Interior Gale Norton is now logged in the Video Library.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  In the wake of Enron's downfall, the Senate Energy Committee is taking a second look at the Public Utility Holding Company Act.  On Wednesday, the Committee will hold a hearing on the PUHCA and our Washington bureau will bring us the latest.   With talk of possible criminal activities in Enron's trading division, many are wondering what liabilities UBS Warburg could face.  On Wednesday from the Houston bureau, we'll talk with former U.S. Attorney and Porter and Hedges Partner Dan Hedges about problems that could arise for UBS Warburg.   Haynes and Boone, LLP Attorney Larry Pascal talks about how Argentina's economic crisis is affecting the energy industry. We'll have details on the disarray in Argentina from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.    On the West Coast, ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Saber Partners CEO Joseph Fichera on Wednesday.  Fichera says there are some serious issues being overlooked in regard to the CPUC's rate agreement with the CDWR.  Fichera will share his concerns during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Also on Wednesday, Kym says she'll have more on the California Senate Energy Committee's hearing on the Independent Systems Operators' Market Design Plan for 2002.  Members of the committee say they have serious doubts about the ISO's ability to enforce market rules going forward.   We'll also talk with Hydrogenics President and CEO Pierre Rivard on Wednesday.  Rivard will join us from the NASDAQ during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast to discuss hydrogen fuel cell technology.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2002    Crude: $20.07/bbl unchanged   Unleaded: $0.5852/gallon -$0.0079   Heating Oil: $0.5369/gallon -$0.0012   Gas: $2.074/mmBtu -$0.043   Fwd uE(Mar.): $3.55/mmBtu -$0.02   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

"FROM CINDY OLSON, COMMUNITY RELATIONS: Body Shop Reopening","Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The White House continues to push for an economic stimulus package, with time running out for Democrats and Republicans trying to reach a deal.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Tuesday, we'll continue to watch for developments with the stimulus legislation. Some of the proposals contain significant tax relief potential for energy businesses.   The Senate Commerce Committee's Consumer Affairs Subcommittee will hold its first hearing Tuesday on the collapse of Enron. Peter says like the previous hearing on the House side, Enron management is not expected to take part.  At least one Enron shareholder will participate.   When Enron wraps up its bankruptcy case, many may walk away with little or no money.  However, some will benefit from Enron's demise - bankruptcy attorneys.  On Tuesday, University of Houston Law Center Director, Dean Nancy Rapaport talks about how corporate bankruptcies equal big business for lawyers.   Continuing Enron coverage, Raymond James & Associates Oil Field Service Analyst Jim Rollyson is stopping by the Houston bureau on Thursday.  He'll talk about the effects of the Enron collapse on the oil field services industry during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   UBS PaineWebber First Vice President of Investments Robert Young will also join us from the Houston bureau on Tuesday.  He'll bring us up to speed on how the investment community views companies cutting expenses.  Catch Young during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas will talk with California ISO President Terry Winter on Tuesday about transmission constraints in the San Francisco Bay Area and the outlook for this winter and next summer.      Closing Prices for Monday, Dec. 17, 2001    Crude: $19.15/bbl -$0.07   Unleaded: $0.5407/gallon -$0.0048   Heating Oil: $0.5337/gallon -$0.0044   Gas: $2.686/mmBtu -$0.16   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

Ryan-

This product is now in the active status.  Unfortunately, the 7x8 loadshape is out of our hands until the EnPower guys can come up with a solution.  I'll keep our testing/bridging team on it..  Also,  send an email to Stephanie Sever and Karen O'day requesting Execute access for Product Manager (all products you currently have read access for) and Read access for all Nat. Gas.  Be sure to copy your desk head on the email.  Call me with any questions.

Chris-

Can you please approve the following product for Eric Saibi (EOL Product # 66296).  Any news on the 7X8 product?  Eric wants to roll it out as quickly as possible.    
Additionally, when log into Product Manager.....I am unable to create any products as my access is ""read only.""  What do I need to do to have this changed and have read only access to gas products added?  

Thanks,

Ryan

"positions for tomorrow","A reminder,   I am 55 mws long for hours 23 & 24 today.   This has been scheduled into the North Zone.    If you sell make sure that you cut the Enpower deal and make the appropriate entries in the Portal.   Enpwr deal   834600   is the sale to North Zone.


The Ercot Asset desk is long 5 mw's  for the offpeak hours at $9.20.   The  Enpwr deal number is #836534
If you sell hours 1-6,  cut this sale to Ercot Imbal and replace with the appropriate counterparty under Hourly Ercot book.    We will leave


Additionally,   Frontera needs to sell the following:

hour ending 4 - 30 mw's
he 5 - 30 mws
he 6 - 85 mw's
Put these purchases/ sales in the Teco Services book.

I have sold them the power swap where I sell them 100 mw for 7&8 ($25).    I then pay the pool price.    If prices somehow appear that they will be greater than $25 for these hours,  please cover and schedule to the South Zone



The Swap went very well today,  since we had a physical position:

Although the physical may lose $1500,  the financial swap will make $17,000.

Here's how it works:
When you buy balday,   you buy fixed ($30) and sell floating (Ercot Pool)
Today I sold fixed ( $37) and bought floating.     

The floating components cancel and we are left with a $7 margin.


Call if you have questions.

"VERY IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR TOMORROW!!!","


Item One
The Frontera Plant is scheduled to sell 450 mw's for tomorrow.   I sold them a financial swap @ $24 for the whole day.   For the first part of the day we will be running extremely short.   We will just  that we are having problems coming up.
This is the amount that will be short:

he7 - 420 mw's
he 8 - 420 mw's
he 9 - 420 mw's
he 10 - 315 mw's
he 11 - 230 mw's 
he 12 - 22    100 mw's


I would like you to buy power for 7-11 for alot less than $24.    If you cant,  then we will take the imbalance price.   If you do buy,  purchase under the Ercot Asset book and schedule to South Zone load for the Ercot Asset book.   If you have questions,  call me.



Item Two

I purchased 99 mw's from City of Austin for tomorrow,  hours ending 7-22 under the Ercot Asset book.  I sold this power to the ST ERCOT desk for $28.75.
This power can be rescinded intraday.    WE NEED TO CALL CITY OF AUSTIN TOMORROW WELL BEFORE FLOW AND TELL THEM WE ARE NOT TAKING THESE MW'S.   THEY SUPPOSEDLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS DEAL.   THEY ARE NOT TO GENERATE.     CUT DEAL # 849947 IN ENPOWER SCHEDULING AND REPLACE WITH PURCHASES UNDER ERCOT ASSET.
We will either purchase 100 mw's balday (well below $28.75) or take the pool price.
For the hours that are filled by the pool,  I need a purchase from Ercot Imbalance (under Ercot Asset book),  zero price and mk-mkt flag set to ""no.""


Obviously,   the market will be short tomorro, especially in the morning.   Purchase at least some megawatts for tomorrow,   but dont give away our position.
Maybe we could import from the East.  That would be great.    If you left us short for  100 mw's 12-22,  that would be cool.   We can take care of that.

FRONTERA NEEDS TO BUY 50 mw for hour ending 2300 to cover Mirant sale for the last hour.     Purchase under the Teco Service book and sell to Frontera under Teco Services book.   In Portal,  we would enter a purchase from X  and we should balance against an existing Mirant sale for hour ending 2300.   Cut the Frontera 50mw in the Portal so we will balance.

Call if you have questions,

JForney

"Position for tomorrow","

We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.    We want to remain that way,  unless the balancing energy market goes haywire.
We would need to delete our SC counterparty EL Paso and input a replacement QSE in the portal if this is filled.
Enpower shows 100 mw's coming from Ercot imbalance.

This deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day,  etc.

UBI was founded by a group of Enron analysts in 1996, and has since grown to
include volunteers from more than 15 corporations in Houston.

UBI volunteers work on consulting teams with small business owners and
entrepreneurs in Houston's inner city on projects such as developing
business and marketing plans, conducting financial analyses, and providing
technology assessments.  They also develop and conduct business education
seminars to promote business literacy in Houston.

Please join us if you would like to learn more about the Urban Business
Initiative and the impact we are having on Houston's inner-city businesses.

?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give testimony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week.  What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energy market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.    

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Schmuel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Carol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works.  

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not physical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissioner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could work together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it's okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premise, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or flowgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not agreed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstances change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on which instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs being allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front.  

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

"Re: Hello :-)","Eric, 
Nice to hear back from you, and nice talking to you earlier.   
It seems like days ago that Adnan and I were hanging out in Saint Louis with  
nothing to do but drinking, smoking, and gambling.  (I did most of the smoking, and Khan the gambling).  But this December it will have been three years since we finished our college careers.  Where does the time go?
That's very interesting, Adnan never mentioned the gambling.  But it doesnt surprise me after seeing him in our last trip to Vegas. 
Sure I wouldn't mind hanging out with your friend if she is similarly 
inclined.  It can be a bit awkward at times being around so many people who 
you do not know, and I am by nature a quiet person.  I'm not looking for 
anything more than just good company.  As you may know I just broke up with 
my girlfriend of two years, and I'm just getting used to being on my own so 
to speak.
Yes, I totally understand.  Like I said, i'm not trying to play matchmaker, I just wanted both of you to have good company.  I know how you must feel.  In a way, I'm all of my friends' ""councelor.""  I'm the one they usually come to when they have relationship problems and need advice, or plainly vent.  So I know these past few weeks have probably not been easy for you... and all I can really tell you is that time and self realization will heal the pain.  We've all been there.  
Although I have every intention of attending your wedding, I should let you 
know that my father has been ill, and that there may be matters which might 
require my attention in San Francisco.  Hopefully, this will not be the 
case.  And if so I promise to make a trip out to visit both of you in the 
near future. 
Not a problem.  Family is always first.   
Like I was saying earlier... Friday night is when my best guy friend, Mike, was thinking of taking Adnan out with all the other guys.  Alllll the guys know that anything to do with stripping is out of the question.  So Mike suggested going out to a bar or something like that and just drinking, and do the ""guy thing"".  whatever that may be.  I thought maybe you could get in contact with him and see what you guys want to do.  But keep in mind, that the wedding rehearsal is the next morning (sat 12/01/01) at 11:30am.  So I need my fiance to be ""okay"" by that time :-)  
Here's mike's e-mail... 
eyebal7@yahoo.com 
Make sure you tell him you're the best man, and you'll be coming in for the wedding on friday, and see what you guys can plan.  I know it will be hard since you're so far away, but Mike knows the ropes pretty well around here :-)  
So tell me something Adnan has probably not told me :-)  Like when he went out with ""Juggles/Jiggles"" and what he was like back when you guys were in college.  Did he tell you i almost went to Wash U?  I visited the campus w/ my dad back in august of 1996, and I loved it.  I had just returned from Europe that year, and I started to get into the groove of the whole college app thing, so my dad took me to see a bunch of places I might consider going to.  I got into Wash U, but I didn't go obviously... I always wonder... what if??  :-) 
Anyways... it's near my bed time, so I must depart.  I hope we can get to know each other a bit better within the next few weeks, and definitely into the future.

"Fw: Hi!","
 
----- Original Message -----  
From: Clifford S.  Ang  
To: Eric Saibi  
Sent: Monday, January 28, 2002 4:00 AM
Subject: RE: Hi!
That stuff on e-bay was cool.  At least you made  use of some of your Enron stuff.  It's great to hear that you're working  for UBS Warburg.  Which group are you with now?  
 
I think my dad is planning a trip to the Chicago Food  Show sometime in May.  I'm not sure on how that will go, but I may join him  then.  I also need to drop by Saint Louis to renew my driver's  license.  Besides, I haven't been back since graduation.  Adnan told  me that you just bought a place.  It would be great to visit you and Texas  for the first time.  I may stay longer with you guys (I also have a friend  living in Austin) before I finally come back home.  
 
My parents and I are going to China in March, and I was  surprised that they're asking my girlfriend to go along with us.  The Wash  U International Advisory Council Meeting will be held in China in March and I  will just catch them for their last leg.  
 
Business in the Philippines is really bad, and it's not  going anywhere in the near future.  I had this deal with Adnan last  December to January.  He wanted me to sell used hard disks to prospective  buyers in the Philippines.  I found one group and it took a long time to  get the goods here and out of customs.  Finally, during the first week of  January, the goods were released and shit turned worse.  The buyer claimed  that we shipped him 95% defective items.  Out of the 400+ hard drives,  around 200 had bad sectors (which were deemed to be good drives by most people),  21 were good, and the balance were either not detected or had this knocking  sound.  Anyway, I think Adnan was willing to give him some sort of refund  on the balance, but the guy kept on insisting for Adnan not to negotiate the  letter of credit.  The whole thing was so fucked up, and the guy was  implying that he was going to sue me for intentionally scamming him off  US$6,800.  I couldn't believe that he would think that I would destroy my  credibility for such a small amount of money.  Anyway, the problem seems to  be hanging out there, but the buyer had some fishy stuff going.  He called  me to go to his place and, when I arrived, they have finished testing all the  drives.  I mean, they should have waited for me to get there before testing  at least half of the drives for their own protection.  Now, we could not  tell whether the drives that were displayed (and they were displayed in an  extremely organized manner) were actually ours or not.  Second, his  unwillingness to take a refund instead of stopping the LC negotiation is  somewhat irregular.  We were thinking that maybe he doesn't have enough  funds in the bank or something to cover his line.  Third, he wanted to send  back all goods and charge it to us.  That way, if he indeed changed our  good drives with defective ones, he would have gotten 400 good drives and gotten  rid of his bad ones free of charge.  Adnan shipped 200 drives from the same  lot to his dad in Pakistan, and they came out around 12% defective.  Even  at that level, 50% seems to be too far away.  So, there, since we haven't  negotiated the letter of credit yet (it should be done within this week), I  haven't heard from the buyer.  I would not be surprised if I receive some  subpoena or something from the bastard after we negotiate the LC.  Anyway,  I asked my lawyer, and he said that there is really not much of a case on his  side.  Besides, all documents were made by Adnan and him.  He cannot  sue Adnan, so his only choice is to sue me ... if that's what he wants.   Well, let's see how it goes.
 
I got a bunch of financial consultancy work on the  side.  I arrange financing for some people with our bank contacts.   It's very tedious and time consuming to complete a deal.  Sometimes, the  odds of getting a good deal are very slim that I can't really depend on these  things for regular income.  I can't spend that much anymore.  I'm  saving up for my future.  I may actually get married in a year or  two.  I don't know yet, but this relationship is getting pretty serious and  I think that she's the one.  She's studying medicine and will be graduating  this April.  She'll have another year of internship before taking the  boards next year.  She wants to go to the US for her residency, but we'll  see how things go.  Any good medical schools/hospitals there in  Houston?  
 
Well, I gotta go now.  Just write when you have  time.
 
Cliff

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook will sit down for a one-on-one interview with Interior Secretary Gale Norton Wednesday. Peter plans to ask Secretary Norton about the pending fight in Congress over drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the future of energy production on federal lands.  We'll have portions of the interview starting tomorrow afternoon.   Congress returns to work on Wednesday - The early agenda will be filled with Enron hearings, as both the House and Senate begin hearings on Thursday.  We'll have the latest on Wednesday, including the lists of likely witnesses for each hearing.       The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is holding a hearing Wednesday to consider whether to reauthorize legislation that indemnifies the nuclear industry in the event of a major nuclear accident called the Price Anderson Act.  The Washington bureau will have all the highlights from the hearing tomorrow.   Wednesday, the Houston Bureau talks with MoneyLine host Lou Dobbs about the Enron story.  Dobbs says there will be many more shoes to drop in this tragedy.  Catch Dobbs from Houston tomorrow.   On Wednesday, we'll be talking live with Laredo Energy President Glenn Hart.  Hart will join us in the Houston bureau during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast to discuss a newly formed partnership between EnCap Investment, LLC and Michael Petroleum.   We'll have more fourth-quarter earnings releases on Wednesday from Houston, including Dynegy and Halliburton.  Watch for Kerr-McGee earnings from ENL Headquarters as well.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas will have more on a new California Senate Resolution sponsored by Senator Steve Peace.  The resolution praises Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood, and at the same time, shows displeasure with previous FERC boards.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Jan. 22, 2002    Crude: $18.34/bbl +$0.34   Unleaded: $0.5479/gallon +$0.0087   Heating Oil: $0.5141/gallon $0.000   Gas: $2.106/mmBtu -$0.130   Fwd uE(Feb.): $3.55/mmBtu -$0.04   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The Washington bureau will have a full plate when we return from Thanksgiving break.  Congress returns with many lawmakers urging action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a long list of legislation ahead of energy in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but Republicans are threatening to force a vote through a filibuster.  In turn, Democrats are saying they'll filibuster any energy bill containing a provision to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  The legislation battle continues next week.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the FERC's major decisions regarding how it assesses market power.  The Commission announced a major change this week that will impact many of the large and small utilities across the country.   Also next week, we'll see what Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King has to say about Pat Wood's performance as Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham - on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's hearing in Washington.   ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week on a Louisiana company that uses rice hulls to create power.  Agrilectric Incorporated consumes some of this power, but most of the electricity is sold to an area utility company.  We'll have details next week.   Also, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage from the Alaska Resources Conference taking place next Thursday and Friday.  We'll also bring you details on the final report regarding the chosen route of the Arctic natural gas pipeline.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.   We'll hear from Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Executive Director John White next week.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with White about his organization's opposition to the state's long-term power contracts.  Catch White from the West Coast bureau next week.   Closing Prices for Nov. 21, 2001:   Crude: $18.96       Unleaded: $0.5273   Heating Oil: $0.5342   Natural Gas: $2.813    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a great Thanksgiving break!  We'll see you on Monday.   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  On Wednesday, we'll continue our live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day.   Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on energy legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the anthrax scare in Washington.  Congressional office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday.   The Washington bureau will also cover Wednesday's FERC meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations.  Peter says new proposals for developing RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the FERC's agenda.   Dyonyx CEO Fred Pratt will talk with the Houston bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. Dyonyx is a privately held information technology and management-consulting firm.  Join us for the Pratt interview from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.   We'll also get a Texas PUC update on Wednesday.  ENL's Gale Smith says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Texas PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Texas.  Be sure to catch all this from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   California Power Authority Chairman S. David Freeman gives a reflective look back at the state's energy crunch from the West Coast bureau Wednesday.  Freeman also talks about how the state plans to stay out of the headlines in the future.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station will go ahead with plans to set off its 49 sirens on Wednesday to make sure warning systems are operational.  Kym says they will continue the test despite their concerns of a jittery public in light of recent terrorist attacks.   Video Library Update: If you happened to miss it, check out ENL's interview with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).  Sen. Bingaman discussed the status of energy legislation in the Senate and the anthrax threat in Washington.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The Enron/Dynegy story continues to heat up, and ENL's Gale Smith says they'll have the very latest on developments surrounding the companies from the Houston bureau on Friday.     William-Paul Thomas of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition talks to ENL's Myra Jolivet in the Houston bureau.  Thomas is previewing the Rainbow/Push energy conference taking place in Houston next week. He'll also have comments on Enron's involvement in the conference.     Also, Signa Engineering Corporation Chairman and CEO Rick Stone is penciled in at the Houston bureau on Friday.  Stone is talking about underbalanced drilling and whether it's still the drilling technology of choice for E?companies.  Join us during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast for the Houston bureau's conversation with Stone.   On Friday from the ENL trading floor, Stephanie Stanton will speak with Platts Natural Gas Markets Editor Liane Kucher.  During the  9:00 a.m. ET newscast Kucher will discuss the natural gas price jump of 79% in November.   We can also look for a progress report from the Washington bureau on Friday on where energy legislation stands in Congress.   Friday, we'll also see where the coal industry is headed.  The National Coal Council met this week in Washington, and tomorrow we'll hear what participants are saying about some of the issues and opportunities facing the industry.     The Washington bureau will bring us more on developments at the FERC regarding Regional Transmission Organizations.  The Commission is giving states more time to get on board the RTO bandwagon and provide more input on the subject.  We'll bring you a closer look at the implications of this week's order from the Washington bureau on Friday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas will also take a look at this week's FERC order and what changes are underway at the California ISO in light of the order.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.    Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Regards,

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Tuesday could be a pivotal day for energy on Capitol Hill.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says a cloture vote on the Senate floor could effectively kill efforts by some Senate Republicans to force a comprehensive energy bill to the floor.  Republicans are trying to attach energy legislation to a defense-spending bill while Democrats opposing the move are using their control of the Senate to fight it.  We'll have the very latest from the Washington bureau on Tuesday.     Peter also says the bureau will be covering a hearing Tuesday in the Senate Energy Committee to discuss the proposed natural gas pipeline that would connect Alaska to the lower 48 states.  The witness list includes Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, FERC Chairman Pat Wood and Williams CEO Keith Bailey.  Among other issues, Senators are expected to question claims from the industry that the pipeline would cost too much to build.  Gas Daily Assistant Editor Nathan Hodge will drop by during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast to give us his take on where the project stands.    On Monday, Rep. Joe Barton (R) Texas and some Texas members of Congress toured the Big Hill strategic petroleum reserve site near Beaumont, Texas.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet reports, Rep. Barton wants to introduce legislation to fill the country's SPR sites.   Rep. Barton says he has support for the legislation as a way to protect the nation's petroleum supply, especially following the recent attacks on America.  We'll bring you updates from Rep. Barton's trip tomorrow.   Also from Houston, Texas PUC Chairman Max Yzaguirre will talk about upcoming deregulation and the move by Shell Energy to pull out of the competitive market even before the competition begins in January.  Don't miss Yzaguirre from the Houston bureau on Tuesday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports, the California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Tuesday.  Kym say the Commission is considering a rate stabilization plan that would call for a rate increase and an end of rate-freeze tariffs.   Also on Tuesday, the California State Board of Equalization begins a three-day workshop discussing the exclusion of certain small electric generation facilities from a state tax assessment.  Log on Tuesday for reports from the West Coast bureau.   Programming Note: Catch interviews from Stephanie Stanton's recent trip to the Women's Power Marketing Symposium throughout the week.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be very busy next week.  Our Washington bureau will be covering the resumption of two high-profile cases at the Commission - the California refund case and the investigation into El Paso's gas transactions in California.  Administrative law judges handling both cases have scheduled new hearings for next week.  We are also scheduled to sit down with FERC Chairman Pat Wood to get his assessment of the year ahead at the Commission.  Look for the Wood interview on Tuesday.     On Monday, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will make his first visit to Yucca Mountain.  Many in the nuclear industry are hoping the Nevada facility will serve as the nation's first repository for highly radioactive waste.  We'll have details of Abraham's visit next week.   We'll also hear from an expert on the impact Euro conversion could have on energy companies doing business in Europe.  Center for Strategic and International Studies Robin Niblett will talk about the conversion during the noon ET newscast on Monday.   Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says a change of venue decision is expected next week in the Enron bankruptcy case.  Judge Arthur Gonzalez will decide whether the case will be moved from New York to Houston.  We'll keep you informed on the situation from the Houston bureau next week.   Also from Houston, we'll discuss a cleaner-burning diesel replacement fuel made from natural sources such as vegetable oils and animal fats - Biodiesel.  On Monday, Industrialinfo.com Synthetic Fuels Manager Jay Brunson joins us to discuss the replacement fuel.   The California State Legislature is back to work on Monday and there are many energy issues expected to pop up in 2002.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says restructuring California's energy markets and the future direction of the new California Power Authority are a few topics the legislature will address.   The California Public Utilities Commission begins a hearing on the potential impact of Enron's demise on Monday.  We'll have details on the hearing from our West Coast bureau next week.   Finally from Sacramento on Monday, California ISO Manager of Market Design Lorenzo Kristov talks with Kym about the grid operators' in-depth market design plan for 2002.   The plan is scheduled for release on Tuesday.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax scare on Capitol Hill on Thursday.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the decision to shut down the House of Representatives until Tuesday means at least one energy hearing on MTBE will be delayed.  The Senate remains in session and we hope to hear from Senators on Thursday about the situation.   Peter also says the bureau will have more reaction to the news that Department of Energy official Joe Kelliher has been picked by  President Bush to fill the vacant seat at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Kelliher's name has been on the top of the list for some time, and now the decision is official.   PSE?Director of Interregional Transmission Laura Manz will also join us from the Washington bureau on Thursday.  Manz has been participating in the FERC RTO workshop, and she'll give us her take on what might come out of the weeklong meetings.  Join us during the  10:00 a.m. ET newscast for the Manz interview.   IBM Chemical and Petroleum Industry Vice President of Marketing Craig Hodges is penciled in from the Houston bureau on Thursday. IBM has been selected by Shell Oil to create the prototype for a wireless gas station named the e-Station.  Catch Hodges during the  noon ET newscast.   West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas reports, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will be in California to announce a new public-private partnership regarding ""Path 15,"" a transmission bottleneck in California.  Abraham will also give a keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's Electricity.     Also from the West Coast bureau on Thursday, Kym talks with a Spokesperson about the Valero refinery's plan to build one power plant to operate the refinery and one to sell energy to off-site customers.  The California Energy Commission is expected to decide Wednesday night whether to grant the Valero refinery, located in Benicia, a permit to build.   From the NASDAQ in New York, NYMEX President Robert Collins will join us.  He'll discuss the status of NYMEX operations and trading following the September 11th attacks during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  Members of Congress return from their Thanksgiving break on Tuesday as debate resumes in Washington.  A bill that would renew the Price Anderson Act is being brought to the floor of the House of Representatives.  The bill limits the liability for the nuclear industry in the event of a major accident.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  The National Academy of Sciences may change its original report on fuel economy standards.  Washington Correspondent Alison Kosik reports, those on the panel say they may have miscalculated the numbers, overestimating the fuel efficiency gains possible for the next generation of vehicles.  We'll have an update on the Academy's announcement on Friday from the Washington bureau.     Major players that could be effected by energy legislation are meeting Friday behind closed doors to discuss emissions issues.  Senator Jim Jeffords, (I)-Vermont, is leading the meeting, which could help craft his multi-pollution legislation.  We'll have reaction to the negotiations on Capitol Hill from the Washington bureau tomorrow.     Jacobs Consultancy Managing Director Karl Bartholomew says multiple requirements being placed on boutique fuels could make them so expensive, many small U.S. refineries may be put out of business.  We'll bring you the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.     Following delays and computer problems during the Texas Pilot Program, ERCOT is switching more Texas customers over to its computer system.  ERCOT COO Sam Jones talks about the switch from the Houston bureau on Friday.    West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas talks with Phoenix Consulting's Susan Schneider on Friday.  Schneider will discuss the DWR rate agreement, California ISO's budget and electricity market regulations.   We'll also have a report from the West Coast bureau on this winter's forecasted natural gas supply, as well as PG? and Southern California Gas Company's efforts to improve California's intrastate pipelines.  Kym also says we may hear more from federal court on the California PUC/Southern California Edison rescue plan.  We'll have all this from the West Coast bureau on Friday.

"Frontera for hour ending 7 tomorrow,   9/21","


For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report    

The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.

Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.


Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.

Call if you have questions.



JMF

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Congress is out of town, but we've still got plenty of energy news from Washington.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets on Tuesday.  One of the issues on the FERC's agenda is a complaint filed against the California Independent System Operator.  Some companies allege the ISO is giving the California Department of Water Resources preferential market treatment in its new role as California's main power purchaser.  We'll bring you the latest from the FERC on Tuesday.    ENL's Washington bureau will also cover the release of the North American Electric Reliability Council's Winter Assessment on Tuesday.  The new NERC report will be released at 9:30 a.m. ET from the National Press Club in Washington.   Also on Tuesday, ENL's Alison Kosik will bring us more from the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Conference in Washington.  The event focuses on the latest in clean coal innovation and the prospects for coal-fired generation in the U.S.   Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports, many companies feel wild price swings could be eliminated with more accurate weather predictions.  On Tuesday, Kim talks with Reliant Energy about steps that can be taken to minimize weather risks.   Ivanhoe Energy Vice President of Investor Relations John MacDonald talks with our Houston bureau about plans his company has for Gas-to-Liquids production.  This type of motor fuel is odorless and emissions-free.  We'll have more from MacDonald on Tuesday.   From the NASDAQ on Tuesday, ESAI Power and Gas Services Director Edward Kraples will join us.  During the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast, he'll talk about the amount of investment needed to keep Northwest power prices from escalating.   Broadcasting Note: Thanksgiving is this Thursday and the ENL staff is preparing the turkey.  The markets are closed Thursday and Friday, so we'll be dark.     Wrap Note: In response to many viewer requests, starting today we're going to add some of the day's commodity settles.  We hope you'll enjoy this new addition to the daily wrap.   Crude:  $17.72  Unleaded: $.5079  Heating Oil: $.5238  Natural Gas: $2.791   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new ""Morning Briefing"" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

Such activity includes change in credit rating, bankruptcy filings, high risk shut-off notices, health and safety concerns, possible litigation, etc. File the relevant information by either phone or e-mail and note it as an URGENT ISSUE to enable the Business Center to act immediately.  

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 ""This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000,"" says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  ""We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities.""

GasMarktFax Stirs ""Trouble"" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  ""Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs,"" said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  ""However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice,"" Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

""This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland,"" declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

""This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland,"" adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible.""

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal

The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: ""We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices.""

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  We'll bring you more Monday on the showdown over energy heating up in the U.S. Senate.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Republicans plan to attach comprehensive energy legislation to the economic stimulus plan expected to hit the floor next week. Democrats plan to fight the effort.   Peter also says people in Washington are expecting a decision from the Bush administration on whether the President intends to add to the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  It currently stands at 543 million barrels and some in Congress are pushing for the White House to fill the SPR to its capacity of 700 million barrels.   Former Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson will join us live from Washington on Monday at noon ET.   Richardson will give us his insight on the current debate over energy in the Senate and other topics.   The Houston bureau will speak with Industrial Information Resources Synfuels & Petroleum Refining Group Manager Chris Paschall on Monday.  He'll have details on new multi-million dollar ethanol plants that are coming online in the U.S. in anticipation of the banning of MTBE.   Also from the Houston bureau on Monday, Duke Energy Group President of Energy Services Harvey Padewer talks about the importance of safety and security at U.S. nuclear plants following the September 11th attacks.  We'll hear from Padewer from the Houston bureau on Monday.   From the West Coast bureau on Monday, we'll have more on the FERC Conference on Energy Infrastructure in the West.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us an update on the issues covered, concerns expressed, and comments from those attending in Seattle.     Kym will also discuss a proposed plan for public power in San Francisco.  On Monday, we'll have comments on the plan from California Power Authority Chair David Freeman.     On Tuesday, California Alliance for Distributed Energy Resources Chairman Jairam Gopal is expected to speak with Kym.  He'll talk about the integration and hybridization of distributed energy generation technologies in the state.  Join us for reports from the West Coast bureau next week.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  President Bush delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, and on Wednesday our Washington bureau will bring us complete coverage of the speech as it relates to energy.  During his address, the President will likely discuss the pending debate in the U.S. Senate over comprehensive energy legislation.  President Bush is not expected to mention Enron by name, but he's expected to touch on some of the issues raised by the company's bankruptcy.   There's a regular Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting on Wednesday.  There are a host of issues on the agenda including the Commission's new push to address market power and the California case.   Finally from Washington, in the wake of the Enron implosion, there's talk of a new lobbying effort on behalf of electricity restructuring.  Former FERC Chairman James Hoecker is spearheading the effort and will talk with us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow about where those efforts stand.   Altira Managing Partner Dirk McDermott talks about challenges new energy companies face when trying to find investors, especially since the Enron crisis.  On Wednesday in the Houston bureau, we'll hear from McDermott and have details on his speech from Energy Venture Fair II, where he addressed the issue.   Also from Houston, AES New Energy President Clem Palevich talks about the challenges his company faces in the new Texas electric deregulated market in Texas.     Bonneville Power Administration Spokesperson Mike Hansen will join West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.   Hansen will discuss how lower market prices will lead to higher rates in the Northwest.      More on energy prices - from New York on Wednesday, Merrill Lynch Senior Economist Gerald Cohen will discuss the impact of energy prices on the economy.  He'll also give us his expectations for the Fed.  Catch Cohen during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.

"Ken Lay Resigns from Board","Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board.""

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay breaks his silence - Lay is expected to testify in front of a Congressional hearing on Monday.  We are planning to provide live coverage of the entire hearing in addition to our regular newscasts.  Our Washington bureau will also be reporting live from the hearing every hour with updates. The hearing is one of 12 scheduled in Congress next week related to the Enron collapse.   In addition to appearances by Lay, former CEO Jeff Skilling and former CFO Andrew Fastow will testify Thursday in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  The Washington bureau will track this hearing, and any others that may have an impact on the energy sector.    Our Houston bureau will also have reaction to former Enron CEO Ken Lay's testimony in Washington.     In the first legal showdown over electricity deregulation in Texas, two state agencies are entangled in a lawsuit over rates set under the state's deregulation program.   The Office of the Public Utility Council is suing the Public Utility Commission over the rates a default provider can charge in the western service territory for TXU Corporation.  We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Monday.     West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas talks with California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch about the proposed Rate Agreement with the California Department of Water Resources.  Lynch says the PUC, DWR and Wall Street made a number of compromises in order for an acceptable deal to materialize.   Director of the California Department of Finance Timothy Gage also talks with Kym about the proposed Rate Agreement between the CPUC and the CDWR.  He'll discuss the bridge loans that will hold the state over until $12.5 billion in consumer-backed energy bonds are issued.  Gage will also discuss the state's budget crisis and how to secure California's energy future on Monday.      E Source Energy Industry Analyst Matthew Joyce comes to us from Boulder on Monday during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Joyce has the latest on what former Enron customers are doing since the fall of the energy giant.     Closing Prices for Friday, Feb. 1, 2002    Crude: $20.38/bbl +$0.90   Unleaded: $0.6034/gallon +$0.0292   Heating Oil: $0.5531/gallon +$0.0215   Gas: $2.138/mmBtu unchanged   Fwd uE(Mar.): $3.61/mmBtu +$0.22   Newscast Update: Starting at 9:30 a.m. ET, we'll have wall-to-wall coverage of former Enron CEO Ken Lay's testimony at a Congressional hearing in Washington.  You can view the hearing as it happens by going to the ENL Video Library.  We hope you'll take some time to watch this special coverage on Monday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  Growing developments in Washington regarding Enron - second hearing has been added for this Thursday.  A complete list of who will testify remains up in the air.  We'll have all the details on hearings in the nation's capital from our Washington bureau on Tuesday.   A key Democrat in the U.S. Senate is taking the offensive Tuesday in the debate over national energy policy.  Days after the President renews his call for the Senate to act on his energy plan, Senator John Kerry (D-MA) is scheduled to deliver a speech on energy to the Center for National Policy.  Kerry will outline his ideas on how to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and voice his criticism of the Bush administration's push to open a portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploration and production.    A federal court judge will hear arguments Tuesday regarding the destruction of Enron-related documents.  The hearing is in response to Amalgamated Bank's request to discover how and why Andersen destroyed Enron-related documents.  We'll have details on the hearing from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   Also from Houston on Tuesday, AES NewEnergy President Clem Palevich discusses deregulation and overcoming problems in the Texas market.  Join us for these reports from Houston.   Tuesday, West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas will discuss the California ISO's new Market Design Project 2002 with Harvard Economist William Hogan.  Hogan says the new plan is a step forward for the California electricity market.  Kym speaks with Hogan during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Major Oil Analyst David Wheeler is also dropping by on Tuesday.  Wheeler will discuss fourth-quarter estimates for the major oil companies live from New York during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Wrap Note: The NYSE was closed Monday due to the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday.  We'll continue with commodity settles on Tuesday when the markets resume trading.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

"Volunteer Opportunity Meeting","
Volunteer Opportunity to become involved in the community and meet professionals throughout Houston 

Become involved in the community and see how you can help change the face of Houston at a meeting hosting the Quality of Life Coalition.  The Quality of Life Coalition is a part of the Gulf Coast Institute, a prominent non-for-profit entity that is engaged in making Houston a better place to live by developing and promoting recreational and environmental amenities (such as running and biking trails like the greenbelt for you Austinites!) that appeal to all parts of the community.  The group is a mixture of local citizens from the civic improvement, business, and environmental communities who would like to improve the fundamental health and economics of the city to be more competitive with other cities.  At the meeting, the president will more specifically discuss the plan for Houston as well as volunteer opportunities for interested and experienced professionals.  

The meeting is:
Tuesday, October 16th
11:30 in 27c2

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

"New Course Offerings","Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.


For registration, please login to our website http://elm.enron.com ""Management/Leadership""    If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Eric,  OPEC Ministers tell ENL International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale they'll make an announcement Thursday morning.  Wolfgang will continue to bring us live coverage from the 117th OPEC Conference in Vienna, Austria Thursday.     From the NASDAQ, TradeSpark Managing Director Mike Williams will join us during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast to discuss the resumption of electronic trading following the terrorist attacks.     The Washington bureau will follow up on the first FERC meeting under new Chairman Pat Wood on Thursday.  The Commission is considering a major push for Regional Transmission Organizations and several other new initiatives.  We'll get some perspective on the meeting from former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, Ph.D. , tomorrow during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.     Congress is on break Thursday, but the Washington bureau will bring us the very latest on efforts in the Senate to force a comprehensive energy bill to the floor.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there are a lot of behind-the-scenes negotiations going on in an effort to see if there's time before the end of the year to consider an energy bill without disrupting the rest of the Senate calendar.    From the Houston bureau on Thursday, we'll have a report on Rice University's work on a satellite that will help detect weather in space several hours before it hits the earth.  ENL's Gale Smith says solar storms can affect power grids and power lines.  Join us for this report on Thursday.   Gale also says a new plan to clean oil spills in Texas is being brought to the table.  Top energy regulators say the new plan came about because the current plan didn't include input from enough of the ""small guys.""  On Thursday, Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Michael Williams talks about the new plan.   From the West Coast bureau Thursday, we'll have the latest on when California Governor Gray Davis plans to call the state legislature back into session to vote on a new Edison bailout plan.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will also bring us an update on the California Department of Water Resources' new payment plan.   Finally, Henwood Energy's North American Consulting Services Managing Director Gary Hunt will join us from the West Coast bureau on Thursday to discuss power plant displacement in California.  He'll also talk about competition between fuels at the margin.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

"Analyst & Associate Program Update","
I want to provide you with an update on current events and their potential effects on members of the Program.

As the business units make decisions about the future course of the company, members of the Program will be affected.  Where positions are eliminated, individuals are being given consideration for other opportunities available within Enron.  Any information communicated to you regarding elimination of your position by the business units will have been coordinated with the Program in advance, and will be definitive.

I know how anxious and frustrating these times are for everyone - they are for my team as well.  The most accurate and timely internal source of information will be communication from the Enron Corp Office of the Chairman.

At this point, no one is certain what the future may bring regarding our careers at Enron.  I do know for certain that each of you is here, because you were selected from ""the very best of the best"".  I appreciate your continuing patience and efforts.

If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (35275), Terry Bosien (35230) or me (36671).

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Details of two major pieces of energy legislation were released this week.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says we'll have more reaction on Friday to the Senate Democrats' comprehensive energy bill. We'll also have reaction to House Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton's electricity legislation.  Barton talked about the legislation on ENL Thursday afternoon and you can watch that interview in its entirety in ENL's Video Library.  On Friday during the noon ET newscast we'll hear what the American Public Power Association thinks of the bill.   The Washington bureau will also take a closer look at the debate over vehicle fuel economy standards.  A hearing took place on Thursday in the Senate.  We'll bring you the follow-up on Friday.    We'll also have the latest on the Enron situation from Washington.  Company Chairman Ken Lay is currently scheduled to participate in a hearing on the Hill next week.   On Friday, Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says we'll speak with Ann Baker Ronn and Karen Churchfield of the AFP Financial Planning Group.  They'll join us to discuss what effect the Enron business dealings are having on 401(k) programs.  Ronn and Churchfield will also discuss retirement savings and ways to avoid going down with the company in bad situations.    The electronic trading organization Tradespark is rebuilding after devastating staff losses in the attacks from September 11. On Friday, the Houston bureau will speak with Tradespark Managing Director Michael Williams about the companies operations after 9/11.   We'll also have more from the Gulf of Mexico offshore drilling conference in Houston.  Companies at the conference are exhibiting the latest technology and information from the offshore business sector.     We've got more live coverage on Friday from Platts' Day of the Trader Conference in Las Vegas.  Don't miss reports from West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas, live from the conference tomorrow.     Closing Prices for Thursday, Dec. 6, 2001    Crude: $18.54/bbl -$0.95   Unleaded: $0.5175/gallon -$0.0245   Heating Oil: $0.5066/gallon -$0.0248   Gas: $2.565/mmBtu +$0.074   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Hey there, I got a call from Marta in your HR about some type of ""Financial
Portfolio Managment"" deal.  The VP is TIm Kramer.  It sounded like some
type of Risk and Control, analytical position as opposed to trading.  So I
told here I was not interested for now.  Anyway just wondering if you knew
anything about this group, if it's something I should look at.  Thanks
buddy.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at either Congressional hearing this week.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committee is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as Tuesday morning.  Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoenas as well.  A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarantee he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak.   Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three hearings scheduled for Tuesday morning.  One of the hearings involves Enron board member William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal investigation at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was highly critical of the company's management team.  We'll have highlights from Powers' testimony on Tuesday from Washington.   Unsecured creditors can help ensure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claims trading.  That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins.  He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to discuss the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will receive some sort of payment.   Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas Pipeline CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September 11. He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines.   We'll have more from the one-on-one interview between West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas and California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch.  Kym says Lynch will discuss the ongoing negotiations with generators to rework the state's long-term power contracts.    Closing Prices for Monday, Feb. 4, 2002    Crude: $20.07/bbl -$0.31   Unleaded: $0.5931/gallon -$0.0103   Heating Oil: $0.5381/gallon -$0.0150   Gas: $2.117/mmBtu -$0.021   Fwd uE(Mar.): $3.57/mmBtu +$0.05   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Just a couple of housecleaning issues.","
As you have heard,  we are working with creditors to shore up our creditworthiness due to the recent cash crunch.  We have been successful in addressing most of the fears of certain counterparties who were reluctant to trade with us.    The Power and Gas Trading floors have been supporting the profitability of the entire company for the last three years at least,  so it is my personal belief that we will still have plenty of opportunity in this department,  ie courting new service customers and continuing to build the Teco/Frontera relationship.  I have been working  with the physical RT traders and selling/buying  the financial swap;   this has held great interest in the market.
I realize and understand that it is tough to read the papers and wonder what is happening - but,  for the new employees, this means getting in on the ground floor.
This is a huge business and we expect to get back to our roots:  TRADING.    We will have to tough this one out.  

We are,  however,  avoiding expenditures as evidenced by the food service being cancelled.     All personal cell phone expenses that had been previously turned in on an expense report will no longer be honored for Real time workers.     Additionally,  expenses related to happy hours,  etc will not be honored unless previously approved.

I also have to mention:

The chairs for the traders (and myself)  have been moving around.   Some of these chairs have been acquired specifically for employees with lower back issues,  etc.
Dont borrow chairs from the traders because they are not being returned.   If other RT groups are borrowing them,  this must stop.
Some chairs are never to be seen again.   This defies logic.   It sounds a bit petty,  but when you come in for work at  5:30 am,  the last thing you want to do is find your chair or at least one that is not broken.    

We are soon to have a meeting to discuss the Hourly QSE MOS system.    We are revising it again to make it simpler.

Also,   on Sunday November 18th,  we are to be testing the computers in the new building.   The Sunday day shift trader will trade in this building.    I will be at the new building, testing paralell until the night shift arrives.   The night shift will report to the new building on the 18th.  We will be cleaning up around our workspace starting this Friday. 

Additionally,   a new schedule has been implemented.   The changes affect only George Phillips and Isaac Wong.   We need to delete all other test versions of the schedule.



Thanks for hanging in there,
JMF

Welcome to Advantage, the new monthly newsletter from the Associate & Analyst Program. We're a big family - we have close to 850 associates and analysts working all over the globe - and we want to keep you current on what's going on. We have new programs, perspectives and opportunities to tell you about, as well as births, marriages and social events. We know you don't have much time, so we will use this newsletter as a quick way to stay in touch.

We're welcoming our latest class of 200 or so Associates and Analysts who have recently joined Enron. Newcomers and ""old-timers"" will find that the A&A Program is a great foundation for their careers at Enron. Some of our activities are learning experiences, and some are just plain fun. But they all help to build your network within Enron, which you will draw on frequently in the years ahead.

So here's to a great Fall. I look forward to seeing some of you this month at our pizza and brown-bag lunches and at other occasions. Let me know how things are going. And let's stay in touch.

Regards,
Billy Lemmons 
VP/ A&A Program

Fall Recruiting Season Kick-off
It's a great time to be recruiting new Associates and Analysts to Enron. While other organizations have cut back on new hires, Enron's appetite for new talent remains robust. In this environment, we expect to recruit the best of the best. We're visiting a broader list of universities than ever before. In the past we may have preferred hiring students from only a select group of schools.  The reality is that we value diversity and top performers come from many different schools.  As such, we think it is best to cast a wider, shallower net, rather than go too deep into the talent pool in only a few places.  

We need your help. The A&A program is introducing a more targeted approach to recruiting, so we can focus on the best prospects. We would like to use you, and others like you - alumni, former residents of the state and people who are just excited to be at Enron - to ""close the deal"" by communicating our story. Nothing's better than personal experience to prove that the opportunities here truly are limitless. If you are interested in helping out, e-mail Traci Warner at traci.warner@enron.com <mailto:traci.warner@enron.com>. 


The Quarterly Event Is Now a Chance to Help
Wednesday, Sept. 19, was supposed to be a night of joy, a chance for everyone to welcome our new Associates and Analysts at our first Houston Quarterly Event at Bossa. In light of last week's terror and destruction, we are turning the occasion into a kick-off of a week-long book drive. We are asking pool members to purchase a children's book and inscribe a special message to a child who has been touched by this tragedy. We hope this small act of hope and caring gives emotional support to families during this time of need.

If you would like to make a cash donation to help with Enron's relief effort, matching gift forms will be available at the gathering, and Enron will match your contribution 2 to 1.

For more information or to reserve your place, please RSVP to Donna Jones at ext. 3-3175 or Jackie Coleman at ext. 5-4070.

The Book Drive at Bossa
Sept. 19 from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  ENL will be live in Vienna, Austria this week, as International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale reports from the extraordinary OPEC meeting on Wednesday.  Wolfgang will bring us coverage from the meeting and the very latest on any possible production cuts.    In advance of the OPEC meeting, Prudential Securities Energy Analyst Aaron Kildow will join us from New York during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast on Tuesday.  Kildow will give us his insight on Russia's announcement of production cuts and the upcoming OPEC meeting.     Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the debate over energy legislation should move to the floor of the Senate Tuesday.  The Senate will begin looking at an economic stimulus bill and Republicans are expected to offer comprehensive energy legislation as an amendment to the package.  Democrats and Republicans scheduled news conferences tomorrow to preview the debate to come.     Peter also says we'll have more from an energy conference taking place in Washington this week.  Among other things, the conference will look at the FERC's development of Regional Transmission Organizations.     Finally from Washington, we'll have the latest on the plane crash in  New York and any new developments as they arise.   On Tuesday the California Senate Committee investigating price manipulation in the state's wholesale electricity market will hold a hearing focusing on complaints by generators that the California ISO has given preferential treatment to the CDWR. Cal ISO President and CEO Terry Winter received a subpoena to attend the meeting.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will have all the details from the West Coast bureau Tuesday.    UBS PaineWebber First Vice President of Investments Robert Young will join us in the Houston bureau on Tuesday.  Young has followed the progress of both Kinder Morgan and Enron and will compare the two companies and how they've changed in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   We also have Conoco Project Manager Ken Smith penciled in at the Houston bureau on Tuesday.  Conoco is one of eight companies working on a joint venture for subsea mud lift drilling technology.  The technology has been successfully tested and is now in the marketing stage.  Smith will stop by during the noon ET newscast.   The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition continues its First Energy Summit on Tuesday.  The Houston bureau will be in attendance bringing us coverage from the electric deregulation and oil and gas sessions.  Log on for coverage of the summit tomorrow.   Video Library Update: The Reverend Jesse Jackson stopped by the Houston bureau to discuss the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's First Energy Summit.  If you happened to miss it, jump into the Video Library to catch the interview in full.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.    Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Eric Saibi (Off-Peak Trader for ERCOT) wants to change the last line in all the off-peak products to read ""Saturday or Sunday, or any day that is a NERC holiday"" from ""Saturday or Sunday,  including any day that is a NERC holiday"".  Can you please run it by legal and have it changed???  If you have any questions please contact Eric or myself.

Thanks in advance

"Your Role in Computer Virus Protection","As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  There are several hearings and at least one markup scheduled on Wednesday from Capitol Hill.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook reports members of Congress will be considering the expansion of alternative energy production on federal lands and looking at ways to improve safety at nuclear plants.    Also on Wednesday, CTN, INGAA and the AGA are sponsoring a major energy conference.  Panelists at the conference include FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell, energy attorney and former FERC Commissioner Don Santa and Curt Launer of Credit Suisse First Boston among others.  The Washington bureau will have updates from the conferences Wednesday morning.   Also from the Washington bureau, National Academy of Sciences Senior Program Officer Alan Crane will stop by to give us a preview of the hearing on Friday revisiting CAFE standards.  He'll join us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.     The Houston bureau will have an update on Rep. Joe Barton (R) Texas, and a portion of his electricity bill concerning Regional Transmission Organizations that's expected to be released soon. Rep. Barton also talks about ERCOT, operators of 85% of the Texas power grid, and how the organization is a model for these RTOs.    Jacobs Consultancy Incorporated Managing Director  Karl Bartholomew will join us from the Houston bureau on Wednesday. He'll discuss how the industry will be affected by lowering the sulfur content in diesel fuel during the noon ET newscast tomorrow.   On Wednesday from the West Coast bureau, California Governor  Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio talks about what compromises are being made to push a Southern California Edison bailout plan through the State Legislature.   ENL's Kym McNicholas says we'll also have more on the California PUC's decision on the CDWR Rate Agreement and reaction from the Governor's office.  And California ISO Spokesperson Gregg Fishman responds to concerns that the grid operator has violated the FERC's orders on creditworthiness.  Log on Wednesday for these reports from the West Coast bureau.   Daily Update Note: You can now send today's Daily Update to a friend.

"Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary","I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

"SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  Another Congressional hearing into the Enron collapse is scheduled for next week, with the focus falling on energy.  The Senate Energy Committee will look into what impact Enron's demise has had on energy markets.  The Washington bureau will have complete coverage of Enron developments on Capitol Hill.   The White House could find a lawsuit on its doorstep next week.  General Accounting Office Comptroller General David Walker says he could decide as early as Wednesday whether to sue Vice President Cheney over the administration's decision not to turn over more information regarding the work of his energy task force.  The GAO has never filed a similar lawsuit in its history, but Vice President Cheney maintains the request is inappropriate.     FERC Chairman Pat Wood addresses a meeting of the American Public Power Association in Washington on Monday.  The Washington bureau will have details on the APPA meeting and coverage of the regular FERC meeting on Wednesday.  The FERC meeting includes a closed-door session on the start of a possible FERC investigation.    There's another whistleblower in the Enron case - on Monday, the Houston bureau will speak with the attorney for a woman who says she knew there were problems at Enron.  We'll also have updates on the investigation into the death of a former Enron executive.    On Monday, ENL's Kym McNicholas talks to Phoenix Consulting's Susan Schneider about some recent California ISO filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Schneider will also discuss the California Power Authority's Energy Resource Investment Plan.   Williams Energy Partners L.P. CFO Don Wellendorf joins us on Monday.  Wellendorf will discuss Williams Energy Partners' fourth-quarter earnings during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.    Closing Prices for Friday, Jan. 25, 2002    Crude: $19.99/bbl +$0.29   Unleaded: $0.5828/gallon +$0.0143   Heating Oil: $0.5373/gallon +$0.0034   Gas: $2.037/mmBtu -$0.011   Fwd uE(Feb.): $3.44/mmBtu -$0.05   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.  Have a great weekend!  Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

We'll have details from these stories and more on Tuesday from the West Coast bureau.   From Columbus, Ohio, AEP Spokesperson Pat Hemlepp will discuss AEP's earnings report due out Tuesday.  Hemlepp will also bring us an update on changes at AEP's payment processing center in the wake of the anthrax scares, and the importance of electronic payments, during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.

"CA/TX  reads","40 percent of Texans Plan to Try Electricity Competition: When the gates to deregulation open on January 1, 2002, the race to choose a new energy supplier will begin in the Texas market. According to a recent Scripps Howard Texas poll, there will be plenty of consumers ready to make the switch. The poll predicts that 40 percent of Texans are likely to switch their electric providers when the state markets open to competition. Results also showed that a majority of Texans agree that there should be more competition in the states electric power industry.

Texas Deregulation Gets More Kudos: Texas' deregulation plan is receiving praise yet again as a successful approach to deregulation. The Retail Energy Deregulation Index (RED Index), a scorecard developed by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM), lists Texas' deregulation plan as second only to Pennsylvania's deregulation approach. According to Ken Malloy, CEO of CAEM, Texas is primed for a successful transition to a competitive electric retail market. CAEM, an independent, non-profit, Washington, DC based, think-tank specializing in energy competition policies produces the Retail Energy Deregulation Index (RED Index). 

Electric Choice Stalled in California: California's ongoing struggle to get above their problems with deregulation has finally came to a head. On September 20, the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) suspended direct access until the Department of Water Resources no longer supplies power to the customers in California. The PUC's decision to take away direct access was deemed necessary to help the state pay for the upcoming 12.5 billion bond issue planned for later this year and to help pay off the states outstanding debt for energy purchased by the Department of Water Resources. 

Although consumers can no longer change electricity providers, companies who already hold energy agreements will continue to receive service through the end of their contracts. EES is continuing to move forward in the California market with sales of natural gas procurement and delivery and many other services that are still needed in the region. With California consumers temporarily unable to seek the best price for power, services such as business risk management, distributed generation, and energy efficiency improvement services will become customers only outlet for achieving energy savings.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The final Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting of 2001 will dominate our coverage from the Washington bureau on Wednesday.  The agenda is packed, and includes discussion on the California refunds case and a proposal to change accounting standards for energy companies.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says we should also hear more on the development of Regional Transmission Organizations at the meeting.   Lawmakers are preparing to leave town for the holidays. Republicans and Democrats are still trying to reach a deal on an economic stimulus package before they head home - so far there's no agreement.  We'll follow these stories from the Washington bureau on Wednesday, and have more on possible Congressional action in the wake of the Enron implosion.    Enron's collapse is affecting companies across the board, forcing some to reassess their balance sheets.  On Wednesday from Houston, Jacobs Consultancy Managing Director Joe Ramsey will discuss how they account for their bottom lines.  Join us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast for the Ramsey interview.   Director of the University of Houston Energy Institute Michelle Foss, Ph.D. , talks about what's next in the wake of Enron's fall.   Foss will join us from Houston during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.     Also on Wednesday, West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas speaks with Independent Energy Producers Association Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones.

I apologize for the mass email to everybody. Some  of you are hearing from me out of the blue and others I may not have kept in  touch with quite as much (but neither did you!). In any case I hope you are all  doing well. 
 
As you know I have been working from home these  past few months - it's been nice; but I have started to get quite a few crank  calls, at odd hours. Therefore, from now on, you will not be able to get a voice  response at my old number (949) 387-9492 - this will be my fax. My voice number  will be (949) 387-9493. Sometimes in this high tech world its nice to just have  to switch the plugs!! (of course I'm also curious to see how long it will be  till the rest of the world will figure this out). I can still also be reached at  my cell phone (949) 307-6512
 
Please, keep these numbers in confidence, and do  not share them with anyone. Thank you all. 
 
Regards,
Adnan Khan
CEO Khan Ventures, LLC

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

"BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser","
Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

"MetrixND Version 3.0","Dear MetrixND Users,

Based on the results of our recent user survey regarding what Windows
platforms you are using, we have decided to eliminate testing and support of
MetrixND version 3.0 on Windows 95.  The small fraction of you that are
currently running a Windows 95 environment will need to upgrade to at least
Windows 98 to run MetrixND version 3.0.  RER will still support previous
versions of MetrixND that run on Windows 95, however we encourage all users
to run the most current version.

MetrixND version 3.0 will be tested on the following platforms:

  -Windows 98
  -Windows 2000
  -Windows NT version 4.0 or higher
  -Windows ME
  -Windows XP

If you have any questions, please contact Frank Monforte or me.

"Solar Migration - Very Important","
	During the weekend of October 6 and 7, 2001 the Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating all production users off the current hardware (Solar) that houses their home and application directories (no production databases are effected) to new hardware.	

	This migration requires a total system outage of approximately 4 hours.  The outage will occur Friday night - Saturday morning between the hours of Midnight to 4:00 AM.  All users will need to be logged off during this time period.  If this is not possible, contact Adam DeRidder (x3-1428) or Carlos Uribe (x5-8179) as soon as possible.
	In order to validate the migration, production users need to test access to their home directories and applications on Saturday, October 7 and Sunday, October 8, 2001.

	As part of the migration plan, the Storage Team needs volunteers from the production community to test the new environment.  The test will only require approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.  Adam DeRidder and Carlos Uribe have setup a test lab on the 34th floor for this purpose.  Contact Adam to setup a time.  Your involvement will help make this a successful migration.

	A list of contacts will be made available on Thursday, October 5, 2001.  Please use this list to report issues and check the status of the migration.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Congressional interest in the collapse of Enron is growing. We'll have updates from the Washington bureau on Tuesday on the various committees looking into the company's problems.  The first hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in the House Financial Services Committee and Enron Chairman Ken Lay has been invited to participate.   The Federal Reserve's Open Markets Committee meets Tuesday to make a decision on interest rates.  The Washington bureau will have the latest for us if and when the Fed decides to cut interest rates for the 11th time this year.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook is also watching the status of any economic stimulus package from Congress.  Peter says signs indicate lawmakers could leave town for the year without a stimulus plan in place.     We'll have more on the Senate Democratic energy bill on Tuesday.  Renewable Fuels Association Communications Director Monte Shaw will talk about what the legislation will mean for the ethanol industry.  I'll speak with Shaw during the noon ET newscast tomorrow.   Also Tuesday, President Bush marks the three-month anniversary of the September 11th attacks.  He'll participate in a White House ceremony before heading to South Carolina to deliver what the White House is calling a major address Tuesday afternoon at The Citadel.   TradeSpark's Michael Williams will talk on Tuesday about his company's efforts to rebuild operations after the attacks of September 11.  The online trading operation was one of the hardest hit in the tragedy.     Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says they'll speak with TechKnowledge Consulting Corporation's Dave Jacobs on Tuesday. Jacobs will stop by the bureau to talk about disaster preparedness and recovery for energy companies.  Join us tomorrow for these interviews from the Houston bureau.    Closing Prices for Monday, Dec. 10, 2001    Crude: $18.37/bbl -$0.67   Unleaded: $0.5109/gallon -$0.141   Heating Oil: $0.5066/gallon -$0.102   Gas: $2.747/mmBtu +$0.179   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

"Outlook Communication","Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our email environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that we have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues. 
?	During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exchange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug, which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the better part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which appears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchange servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?	Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experienced database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Outlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchange servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected server.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use -- we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems with the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the business week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to move users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impacted users could not access their e-mail.
?	During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and dangerous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against viruses that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktops.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day.  The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but we believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron computing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this time, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as the performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the last few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  ENL will have the latest on the American Gas Association's decision Friday to end its weekly storage reports.   The Washington bureau will have the very latest on the progress of comprehensive energy legislation in Congress.  The big sticking point in the Senate continues to be the proposal to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Bush administration officials are promising to keep the pressure on.   Peter also says there are several specific energy issues being debated on the Hill next week.  A House Committee vote on renewing the Price Anderson Act, which provides insurance for the nuclear industry, should be back on the agenda after a delay this week.     Representative Doug Ose's (R)-California, Government Reform Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs will be looking at natural gas capacity and infrastructure constraints.  The Washington bureau will have news from these events and others on the Hill next week.   ENL's Gale Smith says the bureau will be packed next week with interviews starting Monday.  Pace Consultants Director Dan Foley is stopping by to talk about the effects of a U.S. MTBE ban on other countries that import gasoline during the noon ET newscast.   A memorial service will be held in downtown Houston Monday evening to honor the employees of TradeSpark, eSpeed and Cantor Fitzgerald killed in the September 11 attacks in New York.  The Houston bureau will bring us a report from the service on Tuesday.   On Thursday next week, IBM Chemical & Petroleum Industry Vice President of Marketing Craig Hodges is stopping by the Houston bureau.  Hodges will bring us details on Shell Oil's selection of IBM to pilot the ""e-Station"" prototype that would create wireless gas stations.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas will speak with Wright & Talisman Attorney Mike Small from Washington, D.C., on Monday. Small will give his reaction to the results of the Western Systems Power Pool Conference during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Kym also says we'll have more from former Secretary of State  James Baker and British Airways Chairman Lord Marshall, both speakers at the Invensys Conference, next week.   Jefferies & Company Electricity Utility Analyst Paul Fremont is penciled in from New York.  Fremont will discuss PG&E's bankruptcy reorganization and whether bankruptcy status makes PG?a better investment than Edison.  Catch Fremont in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast on Monday.   Programming note: On Monday, ENL's weather team will bring you advance temperature readings from the U.S. National Weather Service's MRF model.  With these new maps, we'll have the most accurate temperature readings for up to eight days out.  Log on Monday for forward-looking weather data from ENL.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  We'll have live reports from Capitol Hill on the latest Enron hearing as the Senate Energy Committee takes its first look at the energy-related questions raised by the company's collapse. Among witnesses scheduled to attend are Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman James Newsome, and Vincent Viola, the head of the NYMEX. Lawmakers are deciding whether new legislation changes may be needed in the aftermath.     A legal fight is brewing between the White House and the General Accounting Office over the work of Vice President Cheney's energy task force.  Cheney is refusing to release more details on with whom the task force met and the substance of those talks.  The head of the GAO says he may be forced to file a lawsuit as early as Wednesday to obtain the information.     Finally from Washington, President Bush will deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday evening.  The Washington bureau will look at what we can expect from the speech regarding energy policy.   It's earnings time, and we'll continue to check in with companies from the Houston bureau.  On Tuesday during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, Parker Drilling Company President and CEO Robert Parker, Jr. joins us to discuss his company's fourth quarter 2001.  Also, Merrill Lynch-Houston Director Carl Kirst is stopping by during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast to bring us an analysis of a compilation of earnings, including Williams and Dynegy.     We'll have more earnings reports from Tulsa as well - Williams Energy Services President and CEO Steve Malcolm will bring us his numbers first-hand from ENL headquarters during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.     Is fuel cell technology moving fast enough?  In Tuesday's special ENL Team Report, we'll take a look at fuel cells, their development, and potential for use.  Houston and Sacramento profile the technology, and talk to those working with it already.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas goes into the desert, where researchers are working hard to make fuel cells more practical for consumers.  From our Houston bureau, Correspondent Kim Benestante shows where fuel cells are actually being used.  The technology is being developed on the Gulf Coast, and is being put to use in Alaska.  Don't miss this ENL Special Report on Tuesday.    Closing Prices for Monday, Jan. 28, 2002    Crude: $20.05/bbl +$0.06   Unleaded: $0.5811/gallon -$0.0017   Heating Oil: $0.5313/gallon -$0.0060   Gas: $1.908/mmBtu -$0.129   Fwd uE(Feb.): $3.36/mmBtu -$0.10   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

"Hi!","Hi!  I just got back from Germany!  It was a pleasant trip but things in
Frankfurt are just so expensive.  I went there for a distributor's meeting,
and had the opportunity to meet the people that we are having correspondence
with over fax and e-mail in the past.  Our account officer is a pretty girl
and she is only 23 years old.  The downside is that she is married for one
year already.  Oh well, life's tough.  I think one of the other distributors
noticed me flirting with this girl.  Well, a quarter of the way around the
world should be fair game.  Anyway, I was surprised that Frankfurt wasn't
that big of a city.  You can walk from the main parts of the city in a few
minutes.  Mostly, they only have Churches (every five blocks there seems to
be one), slaughterhouses, and castles.  In fact, they have been preserving
so many allegedly historical buildings.  These are ugly ass buildings that
have no apparent architectural appeal.  Due to this, the new European
Central Bank buildings has to be built at the back of one of these alleged
historical sites.  The building is long and takes up too much prime space
with no apparent purpose whatsoever.  This seems to be a prevalent site in
most of Frankfurt.  A pleasant surprise during my trip was that the company
paid for my hotel room.  I was prepared to pay for it, but I wasn't charged
when I checked-out.

Our meeting lasted from Monday to Thursday, which left Friday and Saturday
free for me before my flight on Sunday.  I decided to join a city tour by
bus to Rothenburg.  Well, I was initially set on going to Heidelberg but I
met this American Chinese girl who was travelling alone and I decided to
just accompany her to Rothenburg.  She works in Santa Clara for some upstart
IT company.  I told my girlfriend about it because nothing really happened
aside from us spending the whole of Friday and Saturday together.  Then
again, I am not sure what I would have told her if something did happen ;-)

I'm seriously thinking of taking my Masters in Finance here in the
University of the Philippines.  However, the application forms would only be
available every May and the exam would be in August.  It would be a one-year
course starting September, which would time my graduation right about when
Claudine finishes her local board exams.  I guess I don't see a bright
future here in the Philippines, and I may just follow her when she
specializes in the States or Canada.  Unless something drastic happens and
our country just progresses rapidly, or my stars change, I think that this
would be the plan that I would take.  I guess her petitioning me for a
Canadian citizenship would help a lot in getting a job in Canada or the US.
I'm pretty sure that the US economy would pick-up after two years.  You guys
never stay down!  My country is sinking because of the ever-divided people.
There is no unity and I would suggest for us to just divide the goddamn
country - one for the Muslims, one for the Chinese, and one for the Spanish
people - then we call it the Divided States of the Philippines!!!

Oh well, I'm just ranting right now.  Just write when you have the time.
Have you spoken to Khan lately?  Tell his ass to write me!  I haven't heard
from him for quite some time now.  I hope he is okay.  Send him my regards.

"Media Reports","
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

"Associate / Analyst Program","
After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called ""PACE"", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

"FW: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel","

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will be live from the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The focal theme this year is ""Energy markets: The challenges of the new millennium.""  Catch live reports from the first day of the 18th World Energy Congress on Monday.   Congress returns to Washington Monday amid continuing concern over the anthrax threat on Capitol Hill.  Both the House and Senate are expected to resume their normal schedule, which includes some action on energy.  There are hearings scheduled on the Price Anderson Act, reducing vehicle fuel consumption and MTBE.  The main action, however, will be behind the scenes in the Senate where Republicans and Democrats still differ on whether there's time to consider a comprehensive energy bill this year.  We'll bring you more details next week.    A summit on energy efficiency is also taking place next week from Washington.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D)-New Mexico and Representative  Ed Markey (D)-Massachusetts will be among the speakers at the event. We'll have all the details from the summit next week.   Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us a report Monday on Texas wind power projects.  Kim says federal and state laws helped get the idea off the ground, and now demand for wind power is allowing the market to do very well.  Kim will have all the details of wind generation success in Texas on Monday.      The Houston bureau will also have a report on how refiners will keep gasoline inventories well supplied once MTBE is phased out. Right now, MTBE makes up 10 percent of the U.S. gasoline pool.  Once the blending component is banned, refiners will look to isooctane to help supplement gasoline supplies.  Jacobs Consultancy's Dan Foley will talk about the role of isooctane on Monday.   Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz tells West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas, California's energy supply crisis is understandable, but the financial crisis is not.  Kym also talks one-on-one with former California Governor Pete Wilson.  He gives a reflective look into what went wrong with the state's deregulation plan and what the state needs to do to recover.   With earnings expected out October 31st, Calpine Corporation CEO Peter Cartwright will talk about his company's growth this quarter compared to this time last year.  He also reacts to word the state may attempt to renegotiate long-term power contracts.  We'll bring you details from the West Coast bureau on Monday.   Get the streamers and balloons ready - Energy News Live is turning one.  You'll want to be sure to log on Tuesday, October 23rd, because in celebration of ENL's one-year anniversary we've scheduled a  star-studded cast of energy industry guests.  Here's a little preview:   Former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, Ph.D.  Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King  FirstCall Director of Research Chuck Hill  Platts Global Director of Oil John Kingston  Petroleum Argus, Inc. President Dan Massey  American Association of Petroleum Geologists Director Rick Fritz   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

"VERY IMPORTANT ENRONONLINE  STACK MANAGER CHANGES","
We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of ""zeros"" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Next week, Washington bureau coverage will be dominated by the questions surrounding a comprehensive energy bill.  Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether there is enough time and support to pass the bill, and Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the dispute could threaten the bipartisan unity currently on the Hill.     While Senators try to resolve that issue, members of Congress are tackling other major energy topics.  Next week, the Senate Energy Committee will hold a hearing on the proposed natural gas pipeline connecting the lower 48 states to Alaska.  Also, the House Resources Committee will look into using federal land for renewable energy production.   CTN is sponsoring a major energy conference in Washington on Wednesday.  Vice President Dick Cheney, FERC Commissioner  Nora Mead Brownell and Williams CEO Keith Bailey are among those invited to the conference.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  On Friday, the Washington bureau will have more from FERC Chairman Pat Wood on some of the changes he's proposing at the Commission.  Wood and his colleagues are considering dramatic steps to compel utilities to join Regional Transmission Organizations.  Wood will be the guest of honor at a newsmakers breakfast hosted by Energy Daily and the Washington bureau will have all the details Friday.     Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook will bring us the latest on the growing fight in Congress over energy legislation.  Peter says Republicans and Democrats in the Senate continue to battle over whether to bring a comprehensive energy bill to the floor before the end of the year.  Both sides say it's a priority, but Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle argues there may not be time to pass an energy bill with the current demands on Congress.  One issue continuing to divide the two sides is proposed drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  The Teamsters have broken with the Democrats over ANWR, and at  11:00 a.m. ET tomorrow we'll find out why from Jerry Hood, the Teamsters Special Assistant on Energy.   Dain Rauscher Wessels Equity Research Analyst Stephen Smith will join us from the Houston bureau on Friday.  Smith will discuss energy stocks and explain why now is the time to buy.  He'll be on during the noon ET newscast.   Also from Houston, we'll have a report on Enron's online trading business.  ENL's Gale Smith reports, the online service is saving the company millions of dollars.  On Friday, one industry analyst will explain how this is possible.  Join us from Houston for all the details tomorrow.   Midwest Generation Vice President of Public Affairs Doug McFarlan will join us from Chicago on Friday.  He'll bring us a strike update and a possible announcement during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Programming note: Catch the latest commentary from former Deputy Secretary Assistant of Energy Dr. Dennis O'Brien on EnergyPulse, every Friday after each newscast.

Until further,  it is best to avoid long positions in the morning hours that are to liquidate against the balancing market.    The downside is $1000 and the upside maybe $10.

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

"Analyst & Associate Program Update","
I want to provide you with an update on current events and their potential effects on members of the Program.

As the business units make decisions about the future course of the company, members of the Program will be affected.  Where positions are eliminated, individuals are being given consideration for other opportunities available within Enron.  Any information communicated to you regarding elimination of your position by the business units will have been coordinated with the Program in advance, and will be definitive.

I know how anxious and frustrating these times are for everyone - they are for my team as well.  The most accurate and timely internal source of information will be communication from the Enron Corp Office of the Chairman.

At this point, no one is certain what the future may bring regarding our careers at Enron.  I do know for certain that each of you is here, because you were selected from ""the very best of the best"".  I appreciate your continuing patience and efforts.

If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (35275), Terry Bosien (35230) or me (36671).

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	   Dear Eric,  I'm Jay Rickerts, back from vacation feeling refreshed and rejuvenated - I hope everyone had a great holiday season.   ENL's Washington bureau is scheduled to sit down with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood on Tuesday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook tells me he will ask Wood about some of the major issues facing the Commission in 2002.  Also, former FERC Commissioner Don Santa joins us during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast to provide his insight on the future of the FERC. Peter also says the FERC will resume work Tuesday on the California refund case - we'll bring you an update.   The attorneys general of nine northeastern states are hosting a news conference regarding emissions policy on Tuesday.  Peter says the group is expected to warn the Bush administration their states will consider legal action against the federal government if a pending review of the nation's emissions rules leads to a relaxation of enforcement against power plants and refineries.  Join us for this report from the Washington bureau.   We've got more on the FERC for you from the Houston bureau on Tuesday.  Kim Benestante will speak with Gulfstream Communications Director Chris Stockton about his company's FERC filing.  We'll get details from Stockton during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Also from Houston, Paragon Engineering Director of Business Development Barbara Thompson will join us at noon ET to discuss pipeline safety.  She'll bring us an update on the federal deadline coming up in March 2002 regarding ""high-consequence areas"" for pipelines.   Finally, Raymond James & Associates Managing Director Marshall Adkins says the current energy situation isn't like the last downturn in 1998, but more like the bust of 1972 - '73. Adkins will give us an explanation at 2:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas will bring us an update Tuesday on the California legislature's return to session for 2002.  Kym also tells me California Governor Gray Davis' State of the State address is set for Tuesday evening.  Davis is expected to address last year's energy crisis in California and what they expect this year.   We'll also have more from California ISO Manager of Market Design Lorenzo Kristov as he talks to Kym about the ISO's new plan scheduled for release on Tuesday.  Don't miss these reports from Sacramento tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Monday, Jan. 7, 2002    Crude: $21.48/bbl -$0.14   Unleaded: $0.6234/gallon -$0.0050   Heating Oil: $0.5719/gallon -$0.0140   Gas: $2.272/mmBtu -$0.003   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.

"FW: Frontera Resource Plan - Min/Max MWs","
FYI,
This morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.    Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.    I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.    We ran at 280,  but our resource plan was not updated.     Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.   It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.

The point is,   the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.    We must reflect our true minimums at all times.    If the situation changes intraday,  we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.

Subject:	Frontera Resource Plan - Min/Max MWs
Importance:	High

All,

ERCOT is questioning us the resource plan we put in the MOS, especially the Min/Max MWs for STG001. If we only have one CT running, then the Min/Max for ST would be 58/80 MWs instead of 130/184 MWs. Here is a list of points I got from Frontera for your reference:

1. One CT running:
	CTG101		STG001
MW	80		58
MW	100		64
MW	110		66
MW	120		68
MW	130		70
MW	140		74
MW	150		80

2. Both CT's running:
	CTG101		CTG201		STG001
MW	80		80		130
MW	100		100		140
MW	110		110		148
MW	120		120		151
MW	130		130		154
MW	140		140		158
MW	150		150		165

If you have questions, please let me know. Thanks.

"RE: Hi!","Thanks for the invitation.  I'll make sure that a trip to Houston will be
part of my itinerary when I go to the US.  I'm glad that Jennifer and you
are going out.  It's always never the same, but hopefully it will turn out
for the best.  I believe my girlfriend wants to be either a pediatrician or
a dermatologist.  I don't really know what she wants to do, but she'll be
taking the US MLE sometime next year.  I guess we'll have to see what
happens then.  I'll just write more soon.  We have a guest from Taiwan and
one from Australia that we have to entertain today.  It's gonna be one long
freaking day.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   On Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Washington on the final day of the FERC's weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations.  Participants have told our bureau the workshop has been productive and tomorrow we'll find out how the meetings might impact FERC's implementation of RTOs.  Former FERC Commissioner Don Santa will give us his thoughts during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast on where RTOs stand now.   We'll also get more reaction to the nomination of Joe Kelliher to fill the open seat at the FERC.  Gay Friedmann of the INGAA will give us her thoughts on Kelliher's nomination during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Finally from Washington on Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Congress on energy legislation.  The anthrax scare has impacted an already crowded Congressional calendar and there's mixed opinion in the Senate on whether lawmakers there will vote on a comprehensive energy bill this year.     ENL's Gale Smith reports, a major energy company is launching a  one-of-a-kind Web site to buy fuel.  The unique idea behind this is that customers helped develop the site.  Motiva Vice President of Commercial Marketing and Distribution Ralph Grimmer talks about the site from the Houston bureau on Friday.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on Sakonnet Technology on Friday.  Sakonnet was started by a handful of former employees from JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch and has found success by being able to offer the same level of support as more established investment banks - for less money.  Join us tomorrow from the Houston bureau for all the details on Sakonnet.      From the West Coast bureau, ENL's Kym McNicholas says we'll have word on Friday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's press conference and remarks from his keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's electricity crisis.       California Governor Gray Davis is expected to announce his administration's strategy to attempt renegotiation of the long-term power contracts the state signed between January and September of this year with electricity providers.  Log on for these stories and more from the West Coast bureau.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The second of two hearings in the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee on Representative Joe Barton's (R-TX) electricity bill will be held on Thursday.  At the first hearing on Wednesday, all four FERC commissioners commented on Barton's bill.  Several industry trade associations will testify during day two of the hearings.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Rep. Barton believes the legislation will improve restructuring efforts around the country, while some Democrats on the Subcommittee say the bill goes too far.  We'll bring you more on the debate tomorrow.   Peter also says the bureau will have more from the first Congressional hearing into the collapse of Enron.  Wednesday's hearing is expected to be the first of many on the Hill dealing with the fall of Enron.  Join us Thursday for these reports from Washington.   The Houston bureau will also continue to monitor developments surrounding Enron on Thursday.  We'll have the latest on the energy giant's fall from grace, the bankruptcy case, and reaction to the Enron hearings taking place in Washington.    The Texas Supreme Court hears arguments in a utility refund case on Wednesday.  The Houston bureau reports the case could end in a multi-billion dollar refund for the state's power company customers.  We'll have updates from the proceedings tomorrow.   The President of Mirant California Anne Cleary sits down with ENL's Kym McNicholas on Thursday.  They'll discuss the energy industry and what it needs to do to bring the benefits of deregulation to consumers.   Also, Thomas Dehaan, a Vice President with COEN, talks to Kym about the booming combined-cycle power plant industry.  Dehaan discusses how his company is increasing its market share.  Catch reports from the West Coast bureau on Thursday.      Closing Prices for Wednesday, Dec. 12, 2001    Crude: $18.36/bbl +$0.28   Unleaded: $0.5172/gallon +$0.111   Heating Oil: $0.5058/gallon +$0.0059   Gas: $2.719/mmBtu -$0.084   Site News: The National Journal listed ENL as one of the top two Best Energy Web sites in its December 8, 2001 issue.  We're excited about the exposure and want to let you know we appreciate your continued support.  From all of us at ENL - thanks!   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction.   We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate.  There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor.     Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants.  We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday.   Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor.  Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area.  On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies.  We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas.  South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America.    Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter.  Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.   The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access.     Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity.  This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world.  Kym will bring us details on Thursday.   Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15.  Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings.  And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings.  Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got
damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what
""suggestions"" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.
So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not
happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying
sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we
did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something
different?

"GMAT Review available at Enron","GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin the week of October 15th.
Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.  
			Be sure to indicate complete cardholder information.
	3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored.  
Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on awaiting list for the course or courses indicated.
Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"RE: Move Scheduled","Eric,
 
You will not have to do anything....you will be using all of the equipment at Smith's desk.  I have ordered Smith the new equipment he will need.    I marked you down for vac and everything should be set up for you when you return.
 
Thanks Tjae

TJ, I am planning to take all of next week off as vacation.  However since I am on the hourly desk now, I don't really have any hardware or boxes that need to move.  I am assuming that they will put two new machines and several flat screens at the new desk, and set them up like the other traders.  Please let me know if this is not correct or if I need to do anything related to this move.  Thanks.

"FW: IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.","
Please make sure you do the following before you leave tonight....Thanks for your help.  Tjae
 
Subject:	IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.

In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

"Regional Research Projects","All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Tamara:

Eric Saibi has been linked to Enron Power Marketing Inc.  His global ID is:  95063.  GCP does not provide passwords for EOL, the EOL group handles passwords.

Doug:

Per our conversation, we will await to hear from you the specific desk to which you would like Eric linked next week.  There are currently 16 different ""ERCOT"" desks, therefore we need to narrow down to the specific desk.  Feel free to call w/ questions.  Thanks.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

"Enron and United Way's Continued Partnership","
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.  Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.

"Hello :-)","Hi Eric! 
This is Maylynn (Adnan's Fianc?).  I just thought I'd write and ""introduce"" myself to Adnan's best friend.  I also want to tell you that I was thrilled when Adnan told me you'd be able to make it to our wedding.  It really means a lot to both of us that you're coming.  I can't wait to meet you!  We'll definitely have to hang out and share Adnan stories when you get here :-)  Especially since you'll stay at my place (If Adnan's parents are still here). 
Adnan mentioned your single status, and I happen to have one girlfriend who is coming to our wedding by herself.  Please don't get the wrong idea... i just want everyone to enjoy themselves, and you two are the only ones who won't know anyone except myself and Adnan. 
Her name is Jane Lee.  I've known her since I was 14.  We went to high school together, and managed to keep in touch through our collegiate years (She went to UCSD).  She's a very attractive-pretty-energetic-not-your-run-of-the-mill-korean girl.  She's very positive, and lots of fun to hang out with.  She's one of the brightest people I know (Next to my good-looking' fiance of course! - I love embarrassing him:-), outgoing and very humorous.  I just thought I'd give you a quick synopsis of Jane (It's hard to fully describe her in a paragraph though).  And yes! She's attractive. 
If you're interested, please write and I'll be more than happy to tell her about you, or tell you more about her.  If you'd rather stay solo for the evening, that's totally fine as well :-)  Don't worry, I'm not trying to play matchmaker.  But you two are the only ones that don't have another half (All of my attractive girlfriends that are coming are taken [except Jane], and most of our friends are couples) and I don't want you to feel awkward by yourselves.  Like I said, we both want everyone to fully enjoy themselves and have a memorable evening.  So I thought it would be nice if you kept each other company.   
Anyways, I hope to hear from you soon.  Please don't be shy, I'm quite open and very verbal (As you may have heard :-)  So please feel free to write anytime!  Here's my work e-mail (day time 8-5 PST) mmorales@arnel.com 
Ciao!   :-) 
Maylynn 
PS: Adnan said to write: 
""Hey dude, told 'ya i'd hook you up!!! (and she's Asian to boot - who's the man?)""

"FW: Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting","

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  The FERC meets on Wednesday in Washington and bureau chief Peter Cook says the Commission is expected to announce an update on its push for Regional Transmission Organizations.  The deadline for RTO applications is December 15th and Chairman Pat Wood is expected to spell out at the meeting whether that date could change.    Peter says we'll also have the latest on energy legislation in Congress.  The showdown over energy in the Senate could be on hold indefinitely, due in part to the separate fight over the economic stimulus package.   Finally from Washington, President Bush is meeting with more world leaders Wednesday.  The First Deputy Prime Minister of Kuwait, the Foreign Minister of Morocco and Britain's Prime Minister are among those meeting with the President.  We'll keep you updated on those meetings from the Washington bureau.   AEP Principal Communications Consultant Peter Main is stopping by the Houston bureau on Wednesday.  In the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast, he'll discuss the company's wish to postpone deregulation in the Southwest Power Pool of Texas.   We'll also bring you a report on the Texas Legislative Oversight Committee meeting with the Texas PUC and ERCOT.  The meeting will address technical issues that still need to be resolved before electricity competition begins on January 1.  We'll have the report from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us the results from two ballot measures in San Francisco, which would pave the way for the creation of a Municipal Utility District.  PG? warns if voters approve the public power initiatives, it will tie the measures up in a lengthy court battle.  Log on Wednesday for more details.   On Tuesday the California Energy Commission held a public workshop: ""Exploring Alternative Wholesale Electricity Market Structures of California.""  The workshop was given to evaluate how alternative market structures can add generation in a timely fashion to reduce price volatility and deliver reliable service.  We'll have all the details from Tuesday's workshop from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   From Chicago on Wednesday, Alaron Trading Vice President and Senior Market Analyst Phil Flynn will join us.  During the noon ET newscast Flynn will bring us an overview of the API and DOE numbers and their effect on commodity prices.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

There will be a UBSWE Migration TONIGHT....please make sure that you LOG OFF before you leave today.  

Monday morning, (2/4/02), you will logon with your Enron NT Account and Password.  You will immediately be forced to change your password (following Enron rules) and your NT ID will stay the same.  Once you've changed your password, and logged off AGAIN, you will see the UBS Warburg Energy Screen....email will not be affected until day one.

Starting Monday, you will receive emails from IT support to explain the HOW TO's for your data that YOU  will need to begin transferring over to UBS.  All material will need to be in compliance with UBS standards and NO documents or emails are to be deleted.  In Outlook the following information will be transferred over by IT: Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Notes.  Emails (Inbox, Sent Items and Deleted Items) and folder structure will NOT be migrated.

ALL data MUST be migrated PRIOR to day one (estimated to be 02/08/02 ), as access to Enron data will be disabled Day 1.

Thanks for your immediate help in this matter.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  It's been a busy week for energy in the nation's capital.  On Friday, we'll have more from hearings dealing with potential federal emissions curbs and the future of MTBE.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says he will have the latest on the fight over energy legislation in the U.S. Senate.   Former Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson is scheduled to join us from the Washington bureau Friday at 3:00 p.m. ET to discuss energy issues in Washington.  We hope to get his insight on the current debate over energy happening in the Senate and the state of the nation's energy infrastructure.   Society of Independent Gas Marketers of America Communications Director Tom Osborne will drop by the Washington bureau on Friday. Osborne will talk about how independent gasoline marketers will be affected by the EPA's proposal to streamline the transition between winter- and summer-grade fuels.  Log on during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast to catch Osborne.   Also from Washington, Center for Strategic and International Studies Energy and National Security Director Robert Ebel will discuss the world energy markets since the September 11th attacks.  He'll also try to shed some light during the noon ET newscast on what we can expect in oil markets over the next six months.   We'll have another earnings report from the Houston bureau on Friday. GulfMark Offshore Incorporated Executive Vice President Ed Guthrie is stopping by during the noon ET newscast to bring us their third-quarter earnings report.   Anadarko and BP Exploration are working together on a joint venture.  The project calls for the exploration of 95 deep-water blocks held by BP in the Central Gulf of Mexico.  On Thursday from the Houston bureau, Anadarko Petroleum Vice President of Exploration Jim Emme will stop by during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast to discuss the project.    We'll also get a preview of the Texas PUC and Legislative Oversight Committee hearing on deregulation beginning in Austin on Friday.  Legislators, energy providers and regulators will attend the hearing to decide whether deregulation should continue as planned.  We'll bring you all the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.   Finally, there's a FERC Conference on Energy Infrastructure in the West going on in Seattle, Washington on Friday.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas will be in Seattle to bring us updates on the conference throughout the day.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

 	 	    Dear Eric,  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is recommending to the President that the government open the Yucca Mountain Facility in Nevada to store the nation's high-level nuclear waste.  On Friday from the Washington bureau, we'll have reaction to Abraham's decision and where the Yucca project goes from here.     On Friday, we'll bring you more comments from our interviews with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission members William Massey and Nora Mead Brownell.  Both Commissioners will give us a look at what's in store for the FERC in the upcoming year.   The White House faces a greater number of questions after Thursday regarding Enron's collapse.  The Department of Justice announced the start of a criminal investigation and Andersen employees admitted shredding Enron documents.  We'll keep you abreast of the situation in Washington on Friday.   A federal judge's decision to move the Enron bankruptcy case is still pending.  We'll continue to bring you reaction to Enron's plight and updates on the status of the case as 500 ex-Enron employees and investors are filing suit against the former energy giant.

"YOU HAVE 48 HOURS - Message from Louise Kitchen","

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  On Tuesday and Wednesday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will be live from the Power Mart Conference in Houston.  The conference will cover key issues in electric power, gas and emerging markets.  Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt will be among those attending the conference and on Tuesday he'll join us for an interview.  Catch Levitt and live reports from the conference tomorrow.   We'll have the latest from the Washington bureau Tuesday on Regional Transmission Organizations Week at the FERC.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says we'll hear more from Chairman Pat Wood and key participants on the Commission's weeklong effort to resolve issues raised by the transition to RTOs.   On Capitol Hill Tuesday, a House subcommittee will hold a hearing on constraints in the nation's gas infrastructure, and Peter says we can expect more developments in the ongoing dispute over energy legislation in the Senate.  Watch for those stories and the latest on the anthrax scare that now includes Congress on Tuesday.   West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas talks with Henwood Energy Managing Director Gary Hunt on Tuesday during the  1:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Hunt will talk about why California should renegotiate the long-term power contracts with electricity providers, saying it would be mutually beneficial in some cases.  The state could potentially see lower prices over time, while the generators could have the opportunity to sell more capacity to the state.      A.G. Edwards Director of Futures Research Bill O'Grady will drop by during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast on Tuesday.  O'Grady will give us his reaction to the elimination of the AGA weekly numbers and explain how this change will affect traders.     We'll have more reaction to the discontinuing of the AGA numbers during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.  RDI Gas Consulting's Mike Farina will join us from Boulder on Tuesday.      Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  ENL's Washington bureau will have the latest on efforts in Congress to pass electricity legislation.  The House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee will have two hearings during the day dealing with transmission and reliability issues.  Electricity issues are also expected to be a major topic for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood as he heads to the Hill to meet with lawmakers behind closed doors.   Also from Washington, Gas Daily Editor Nathan Hodge will join us to give us his take on FERC Judge Curtis Wagner's initial decision in the El Paso/California case.  As we reported on ENL late Tuesday, Wagner concluded that the company is guilty of affiliate abuse, but says allegations the company exercised market power should be dismissed.  Catch Hodge during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.   Frost Bank Vice President Ted Harper will stop by the Houston bureau to continue the discussion on Judge Wagner's recommendation for El Paso.  And University of Houston Professor Michael Economides, Ph.D., talks about foreign oil and why it's critical for the U.S. to decrease its dependency on foreign producers.  We'll bring you these interviews from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas reports, the California Public Utilities Commission will meet on Wednesday.  The Commission could take up the CDWR's rate agreement again after failing to approve it at their last meeting.  California Governor Gray Davis is urging them to reconsider the agreement that would pave the way for the issuance of $12.5 billion in energy bonds to pay off the state's budget deficit.   Gov. Davis could make a decision on whether to delay the ban on MTBE in the state of California as early as Wednesday.   Kym says she'll bring us details as they become available.     University of Tulsa Professor Marvin Will, Ph.D., will join us from ENL Headquarters on Wednesday morning.  Will is an expert on the Middle East and tomorrow he'll discuss oil supply sensitivity in the region.  Join us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Here's the load mix for Southern and TVA, for the region and top 5, in case you haven't gotten that far yet.  Don't understand why TVA (the utility) has no res/com load, but that's what PowerDat had.  Enjoy.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  Lawmakers are getting to work on energy legislation next week.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will vote on issues involving critical energy infrastructure security.  Another Senate panel will work on a bill that would reduce carbon emissions and other harmful greenhouse gases.     Also from Washington, a House panel will take up the issue of electricity transmission policy.  We'll have updates as lawmakers work through the legislation from the Washington bureau next week.   We'll have plenty of guests from the Houston bureau starting Monday. University of Houston Professor Michael Economides, Ph.D. , will join us to discuss the economy.  Dr. Economides says energy is the key to U.S. economic stimulus, and if this point is ignored, it could cost the U.S. a million jobs per month.   The Structure Group Principal David Shepheard will join us during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast on Tuesday.  The software company is now Houston's sixth fastest-growing business due to its work in the deregulated power industry and has provided software to the ERCOT computer system.    On Friday, Tidelands Oil & Gas Corporation/Reef International President Michael Ward is penciled in at the Houston bureau.  Ward's company just received operating and construction permits from the Texas Railroad Commission to begin construction of a pipeline into Mexico.  We'll bring you all the details next week from Houston.   On Monday, the Independent Energy Producers Association begins its annual meeting.  The focus this year is on where the California market is headed.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will attend the meeting and have more on the discussion next week.    Also next week from the West Coast bureau, California Energy Commission Executive Director Steve Larson talks to Kym about the state's natural gas situation for the winter.  He'll also discuss the influx of power plant investment and the impact of the state's  long-term power contracts.     Kym says she'll also have more reaction to the U.S. District Court's approval of the Edison rescue plan, and she'll continue to watch for reaction from large creditors who are still concerned they may not be assured payment in full under the deal.   Monday from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to discuss the gas market.  Catch Fleischer during the  noon ET newscast.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.
