"eBay Auction","Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what ""suggestions"" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.  So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something different?

Hi eric, 
I just wanted to write and ask what type of foods you like to eat.  Especially breakfast foods.  I don't normally keep food in the house (and the food I do have is ancient and/or not that great - Ask Adnan!), so I wanted to know what you like so I can go grocery shopping and actually cook this weekend :-)   
Are you a simple guy, or are you a bit complex?  I only have cereal, which is what I eat daily.  But I'm sure you have different tastes. Adnan likes to have his coffee w/ a pastry on weekdays and banana pancakes w/ eggs, fruit and bacon on weekends, so I have that taken care of, but I need to know what you like.   
Another thing... We don't want you to worry about spending money on food.  You'll be well taken care of.  We won't let you go hungry.   
Anyways... hope your excited...  :-) 
Talk to you later, 
Maylynn

From: Enron Office Of The Chairman

Subject: Message from Ken Lay



Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does. 

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years. 

Ken Lay

"RE: Hi!","Hey Dude,
 
Yeah the compnay is toast.  The story gets stranger every day.  Half of the Houston office was laid off early December.  More to come I am sure.  My group was purchased by UBS Warburg.  I am fortunate that they offered me a job.  A bunch of guys in my group were not.  I feel lucky, things could be much worse for me, but instead I have an opportunity to be part of a pretty impressive organization.  Work has a actually been a little strange, since the company had declared bankruptcy we litterally have nothing to do.  Since the first week of Dec, I've been going to work for maybe a couple hours a day, just hanging out, talking to the other guys, surfin the net.  It gives me the chance to take care of all the errand type stuff I normally don't have a chance to.  I've been cooking a lot, taking care of my backyard, sellin shit on ebay, stuff like that.  Some of the other traders have been reading trading books and stuff, but you know me...  By the way my permanent home email is now esaibi@houston.rr.com <mailto:esaibi@houston.rr.com>.
 
I got your card that you sent to Adnan.  Thanks.  I'm not sure if I told you, but I bought a house here a few months back.  When my Dad was planning to move here I thought it would be better to buy a place instead of renting a big apt.  It's brand new, location is pretty good in that it is near a lot of things.  Although the area right around here is a bit sketchy.  I figure it'll probably get better over time.  I hope things are going well for you.  When will you visit the U.S?  If you ever visit LA let me know.  I could always meet you there if you give me enough notice.  As you can imagine, airline tickets are pretty cheap these days.
 
Can you believe Khan is married?  It was kinda strange cuz I was pretty much the only one of his friends involved in the wedding.  His brother and family were able to show up for the ceremony at least.  That was good.  It was a bit difficult because my Dad passed away the morning of his wedding, but I knew I couldn't leave him then.  Khan has some pictures if he hasn't shown you any yet.  He sent me a couple.  Well I gotta go to bed soon.  I'll do a better job keeping in touch.  It's just been a little difficult lately, I'm sure you understand.  Don't work too hard.

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

"","Hey there,

Hope everything is going well.  I have some bad news.  In case you have not heard, my Dad passed on a week ago Sunday.  I was in LA for Adnan's wedding when my brother called.  Drove up to SF Sunday night, funeral was Monday afternoon.  I stayed in SF for a couple days, but there wasn't much I needed to do.  My brother is and will be taking care of paperwork and my Dad's apt and stuff like that.  So I drove back down to LA and stayed there for a couple days before returning to Houston.

Life at Enron is pretty down these days.  I am very fortunate to still be employed.  As you prob know of the Houston employees were cut loose last Monday.  On Friday they swiped about half of ENA.  It was a bit of a shocker.  I thought layoffs would be minimal around this group.  Origination is almost non existant now.  Some good people I worked with or out.  Since I wasn't here Friday, I was really nervous coming in.  But I think it's ok for now.

They are in negotiations with a few banks to buy the floor, or what is left of it.  They'll probably form a new patnership with a new name and everything.  Honestly, I think that is llikely to happen.  It's just a question of what will be left by the time that all happens.

I see on my streamer that CPN is down to 18 1/4.  Ouch.  Morgan Stanley downgraded the whole sector, what a bunch of geniuses.  Let's just hope for the best.

Ok then drop me a line when you have a chance.  My home address is esaibi@houston.rr.com in case Enron bites the dust.  Later

Eric

"Off Peak Length for Monday","I sold the 10 MW off peak to STEC.  Enpower 796442.  I thought the length was in the Asset book, but it appeared that the lenth was in the Ercot Mngmnt book.  So I put the sale in that book to keep everyone flat.  I did not make any other changes to Enpower.

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.
