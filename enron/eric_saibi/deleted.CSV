"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Eric,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   Just a reminder - On Friday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante is live in Cairo, Egypt covering the OPEC meeting.  Join us tomorrow as Kim brings us the latest on possible oil production cuts beginning in January.      We'll also have more reaction from here in Washington to the OPEC meeting.  American Petroleum Institute Chief Economist John Felmy, Ph.D., will share his thoughts on the cartel's moves and what they might mean for the U.S.  Also during the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast, The Petroleum Finance Company Senior Market Analyst George Beranek will give us his assessment of the market if OPEC follows through with a production cut.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has had a very busy year - from the California crisis to the crisis at Enron, the Commission has had a full docket.  On Friday during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast, we'll hear what former FERC Chairman James Hoecker thinks about the past year at the FERC and what issues may surface during the New Year.   As the year draws to a close, the Houston bureau will take a look back at one of the biggest energy stories - the collapse of the energy giant, Enron.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says on Friday, the Houston bureau will review the timetable of Enron's demise, the effects of its bankruptcy filing, layoffs and the company's downgraded credit rating.    As Texas deregulation nears, competition in the market is heating up among retail energy providers.  The Houston bureau says the Texas Public Utility Commission set the price to beat for areas in the state, and competing retail energy providers are beating those prices.  We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says on Friday, California Senator Debra Bowen talks about what to expect from the legislature in the first few weeks of 2002.  Kym says possible topics of discussion include the issuance of the state's $12.5 billion in energy bonds, the California Power Authority and plans to get Southern California Edison and PG?out of debt.   Also on Friday from the West Coast bureau, California Energy Commissioner Michael Moore talks about the gas supplies in California.  Join us for these reports and more from Sacramento tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Thursday, Dec. 27, 2001    Crude: $20.90/bbl -$0.37   Unleaded: $0.5927/gallon -$0.0086   Heating Oil: $0.5815/gallon -$0.0131   Gas: $2.555/mmBtu -$0.356   Broadcasting Note: On New Year's Eve, we're broadcasting through 1:00 p.m. ET.  We're dark on New Year's Day.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.
