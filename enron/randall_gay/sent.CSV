Subject:	Important Notes for Move to New Building


PLEASE READ:

There is only 1 week left before moving into the new building.  There are two shredco containers located at EB3206E and in the freight elevator for documents that need shredding.  Also there will be a couple of large trash containers located on the 32nd floor today 11/2/01 and next Friday 11/9/01.   Please start the cleanup process. 

Remember:

1.  You can only move 6 boxes per person plus equipment
2.  Take home all IPAQ'S, Blackberry's, Palm Pilots and Laptops Friday 11/9/01 so that nothing is misplaced
3.  If you have a cellular phone charger on your desk....don't forget to pack 
4.  Clean out all Voicemails by 5:00 PM on Friday 11/9/01
5.  The new Enron Building will be closed to all until 5:00 AM on Monday Morning.  If you try to come up here, you will not be allowed in the     	building.
6.  Please give your User ID and Password to your assistant so she/he can make sure that everything is up and running for you on Monday 	morning.
7.  If you have a headset, please pack it.   They will not be installed until Monday morning.
8.  Since there are no amtels moving, please be sure you have MSN messenger installed in your computer because this is what your assistant 	will use to give you your 
     messages. If you do not have it, your assistant can help you install it.
9.  Please label your PC, Boxes (on the ends), and cradles, scanners, etc.  You will have a new mouse and keyboard in the new building and your 	monitors will have speakers on them so you don't have

"RE: ECS Sale","Stephanie:  scott never called back yesterday, after repeated calls.  I called him a few minutes ago, and he wanted his lawyers to talk to Gerald, before they make a deal.  So at least the ball is starting to roll.  Will let you know what happens.  Thanks

Subject:	Fwd: We're Home
[Gay, Randall L.]  Brian, Tracy, Sarah and Jack:  i am so happy for all of you.  i'm glad everyone made it home safely and is in good health.
I got the note from your dad, and knew ya'll had left.  Our prayers were with you on your trip.    [Gay, Randall L.]  Sounds like you had a hectic time getting ready, as always.  Im glad the trip seems to have worked out well.  Would like to hear all about it sometime when you have some time. 
[Gay, Randall L.]  
I do apolegize for not getting back to you sooner.  Things have been very strange and busy here.  By now im sure you have heard about the dizzying collapse of Enron.  As of right now i am still employed, but bankruptcy is probably on Monday.  Luckily, the trading floor will probably be sold to an investment bank, so we may continue just as before.  Will have to see how it works out.

And of course, Thanksgiving was a very busy time, visiting family and such.  Katy is doing wonderful.  She likes school, and wants a dirt bike and a pony for Christmas.

I really am happy for ya'll, and hope to see pictures of Jack soon.  Im sure Kathleen is smiling down on ya'll.  Take care and hope to hear from you soon (at least sooner than i get back to you).  

Randy and Katy

Randy,  Attached is a screen print from the Sitara audit report.  Are you the ""rgay"" who changed this price from $2.22 to $2.20 on deal 1021469?  I'm working on the Reliant Energy Services netout for September production and I'm getting a credit for them on this deal because of this price change.  Can you tell if it's valid?  If it is, I'll give them the credit.  If it's not, can you change the price back so this credit will go away?
