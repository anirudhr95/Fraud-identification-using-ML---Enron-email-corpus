As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future.

"RE: TWPL Imbalance","Stephanie,
 
Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day).
 
I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon.
 
I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January.
 
I am confident that things will run smoother in the future.
 
Regards,
 
Paul

Greetings Paul:
 
Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal. 
 
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
 
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
 
Please advise ASAP.

"New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

"FUNDIES MEETING EVERY DAY BEGINNING NEXT WEEK","For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

"Citizens Griffith cut procedures","Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.  Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.

Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.

Thanks,

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

Subject:	FW: Logistics Commercial Realignment



After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

 	 	    Dear Randy,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   Just a reminder - On Friday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante is live in Cairo, Egypt covering the OPEC meeting.  Join us tomorrow as Kim brings us the latest on possible oil production cuts beginning in January.      We'll also have more reaction from here in Washington to the OPEC meeting.  American Petroleum Institute Chief Economist John Felmy, Ph.D., will share his thoughts on the cartel's moves and what they might mean for the U.S.  Also during the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast, The Petroleum Finance Company Senior Market Analyst George Beranek will give us his assessment of the market if OPEC follows through with a production cut.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has had a very busy year - from the California crisis to the crisis at Enron, the Commission has had a full docket.  On Friday during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast, we'll hear what former FERC Chairman James Hoecker thinks about the past year at the FERC and what issues may surface during the New Year.   As the year draws to a close, the Houston bureau will take a look back at one of the biggest energy stories - the collapse of the energy giant, Enron.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says on Friday, the Houston bureau will review the timetable of Enron's demise, the effects of its bankruptcy filing, layoffs and the company's downgraded credit rating.    As Texas deregulation nears, competition in the market is heating up among retail energy providers.  The Houston bureau says the Texas Public Utility Commission set the price to beat for areas in the state, and competing retail energy providers are beating those prices.  We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says on Friday, California Senator Debra Bowen talks about what to expect from the legislature in the first few weeks of 2002.  Kym says possible topics of discussion include the issuance of the state's $12.5 billion in energy bonds, the California Power Authority and plans to get Southern California Edison and PG?out of debt.   Also on Friday from the West Coast bureau, California Energy Commissioner Michael Moore talks about the gas supplies in California.  Join us for these reports and more from Sacramento tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Thursday, Dec. 27, 2001    Crude: $20.90/bbl -$0.37   Unleaded: $0.5927/gallon -$0.0086   Heating Oil: $0.5815/gallon -$0.0131   Gas: $2.555/mmBtu -$0.356   Broadcasting Note: On New Year's Eve, we're broadcasting through 1:00 p.m. ET.  We're dark on New Year's Day.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

 	 	    Dear Randy,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   In Washington, we'll continue to examine the major energy issues expected to arise during the New Year.  We'll take a look at what Congress will do with comprehensive energy and electricity legislation.  Our Washington bureau will also follow the FERC and its push for regional transmission organizations and wholesale competition.   These are some of the issues we'll look at as 2002 begins.

He'll give us his take on the U.S. relationship with OPEC and we'll get his assessment on the start of retail competition in Texas.  Gee will join us during the noon ET newscast on Wednesday.   The big switch is coming to Houston - On Wednesday we'll bring you a report on deregulation starting in Texas on January 1.  The Houston bureau will have details on how the power grid reacted to the switch, and get an update from retail electricity providers.     Also from Houston, John S. Herold, Inc.

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

"P&L estimates","Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Randy,  Solar and wind power have long been used as renewable sources of energy.  On Wednesday, we'll have a report on an interesting alternative to these renewables.  ENL's Gale Smith will tell us about a Louisiana company that is using rice hulls to produce electricity.  Catch Gale's report from Houston tomorrow.   The Enron/Dynegy negotiations continue and Gale tells me the Houston bureau is keeping close tabs on all developments.   Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' David Hitchcock will talk to ENL's Kym McNicholas Wednesday about California's current credit rating.  The state is set to issue a proposed $12.5 billion in revenue bonds and Hitchcock will discuss whether renegotiating California's long-term power contracts could delay the process.     Kym will also speak with the Executive Director of the California Natural Gas Producers Association John Martini.  He'll address the unspecified threats to U.S. pipelines.  Watch for those details from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday.   We'll have an interview from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.  Alaron Trading Vice President Phil Flynn will join us to discuss the API and DOE numbers and tell us what's going on with the brewing OPEC price war.  We'll hear from Flynn during the noon ET newscast tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Nov. 27, 2001    Crude: $19.48 +$0.79   Unleaded: $0.5381 +$0.0164   Heating Oil: $0.5394 +$0.0177   Natural Gas: $2.606 -$0.09   We'll have live coverage from Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"Dec 01 and Jan 02 Gas Nominations for ECS with TW","

I've located the Gas Nomination information that was prepared for Dec. 01 and updated to include Jan. 02 business.
The Dec.01 numbers differ slightly from the initial numbers generated by James Centilli at TW as well as the numbers
that Stephanie Miller conveyed in her Dec. 18th memo.  

These values are based on the nomination worksheets & actual power bills from he respective utilities.
