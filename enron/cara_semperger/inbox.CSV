"Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?","Wednesday February 6, 1:41 pm Eastern Time 
BusinessWeek Online
DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS 
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas 
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. 
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. 
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. 
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. 
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. 
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. 
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. 
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' 
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' 
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

"hello stranger","Hello.  How's life?  Mine is pretty good.  I have a face to face interview with Merch Pharmaceuticals.  I guess I did ok on the phone interview even though I didn't think they'd call me back. 

Question for you.  I was wondering if you could change the first sentence in my letter of recommendation because it talks about FMLA leave and the dates I worked at Enron, which I have on my resume, but I'd rather they didn't know that I have a little one because I don't want them to judge me by that.. or think I'll be a slacker because I won't, and I already have the same babysitter set up and ready to go.  (if I get lucky and get the job)...  :)  I could come by one afternoon this week to pick it up because my interview is Tuesday.  What do you think?  No big deal if not, just thought I'd try.   

Also, I'm taking Emily to Gymboree (a baby class) and Chris Calgar's(spelling???) wife and son are in it.  I just met her Tuesday for the first time.  I guess they are moving to Houston the end of March. 

Hope all is well and maybe we'll see you soon.  Emily is such a chunk now.

Here's what we have been waiting for.  Its the sector voting registration
site.  You'll need a browser with 128 bit encryption to get in (guess I'll
have to go home to do that).

So go tell everyone you know who qualifies for one of the these sectors to
register.

John Canavan from Montana Power has put forth his name to be considered for
the ESC Vice Chair officer position.

Remember, in order to vote for the officers at the Denver/April ESC meeting
you need to be there and be registered.

"Access Card Information","Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).
