ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

Thanks.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

"RE: Outstanding Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation","Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Pre-Schedule Workspace and Path Confirmation Report.

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Generating Transmission confirmation records appears not to be working for second or third transmissions. The record makes a transmission line for the transmission provider, but does not insert the Trans2 name or Trans2 oasis data into the path. 
It appears that saving does not always work.
Getting ""list index out of bounds"" errors when attempting to run the Build Route.
QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.
Add (if possible)  error checking for missing Supply or Market deal numbers, Why would this not be possible?  So much is driven by the deal number that to omit it would be a problem.   and missing Physical or Non-Physical Designation.  If nothing is specified in the Phys? column, Non-Physical will be assume.
Questoin:  So far we have done nothing for the Daily Summary.  Is this something that can wait, or do we need to get it done for this release? Daily summary is a current function; creating data that I use to report our volumes to our traders, Belden, and Lavorato. This must be done for production, as they ask me for this often. 
Yesterday, I found another problem, If I re-type a hour range in the sched hour cell in PSW, it converts it to date format, and I get an ""invalid variant type conversion"" error.  Nothing I did short of deleting the cells, making the changes in MS Excel and re-pasting them worked.

Path Confirmation Report:
Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. 
Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be an error-checking point? 
Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   
Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserved from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling. 
Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Transmission should be optional
Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. 
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. 
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a ""Go to Cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will

Closing the path cut is fast now

A couple of other things...

When double click a cell automatically go to the ""Editor"" edit box.
Allow show / hide of Editor.  Add to menu under View / Toolbars as well as popup menu.
Move copy from Workspace to File in the menu.
Add an icon for copy.  I believe there is an action list and image list you can use.
Rename ""Excel Utilities"" to ""Spreadsheet Utilities"" on the toolbar as well as the View menu.

Also please implement the Summary for ""WEEK"" following the rules from your previous email.

"RE: Bus Passes and Parking for UBS","Bus passes are available for the month of February so let me know if you want a bus pass.  As noted in previous emails from Julie, parking will be paid by Enron up to $89 per month for each employee, and employees make their own parking arrangements.  It's my understanding parking will be paid (reimbursed) for the month of February up to $89.  However, I think the WTC parking may be handled differently.  Please see Julie if you park in WTC since I am not in that loop.  Going forward beyond February, I am not sure if UBS Warburg will pay for parking/bus/Tri-Met, but I will let you know if I hear something.

"RE: One more piece of the puzzle to help me test","Cara,

Sorry, I have to retract the previous email.  I just noticed a problem with the data for the 16th.  Hopefully I will have it resolved shortly.

Subject:	RE: One more piece of the puzzle to help me test

The problem continues,  I could pull up the schedules in Scheduling, but they are all routed, so I rescheduled the entire day of June 15, which is the day I will test, and when I did,  I queried scheduling for the 15th, and when the schedules came up they show no mw's but do show a route, but only for the 16th.

I don't know why that is happening. I am trying to get my sheet re-set up for the 16th of june, to try all over again.

Can you see if you all can get me clean unrouted Palo Verde data for June 16th???

I cannot get RT position manager to run in TestP,  which will show me the total of MWH that are unrouted.

I get this error message when I try.

"Testing Preschedule workspace","Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet the new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R.  


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On- June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped, and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (West Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longer than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept starting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encouraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with what I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran through its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing.

Thanks

"UBS Wins","John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner.  As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...

"January 28th mtg in DC on","Re the Jan 28th NERC/NAESB mtg in DC:

Background:
NERC is in discussions with the North American Energy Standards Board
(NAESB, formerly GISB) and others on any needed changes to either NAESB or
WESM for determining how standards should be established for the Wholesale
Electric quadrant of the NAESB organization.  Future mtg dates are:
Feb 1 in NYC
Feb 12 in Atlanta
Feb 21 in the West, maybe Phoenix (per request by Dennis, at BPA/Western
Canada, etc. urging)
There is also a plan to provide telephone or electronic conferencing options
at these meetings.  I plan to participate by conference Feb 1 and 12, and by
attendance Feb 21st.

Some of the issues discussed at the Jan 28th mtg are:

1) relationship between the NAESB Board and the WESM Board
2) appropriate industry membership segments
3) relationship with FERC/Canada/State Commissions/RTOs
4) funding
5) standards development process and compliance 

There appears to be industry consensus on use of NAESB as the umbrella
organization for the electric/gas wholesale and retail quadrants and
somewhat less agreement on use of a modified NERC for the electric wholesale
quadrant.  Some still argue that NERC should only focus on reliability and
shouldn't set business/commercial practices, however many in the industry
understand that these are inextricably linked and there should be a single
organization for setting both reliability and business/commercial
practices/standards.
 
NAESB quadrants may use the NAESB prescribed/pre-approved ANSI process and
governance/membership criteria- which differ slightly from the new NERC
Organization Standards Process and WESM criteria - or may choose different
criteria and a different ANSI-approved process.  More info on NAESB can be
found at www.naesb.org . 

The FERC Order Providing Guidance on the Formation of a Standards
Development Organization for the Wholesale Electric Industry (RM01-12-000,
dated  12/19/01) requests the industry to ""agree on a single standards
organization to develop wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002"".
The NERC BOT will take action on the revised WESM at their February mtg.

"RE: A couple a questions","Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)

Subject: Good Morning, my love 


Good Morning Honey, 

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything. 

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

I love you, 

Cara

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path Confirmation done on 8/23

Good Evening,

I wanted to poke around a bit and see if I could find anything quickly so you all could proceed.

Path Confirmation:

I like the new way the confirm box pops up.  

Path Cut,

I tried to cut a path for 6/21, got through all the usual screens, and added my info,  I got the following error:

""Cannot be updated. Key Violation. ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_SCHD_PATH_CUTS) violated""  no cut information was saved.


I still cannot get anything to show up in scheduling.  I tried West Wing for 6/21,  PV for 6/22, and Mid C for 6/23. The software says it is loading deals, but no results are showing in the filter or the schedule screen.
I have to be able to really test the routing, so  we need to get this resolved.  Most of the routing looked ok, except the deals changed in scheduling would not route and the Physical vs Non-physical flag was not being triggered properly. Because our physical and non-physical volumes are tracked through Enpower and recorded for the WSCC and NERC fees that we pay, this information needs to be correct.


I will stay late, come in early, or whatever it takes to get things tested.  


Thanks,

Cara

Hi Kim

Thanks for getting SCEM changed to MIRANT.  They started showing up right this morning.

How difficult is it to get them changed, and who all is affected by it?  I have a laundry list of codes that are cumbersome or confusing, and would like to see about changing a batch of them.  I will do all the leg work of finding out if certain ones are ok with everyone, but wanted your input and advice.

Thanks,

"RE: PSW/PSC 0910 Test","Corry,

	As per Will, the understanding was that deals with transmissions were far and few in between and were currently being manually routed, and this was not a feature to be expected with the current version of Preschedule Workspace and so it will not route currently.

	Issue with Deal Scheduling not showing the correct 'physical route' status has been addressed and is currently being worked on and will be released within the next day or two. The ""Edit Strip Information"" bug has been forwarded also.
	
	Able to recreate the 'Edit' bug and fixed, a new version will roll out by afternoon containing the fix. 

	In regards to the West paths showing up when EAST criteria was selected, this issue was found out to be related to a database modification that was made to include the REGION code to all transactions. Creating the REGION field, NON-NULLABLE requirement, in the database required a default value to be inserted and 'EAST' was chosen; hence transactions which were for the WEST desk without an initial region fell into this particular problem.  The erroneous data within the PATH SCHEDULE CONFIRMATIONS has been deleted and all new confirmed paths will now correctly be displayed since our applications correctly state the REGION information associated with each USER.

	I will update everyone upon a new version of Preschedule Workspace being moved to Stage

thanks

Subject:	PSW/PSC 0910 Test

Will,
I found about the same issues we had already discussed while running the PSW/PSC.

I ran the sheet for 6/19 since there were no ""West"" paths in the confirmations (I still see the West paths when ""View: East Trading Desk"" is checked).

Most of the paths ""routed"" in Deal Scheduling except for a deal that contained transmission with the correct Enpower number provided (Error: Capability not supported: Cannot route transmission deals)
The ""Routing Detail"" in Deal Scheduling did not contain a check mark for ""Physical Route"" on any of the physical paths.
Also, in scheduling, the ""Edit Strip Information"" does not contain the Path or comments in the Deal Scheduling Comments section as before.

The physical path that did not route in scheduling also did not go the the Path Confirmations.


Also, I found that when I chose ""Edit"" on the Pre-Schedule Workspace, it created a New Workspace.  It also occurred twice when the mouse cursor passed by the word ""edit"" without physically clicking on it.

That's about it for today,
Corry

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football


 
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides.""

Subject:	RE: One more piece of the puzzle to help me test

The problem continues,  I could pull up the schedules in Scheduling, but they are all routed, so I rescheduled the entire day of June 15, which is the day I will test, and when I did,  I queried scheduling for the 15th, and when the schedules came up they show no mw's but do show a route, but only for the 16th.

I don't know why that is happening. I am trying to get my sheet re-set up for the 16th of june, to try all over again.

Can you see if you all can get me clean unrouted Palo Verde data for June 16th???

I cannot get RT position manager to run in TestP,  which will show me the total of MWH that are unrouted.

I get this error message when I try.

"Test of very tiny Preschedule sheet","I made a new sheet for the 18th of june, only 7 lines long.  routing took only  a few seconds. I changed all the counterparty names to match the Enpower extract

I don't have an accurate time, but the confirm seemed to take about 10-15 minutes to run., all ran and have an OK now in the J and N columns.

I am still unable to verify that anything is actually housed in confirmation.

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

CF

Someone sent this to me, it seemed appropriate!

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football


 
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides.""

"RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation","Cara,

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility)
Date
Path
Cuts

Is the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Good Afternoon,

Here are my findings for the latest Release of the PSW and Path Conf. I am re-running the date of June 22, as I see no data in the path confirmation for that date.

PreSchedule Workspace:

I tried to open the sheet ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  and got this error ""Access violation at address 00000016. Read of address 00000016.  I could not save, close or do anything, I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW.  I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet, and had closed the COB sheet. When I re-opened the ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  sheet, it was completely blank.  This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet. 

Error checking
The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal (#657854.1) that was put in the market deal number area. It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buy/resale.  This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present, but the routing error check mentioned it in rows 69-192, where the deal number was not present. Can the sheet be made to understand that a buy/resale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell?

I also got just ""Error:"" with no explanation of what the error was for rows 3-6, 9-11 and 21-28.  Rows 3-6  and 9-11, has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream, both identified as Portland General System on the sheet. Rows 21-28 I see no errors apparent. 

My second PV sheet gave me  routing error  ""Error:""  with no explanation on rows 2-45.  The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export.  I changed all rows to X, and still got the routing error with no explanation.  I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection. Could it be that the system already detects routes?

 << File: PV_JUNE22_LIMITED.psc >> 



Path Confirmation:

The Transmission information seems to be populating correctly, all trans looks good and has the -E- on each side. I can put my POR/POD info in the Oasis cell, and all the info looks great!
The Global ID Sorting is working just right.
The Tag Sorting is also working just right.
The expanded view is showing the entire path regardless of length.
I like the POR and POD sort capability, this will be very helpful.

In the Expanded View,  even though I know the counterparty, this view sometimes shows me a blank drop down box where the counterparty should be. Allegheney did not show a counterparty name here. This actually looks like it might be specific to Allegheney.

In the line view My counterparty on the sheet CPS shows Constellation Power Source, Inc.  but in the expanded view I see City Public Service of San Antonio. They both have CPS as their short name, but the second counterparty is an East Desk Counterparty. Corry, Can you get their short name changed to something else you like?

Path Cut:

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for.  I only want to see the following:  California   Northwest   WSCC-N   WSCC-S  Rockies.  If I need to provide more explanation on this, I am happy to do so. The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete, and will be cumbersome for real-time and settlements to use.  These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done.

Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done, just over a minute. Users will percieve this as something broken.

I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut, I will hand this off to them very soon.  



Overall Findings:

I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production.  We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue, but the functionality looks really good.  My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from ""X"" date previous the records are in lotus, and from ""X"" date forward they are in the new system. Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both.

Please let me know anything else that I need to do, and when I may test again.  Thanks

"Outstanding Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation","What follows are known issues with the Pre-Schedule Workspace and Path Confirmation Report.

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Generating Transmission confirmation records appears not to be working for second or third transmissions.
It appears that saving does not always work.
Getting ""list index out of bounds"" errors when attempting to run the Build Route.
QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.
Add (if possible) error checking for missing Supply or Market deal numbers, and missing Physical or Non-Physical Designation.  If nothing is specified in the Phys? column, Non-Physical will be assume.
Questoin:  So far we have done nothing for the Daily Summary.  Is this something that can wait, or do we need to get it done for this release?

Path Confirmation Report:
Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data.
Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area?
Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up.
Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related.
Extend the size limit of the path.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Transmission should be optional
Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail?


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will

I ran the PSW for the East (6/22 data)  and also had problems with each of the following:
1)	Enter moves cell to the left
2) 	Colors changed
3)	Path with transmission did not go to confirmation sheet
4) 	Physicals were noted on the confirmation strips, but not on scheduling strips
5)	Confirmation strips were deleted, and new data added to the PSW.  Then, the confirmation button would not respond again.
6)	The first query for buildroute did not work.  Second query worked ok, data could be viewed.

What did work:

Only East power showing up!

I'll be testing again today, and D. Baugham will be looking at the PSC this week.

Subject:	Testing the PSW

Good Evening,

We had agreed to just do a test to see what issues were still outstanding in the PSW and Path Confirmation.

I re-ran all the data for June 22 in the West, here are my findings:


Some little things seem to have changed, I am not sure why they changed

PreSchedule Workspace - Pressing the Enter key makes the cursor go to the cell to the left, and no other way.  Enter+Shift moves the cursor to the right.  This function is different, the Enter key used to function much like it did in Excel, and I am not sure why this change has been made.

Path confrimation - The color Pallette is very different, and inferior. Did that get changed? Any color not on the main pallette is now grainy and difficult to read the path thru.
 also, the color on the path is the chosen color, but several fields show as dark grey no matter what color is chosen.  There also seems to be no pattern to why some cells are grey and some aren't.

The window for the error report now snaps up very small. It was defaulting to the same size as the PSW. This seems different and inferior.


Functionality bug still to be fixed:

I routed all of the deals for all the western points, and a spot check still shows that the Physical flag is not showing up properly in Deal Scheduling, although it does show properly in Path Confirmation. I checked many routed deals, not one showed the Physical flag checked.

Pending features that I am not sure of the status on:

The Real Time discussion that is currently part of Lotus, but spoke with Poston regarding and I believe he is heading up this effort with you all.

The Executive report that will replace the AGGSchedVol report and the Daily Excel Summary.

In summary:

All other functions seem to be working, and as soon as we nail down the routing one, I can pass the testing off to real time for their final changes before going to production.
It is my intention that once we go to production we have one entire month of parallell testing before the Lotus system is abandoned.

Thanks for your work, let me know when you are ready for me to test again.  I would like to re-test June 22 again if possible.

Thanks,

Cara

"RE: Further Testing of PSW","Cara,

	Not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you log in against PWRPRODN, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe.. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summary detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros and such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.. do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy to help.

Hi Asem;


O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls
This is the right address.  I am reluctant to add data to the production model, as it will mess up my reports.  I might rename a test file with a strange date, and then purge it.

That should work, eh?

Cara,

	Reason for the error is that the file it was looking for was titled PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTTestP.xls . Ive gone ahead and made changes to the application to read the file named as such. Since we're talking about locations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfortunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself.

Work is pretty boring today. I am trying to make a flow chart for the very first time. I'm using Visio to create the chart so it will take me some extra time because I don't know what I'm doing. 

I am so tired. I think it's because I haven't had any sugar in two days. Hopefully I will start to get used to this soon. I know it is going to be well worth the effort in the long run. I love you so much. Thank you for helping me get healthy. You are a wonderful person and I am so lucky to have you in my life. :)

"RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation for Target date 6/20","Cara et all, 

	Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: 

	New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..


PreSchedule Workspace:
#1
Problem:
Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Solution:
Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value.


#2
Problem:
Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix

Solution:
Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open

#3
Problem:
Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Solution:
Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report.

#4
Problem:
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Solution:
Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any.



Path Confirmation:


#1
Problem:
One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

Solution:
Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned.

Routing
Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12 the time is fine.

**needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.


Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20

 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >>  << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  << File: Palo_June20.psc >>  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Thanks,

Cara

I tried opening your file and experienced some problems as well.  I will figure out what is causing the problem and hopefully have something for you to play with first thing tomorrow.  I may have to go ahead an make the changes required to fix the saving/loading that I described in my previous email.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Subject:	Testing Preschedule Workspace

Good Afternoon,

I have been unable to sucessfully test the Preschedule workspace, here are the problems I have run up against:

In the special Terminal server that Will sent me,  I was unable to copy from Excel and paste into the app

In the local system, I was able to copy from Excel and Paste into the app, but it would not allow me to save any data.  The app saved itself as a file, but none of my data were preserved in it. Here is the saved app file that was created.

 << File: MAY_O2_PV.psc >> 

Both locally and in Terminal server, I was unable to close the app.  I had to use the task manager and end task to get me out of the Preschedule workspace viewer.  I did get numerous dialog boxes with various errors, but did not log them all. I can do that if you wish.

I have a set of data re-designed to match the columns of the app, here is the data for May 2.  This will be the approximate size of the sheet if monthly deals are required to be included.

 << File: may2pvhlhdata.xls >> 
Please let me know what I can do to begin testing again,  I am very anxious to get started.

Cara

"New West Power Deal Info","Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

Subject:	RE: Outstanding Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation

Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report.

Path Confirmation Report:
Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Fixed Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Fixed  Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. 
Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be an error-checking point? 
Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   
Fixed Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserved from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling. 
Fixed, Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Fixed  For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Fixed Transmission should be optional (Confirm with Cara)
Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Added Copy Path Cut Button, it stores all selected path_cut ino, change the required hour and save it.   Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. 
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. 
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a ""Go to Cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will

We thought we would clarify the Parking & Mass Transit options:

1) Three options are available:

2WTC/Outside parking lots
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month

Tri-Met
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.

Daily Validations
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.

2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.

3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Subject:	Parking & Mass Transit Resolution

We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

Good Morning,

I will create another test day to look at all these changes, my target date is June 21.  

I will need routing records removed from the following points for that day:

MidColumbia
COB N/S
Portland General System
BPA Busbar
Palo Verde
Midway-PSC
Mead-230
Four Corners
West Wing

Please let me know when these routes are cleared and I will start re-populating data.  It will take me an hour or so to create the new spreadsheets for that day.

Thanks,

Subject:	Updates to Pre-Schedule Workspace and Path Confirmation

Cara / Corry,

I have released into stage new versions of PreSchedule and Path Confirmation.  Included in the new release are...

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Fix to ""Variant Conversion"" errors.
Now able to print Error Log.
Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data.
Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.  
The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM
Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over.
The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records.
""Copy Workspace"" functionality.
Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color).
Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do.
Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation.
Fix ""General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem.
'Get  Now' when repeatedly pressed does not cause application to be unstable

Path Confirmation:
?	Added preferences for storing and setting the display colors in the grid
?	""Invalid BLOB handle in record buffer "" error is fixed
?	Enpower counterparty long names are shown 
?	Improved loading time while opening path confirmation dialog
?	Provided an option confirm the paths in batches,  
?	Path cut check box indicator is fixed

I hope you slept well last night. I sure am happy that I got to be with you again last night. I missed you soooo much over the weekend.

I think we will be very happy together for a long time. :-) 
Do you want to go see a movie tonight? I was thinking about seeing ""The Mothman Prophecies"" at 4:35. How does that sound to you. Or we can just kick back and relax at home. I'm good either way.

I have been told today that these folks will have to do all of our scheduling as of Monday, they are being trained today but will have to have working logins patterned after Donald Robinson by the end of business today.

Serena Bishop ( I do not know what she has access to, she was the California scheduler)

If this cannot be done, please call Murray O'Neil asap.  His Cell is 503-702-9846

"RE: Test Results for June 23rd","Cara,

There is a bug in Path confirm that which will not allow you to select the Trading Region/Desk.  Vish is working on a fix and there should be a new version available in about thirty minutes.  I have checked, and your files are there; it's just that Path Confirm is always showing East.

Regards,
Will

Subject:	Test Results for June 23rd 

Good Afternoon

I ran only the Mid Columbia Sheet data for June 23rd.  Here are my findings:

PreSchedule Workspace:

I was forced to choose East or West:  good.

The error-check feature found the following problems:
	Incorrectly spelled Counterparty short names
	Missing Sched term 
	Missing Border 1 
	Missing Sched Hour 
	Missing Supply or Market Price
	Missing Supply or Market  Cont. Term
	Missing Time Zone
	Missing Supply  or Market MW


Error Check did not see the following errors:
	Missing Supply OR Market deal numbers
	Missing Physical or Non-Physical designation

During my work, I exited once and decided not to save changes in my MidC sheet.  When i re-opened, there was no data on the sheet at all. I re-pasted my sheet data in, but when I tried to execute the build-route query, I got an error message saying ""List index out of bounds (2)"". When I resaved my data, closed and re-opened, my data was there, but when I tried to query build route again, I got the error message ""List index out of bounds (3)"". 

The confirm seemed to run very quickly, but I found no data populated in the June 23rd date of Path confirmation.

Routing took 13 minutes to run, acceptable speed for the amount of paths (all daily and all monthly for MidC). QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.


Path Confirmation:

Not forced to choose East or West on this:

Unable to test this with the new data as none was displayed.  I will test as soon as I get word that I can.

Please let me know what you find, here is the sheet that I ran.

Subject:	Pre-Schedule WS and Path Confirmation

Corry, Cara,

There are new versions have been released to stage.

What's new and what's fixed:

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Now able to select a Trading Region/Desk (EAST or WEST) to separate path confirm records.
Confirm record creation should be significantly faster.  Let me know if the speed is still unacceptable.
Issues with Aliases should be fixed.  (This covers your problem, Corry).
Now able to Check for confirm errors without saving to confirm report.

Path Confirmation
?	Fixed - Provide an option to delete bogus confirmation records
?	Added radio button - Cut Type Code. is vague, I think we need a button here.  Now we have a forced choice button of Hour-Ahead or Real-Time which works well.
?	Fixed  - Scheduled path quantity is vague, this should be Cut Volume.
?	By default it shows the original path now, New Path Text - If we make the New Path cut part of the Expanded view of the original path, then we could show Original Path, New path, and the user could copy  and make small changes to the new path instead of typing the whole thing in.
?	Follows Deal Entry Standards - The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
?	Fixed - The Annuity field currently does not recognize any number. It also should be able to function with NO number in it, as a typical resupply will not need an annuity. 	
?	Resupply Deal # - This also needs a choice. It will either be a New supply or a New Sink. This should need a deal number to proceed. Right now it does not like the deal number plus decimal.  I think to be consistent we need to require it everywhere a deal number is required
?	Fixed - Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.


Regards,
Will

"RE: PreSchedule Workspace Testing","Cara,

I apologize for not sending out an email last week; I have been busy with the Consolidated Position Manager.  I did release new versions of both Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation.

According to Asem the new version of PreSchedule:
Dumps summary report to excel
Edit box shown for looking at cells with large values

	Outstanding issues:
What to do with records with  'WEEK' specified in SCHED_TERM field for there is no 'WEEK' section in the physicalandbookoutsummary excel report file.  I have fired off an email to Cara asking for assistance on this matter. - determined that should be treated as daily

	Notes:
The application will look in the follow places for the PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54.xls file if user launching app has no existing profile in pwr_user_default_settings (fSUMMARYLOCATION) 
		i.e. User is WEST trader and in following DB environments:
			pwrstage[n/p]:	M:\Electric\Schedule\Process\WEST\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54WestTest.xls
			pwrprod:	O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54WestProd.xls
A pre-existing excel report must exist in location for appending to occur



According to Vish the new version of Path Confirmation:
	Path Confirmations Report
Fixed, Press Enter or Select the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Log Text displays in clean format
POR/POD can be easy to pick up


	Path Cuts
Fixed  Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Fixed Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Fixed In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Provided an option to easily create a new path cut by selecting Copy Path Cut button and change the values needed
Taking care of validation while cutting the hour


Let me know if you find any problems.

Thanks,
Will

Good Morning Will,

I haven't heard anything new being released lately, and just wanted to check in to see when I should expect the next release for testing. If the old data is blown away when the new release comes out, I will just run the same data.

Thanks,

Cara,

We have recently added to Table Edit the ability to create aliases for counterparties.  Also you should be able to add extended information about each counterparty.  The tab in Table Edit is ""Counterparty Extensions"" and when you select New...

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Try creating a few aliases and see if they work.  Because the process takes so long, you might limit it to a small number of Paths.  In the meantime, we will be looking into why the process is slow.

Regards,
Will

When I sent this e-mail,  the Workspace error log popped up,  the total running time for the 70 rows of path confirmation was 1 hour 30 minutes, and the rows that were not confirmed were ignored due to the Aliases that Schedulers use.

Subject:	Testing Preschedule workspace

Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet the new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R.  


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On- June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped, and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (West Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longer than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept starting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encouraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with what I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran through its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing.

Thanks

Hi Awesome Asem!

Proper Mapping Should go as Follows:

COB:  COB, COB N/S, COB S/N

PV: Palo Verde

MidC : Mid Columbia

California: NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26

NW MISC: Everything contained within the R-9 (MidColumbia) group except for Mid Columbia, and everything from R8 (WSCC-N) except the COB grouping.  Do you have those lists available?  If not, I will go type them up.

SW Misc:  Everything contained in the R7A (Rockies) region, and everything in the R7 (WSCC-S) region except Palo Verde.

Let's go with the first draft being my extra CSV file, and we can upgrade to include the data in the AGGSchedVol report later after Poston gives me his part.

Thanks,

Cara

Cara,
	Looking into the Physical and Bookout summary reports, upon recreating the functionality there are certain sections to the report which we aren't clear on.. we are still needing to know which delivery points to map the following summary sections to:

	COB
	PV 		[Currently mapped to PALO VERDE]
	MIDC 		[Currently mapped to MID COLUMBIA]
	NWMISC
	SWMISC
	California	[Currently mapped to  NP-15, SP15 and ZP26]


	We've recreated the reporting functionality [excel based]  from within our new application.. and upon obtaining these mappings we can push this out to production for ya'll  asap.  If you'd like to have the summary report information dumped into the 'Aggregate Schedule Volume Report' we can definitely do that; but, would require us more time to get that functionality to you. 

thanks

 The ""California"" region choice will be a combination of R10-R11and R12. (NP-15, SP15, and ZP26 respectively)  

I do not know the desks that control anything on the list below, those all look just like emissions credit desks, which would not be handled by anyone here.

West Power is as Follows
California (as defined above) - EPMI ST-Cali and EPMI LT-Cali
WSCC-S and Rockies:  EPMI ST-SW and EPMI LT-SW
WSCC-N and Northwest: EPMI ST-NW and EPMI LT-NW.

Please note:  Any desk here can trade any point, so even though the STSW has primary control over the daily trades, the body of trades will have probably all desks represented in it.

Subject:	RE: Outstanding Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation

Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report.

Path Confirmation Report:
Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Fixed Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Fixed  Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. 
Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be an error-checking point? 
Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   
Fixed Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserved from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling. 
Fixed, Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Fixed  For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Fixed Transmission should be optional (Confirm with Cara)
Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Added Copy Path Cut Button, it stores all selected path_cut ino, change the required hour and save it.   Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. 
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. 
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a ""Go to Cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

Cara & Corry

I am happy to annouce that we have completed the two new applications which will help scheduling group
with routing and path confirmation. Currently, it is in user STAGE for you to look at ( NOT FOR TESTING ) since
there are few minor issues that need to be resolved with terminal server folks and developers.

New applications are Pre-Schedule Workspace & Path Confirmation which are available under
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Pre-Schedule Workspace
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Path Confirmation

Note that new application will not work under terminal server since it requires a special MS office file
to be installed on TS.

Thanks to all enpower developers for their continued hard work, especially Will Smith's significant contribution
to this project

I am glad to discuss with both you offline for any issues / comments / concerns

Regards,
dluu

Enron Auction Formally Set For Jan. 10,Ct Hearing Jan.11
By Kathy Chu
  
12/20/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge here issued an order late Thursday formally allowing Enron Corp. (ENE) to auction off a majority stake in its energy-trading operations Jan. 10.

The sale is considered crucial to Enron's retention of key traders and customers - as well as to the company's restructuring efforts. 


The decision by federal Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, follows a Wednesday hearing on Enron's motion for an expedited sale of the business. 


All bids must be received by Enron Jan. 7, and a court hearing to approve the buyer will be held Jan. 11. 


The bidders must submit a ""good faith"" deposit of $25 million, according to court documents, to be retained by the bankrupt company pending the January hearing. 


Enron will own 49% of the joint venture, New Energy Trading Co., while the buyer will own 51%. 


The bankrupt company expects bids for its hardware, software - including its online trading platform - and its intellectual property. But potential buyers have expressed little interest so far in Enron's trading contracts, which are valued at $5 billion to $7 billion, according to Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges law firm, which represents the company. 


J.P. Morgan Chase, UBS AG and Citigroup have all expressed interest in the energy-trading business, people familiar with the matter have said. 


J.P. Morgan and Citigroup also recently provided Enron with a $1.5 billion debtor-in-possession financing, and both institutions serve on the company's 15-member official creditors committee. 


At the Wednesday hearing, Luc Despins, of Milbank Tweed law firm - which represents the group - said some creditors on the committee may be ""interested"" in making bids. To stave off potential conflicts, any bidders on the committee will be excluded from discussions about other potential offers for the energy-trading operations, he noted.

"RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation for Target date 6/20","Cara,	

	Thanks for stepping me through Deal Scheduling to see exactly what the problem was in regards to the Physical/Non-Physical issue.  Addressed this issue and we have someone currently looking at this issue and will try and get this kicked out asap. The two other apps are in stage and the schedules for our test date have been erased.. I will notify you immediately once we have Deal Scheduling's issue resolved.

thanks

Cara et all, 

	Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: 

	New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..


PreSchedule Workspace:
#1
Problem:
Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Solution:
Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value.


#2
Problem:
Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix

Solution:
Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open

#3
Problem:
Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Solution:
Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report.

#4
Problem:
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Solution:
Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any.



Path Confirmation:


#1
Problem:
One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

Solution:
Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned.

Routing
Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12 the time is fine.

**needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.


Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20

 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >>  << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  << File: Palo_June20.psc >>  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Thanks,

Cara

"Pre-Schedule Workspace","Cara, Corry,

Here is a consolidation of your input:

Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data.
Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.  
The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM
Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over.
The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records.
Add ""Prepare Next Day"" and ""Copy Workspace"" functionality.
Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color).
Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do.
Daily Summary needs to be completed.
Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation.
Fix ""General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem.
""insert keys"" etc to tool bar.  (example: redo, insert row,...)  Although the sheets in this app are similar to Excel, there are some limitations.  Implementing things like ""redo"" can be complicated if not impossible.  
When you open ""path confirmation"" it defaults to your last user sort settings.  I don't know if this is possible.


Very Important:
We need to determine what is the very least requirements for this application to replace your current processes.  The goal of this application is to allow you to set your excel worksheets aside and work strictly within Pre-Schedule Workspace (PSW).  If with the current approach we are not able to achieve this goal, we need to take a step back are reevaluate our situation.  Also, I can provide some of the basic Excel functionality that is currently missing, but I don't want to get into a situation where I am rewriting Excel.  We need to determine what Excel functionality is a must and what functionality we can do without.

Let me know if you have any other concerns.

Thanks,
Will

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football


 
An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides.""

"RE: Dec and Jan liquidations","Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in ""Schedule"" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

Subject:	Dec and Jan liquidations

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Subject:	Testing Preschedule Workspace

Good Afternoon,

I have been unable to sucessfully test the Preschedule workspace, here are the problems I have run up against:

In the special Terminal server that Will sent me,  I was unable to copy from Excel and paste into the app

In the local system, I was able to copy from Excel and Paste into the app, but it would not allow me to save any data.  The app saved itself as a file, but none of my data were preserved in it. Here is the saved app file that was created.

 << File: MAY_O2_PV.psc >> 

Both locally and in Terminal server, I was unable to close the app.  I had to use the task manager and end task to get me out of the Preschedule workspace viewer.  I did get numerous dialog boxes with various errors, but did not log them all. I can do that if you wish.

I have a set of data re-designed to match the columns of the app, here is the data for May 2.  This will be the approximate size of the sheet if monthly deals are required to be included.

 << File: may2pvhlhdata.xls >> 
Please let me know what I can do to begin testing again,  I am very anxious to get started.

Since we're talking about locations of these summary files.. is the production report located at O:\Portland\WestDesk\SCHEDULING\PhysicalAndBookoutSummary_v2_54_WESTPROD.xls ? unfortunately i dont have access to the directories to find out for myself.

Subject:	New PreSchedule

Cara,

I am ready to release a new Pre Schedule Workspace.  I am hoping that the new version will get you started.  There are some problems that still exist and I have not resolved all of the issues/enhancements previously noted.

NEW:
Instead of ""X""  for Routing we now have...
""X""	Requires routing and path confirmation records
""R""	Requires routing only
""C""	Requires path confirmation records only
""OK""	All requirement tasks completed
"" ""	Do nothing.

Assuming success...
If you have entered ""X"" and route the deals, the ""X"" will change to ""C""
If you have entered ""X"" and create path confirmation records, the ""X"" will change to ""R""
If you have entered ""R"" or ""C"", the value will change to ""OK""

Known problems while creating path confirmation records.  Couterparty ""Aliases"" have not been implemented yet.  We need to take all of the extended counterparty information you have in Lotus Notes to our Oracle database.  In this case you will get the following error messages...

Notice below that to complete the path confirmation record creation took approximately 30 minutes for the file you gave me.  Let me know if this is completely unsatisfactory.  I would like to address basic functionality now and speed issues later.

I noticed some problems with the Path Confirmation Report application.  Another developer is working on fixing those problems.  It is not currently in a working state.

Hoping all goes well,
Will

"RE: ESC Conf Call","Hi Shirley, the first 30 minutes or so were spent on going over the ground
rules that Mike sent out in his 1/30/02, 1:37 pm email.  Then we got into BP
2 on Reservation Timing Requirements and went down the bulleted comments
that Mike sent out with his ground rules, starting with the question of
whether all of the BP's under Order 638 should be in the new BP's.  This
discussion lasted about 30 minutes.  Most of the discussion focused on how
to deal with the various timing issues (granularity, submittals, approvals,
etc.).  Finally, it was suggested that a general statement be put in the
Applicability section that if 638 is superceded, a new rule may be needed on
this BP.

One of the suggestions was that you need to know what your products are
before you can determine the timing issues.  We know FERC will be coming out
with a replacement for the pro forma tariff, but Mike doesn't want to wait
to move forward on the BP's until then.  His goal is to focus on the core
elements of trading/tracking/utilization of rights and then add/subtract
once we know what the new tariff will look like.  It was also suggested that
we may want to set aside a conference call session just to deal with timing
issues to make sure all of the BP's are coordinated on that.

He agreed to clean up the inconsistencies related to resales/notice thereof
in the BP language.  I believe it was also agreed that the BP's for
Transmission should be separate from those for ancillary services (due to
fact that some anc services are purchased in bulk for multiple
transactions).  

Mike is planning the next conf call for next Wed, noon EST and another call
about a week later.  His hope is to go through as many of the BP's as
possible this way.  Today we just got through BP2.

That's about it, unless someone on ESWG has something else to add. 

thanks

"Updates to Pre-Schedule Workspace and Path Confirmation","Cara / Corry,

I have released into stage new versions of PreSchedule and Path Confirmation.  Included in the new release are...

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Fix to ""Variant Conversion"" errors.
Now able to print Error Log.
Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data.
Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.  
The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM
Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over.
The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records.
""Copy Workspace"" functionality.
Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color).
Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do.
Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation.
Fix ""General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem.
'Get  Now' when repeatedly pressed does not cause application to be unstable

Path Confirmation:
?	Added preferences for storing and setting the display colors in the grid
?	""Invalid BLOB handle in record buffer "" error is fixed
?	Enpower counterparty long names are shown 
?	Improved loading time while opening path confirmation dialog
?	Provided an option confirm the paths in batches,  
?	Path cut check box indicator is fixed

"RE: Parallel login requests","Tom & Mike,

To make this easier,  I spoke with Dave Steiner, (Local Portland IT infrastructure) today and told him that their should be 3 ID's established,  One for trading, one for Scheduling and one for Real Time  these ID would be able to access the estate and would not be user specific but would be role specific. This way anyone on the UBS team could use them and each person does not need their own ID.  

If you wish to change this please make sure that Dave Steiner is notified.

Thanks - MO

I have completed most of the work on the Pre-Schedule Workspace.  It is time to get you to take a look at it.  I realize that there may be quite a few things that need ""tweaking"" and others may be missing altogether.  I am depending on you to help me identify any problems.  I am prepared to give you a demo some time today.  Let me know what will be a convenient time.  The Path Confirmation report is also done, and I can demo that for you as well.

Known problems:
Opening and saving large files is too slow. It will take approximately half a day to fix this problem.
The Excel Daily Summary is not done.  I would like to discuss this piece with you in more detail.
It is currently possible to create duplicate confirm entries for the Path Confirm application.
We are working with the Terminal Server guys to get the new app working on terminal server.  This should be done by the end of the week.

"RE: More on the Region Choices for Path Cut","Cara,

We store the region from the path cuts in the database as a single EnPower Region.  That means that we can only map California to one of R10, R11, and R12.  Are you intending the regions within Path Confirmation to represent a group of EnPower Regions?  If so, we will need to make a database change to store those groupings.  I expect that the database change would take a long time because it will involve a Global database change.

Good Afternoon,

I do want the regions to understand Enpower Regions, but at the same time not be so specific to the user.  Here is the breakdown that I would want:

California = R10, R11, and R12

Northwest = R9
	Enpower calls it MidColumbia, but many more delivery points than Just Mid Columbia are contained within it, and I don't want to list them all in the region choice or 	confuse the useres further by them looking for something in the northwest that is not MidColumbia.

WSCC-S=R7

Rockies = R7A

WSCC-N=R8

Please also see my notes below on the existing system. I am happy to provide any further explanation you would like.

Subject:	RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Cara,

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility) This is why I want preset regions, right now they are user defined and a mess
Date
Path
Cuts

I think the best way is to have the sort selection as it is in the new system, by date primarily, and then the nifty sort tool you all have written

Is the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?  Yes

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Good Afternoon,

Here are my findings for the latest Release of the PSW and Path Conf. I am re-running the date of June 22, as I see no data in the path confirmation for that date.

PreSchedule Workspace:

I tried to open the sheet ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  and got this error ""Access violation at address 00000016. Read of address 00000016.  I could not save, close or do anything, I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW.  I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet, and had closed the COB sheet. When I re-opened the ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  sheet, it was completely blank.  This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet. 

Error checking
The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal (#657854.1) that was put in the market deal number area. It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buy/resale.  This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present, but the routing error check mentioned it in rows 69-192, where the deal number was not present. Can the sheet be made to understand that a buy/resale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell?

I also got just ""Error:"" with no explanation of what the error was for rows 3-6, 9-11 and 21-28.  Rows 3-6  and 9-11, has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream, both identified as Portland General System on the sheet. Rows 21-28 I see no errors apparent. 

My second PV sheet gave me  routing error  ""Error:""  with no explanation on rows 2-45.  The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export.  I changed all rows to X, and still got the routing error with no explanation.  I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection. Could it be that the system already detects routes?

 << File: PV_JUNE22_LIMITED.psc >> 



Path Confirmation:

The Transmission information seems to be populating correctly, all trans looks good and has the -E- on each side. I can put my POR/POD info in the Oasis cell, and all the info looks great!
The Global ID Sorting is working just right.
The Tag Sorting is also working just right.
The expanded view is showing the entire path regardless of length.
I like the POR and POD sort capability, this will be very helpful.

In the Expanded View,  even though I know the counterparty, this view sometimes shows me a blank drop down box where the counterparty should be. Allegheney did not show a counterparty name here. This actually looks like it might be specific to Allegheney.

In the line view My counterparty on the sheet CPS shows Constellation Power Source, Inc.  but in the expanded view I see City Public Service of San Antonio. They both have CPS as their short name, but the second counterparty is an East Desk Counterparty. Corry, Can you get their short name changed to something else you like?

Path Cut:

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for.  I only want to see the following:  California   Northwest   WSCC-N   WSCC-S  Rockies.  If I need to provide more explanation on this, I am happy to do so. The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete, and will be cumbersome for real-time and settlements to use.  These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done.

Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done, just over a minute. Users will percieve this as something broken.

I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut, I will hand this off to them very soon.  



Overall Findings:

I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production.  We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue, but the functionality looks really good.  My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from ""X"" date previous the records are in lotus, and from ""X"" date forward they are in the new system. Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both.

Please let me know anything else that I need to do, and when I may test again.  Thanks

Cara

"Paths, Flowgates, and Granularity","Good question, Bob, as this is new to me, too.  Here's my understanding.

While a ""path"" can be either one line or a group of lines, it has a
beginning and an end (a POR and a POD).  Example: Midway to COB.

A ""flowgate"", on the other hand, is a reference monitoring position
(which can physically be a collection of locations lumped into a virtual
point).  It can be used for scheduling as well as for metering and is
generally described as going ""into"" somewhere.  Example: You could
combine COB and NOB into a single flowgate defined as ""Into California
(Southbound)"".

""Granularity"" refers to the degree of detail in your model (i.e., to
what extent it is seen through a wide-angle lens vs. through a
magnifying glass).  So far, I've seen it applied to 
schedule changes (how many times an hour), transmission products (how
small a time increment someone can buy) and transmission grids.  With
respect to transmission grids, it can be used to describe both paths and
flowgates.  Here's a pair of examples: the Mc Cullough 500 - Eldorado
500 path (one line, 3000 feet long -- part of a model with small
granularity), and ""Into WSCC"" (a flowgate in a model with extremely
large granularity).  

When I wrote ""the more granular the flowgate model"" below, I meant ""the
larger the scale of your transmission model by flowgates""; in fact, I
had the ""Into WSCC"" example in mind at the time, whereby someone in the
Eastern Interconnection could conceivably purchase a transmission right
to send energy westward to a sink anywhere in the Western
Interconnection.

I'm cc-ing the rest of the ESWG on this message in case (as I suspect) I
owe our other colleagues the same clarification.

Your fellow student,
John

	Subject:	RE: ESC conference calls to discuss individual
Business Practices

	John, I appreciate your giving the sublists a once-over.  I'll
reply
to
	your comments in the order you wrote them.

	BP 4 says, in essence, ""Before you sell a transmission right,
make
sure
	your grid can support it.""  The gist of BP 9 is: ""If your
Transmission
	Customer wants to move energy someplace not mentioned in the
purchased
	transmission right, but you can still fit it in, then let it
flow
	anyway.""  At the ESC meeting, I was looking past the linkage
statement
	about these two BPs, instead focusing on the fact that BP 4 is
really an
	""OASIS"" practice while BP 9 is about energy scheduling.  Now,
though, in
	the tranquility of my office, I'm inclined to agree that they
should
	still be considered together.  Both of these BPs give you a
choice
	between path and flowgate models (and the more granular the
flowgate
	model, the closer you get to a purely financial transmission
market), so
	how would you feel about calling both of them
""model-independent""?

	BP 25 discusses fragmentary scheduling (i.e., letting a group of
	entities in the transaction chain submit pieces of a schedule
which,
	when pieced together, form a complete and continuous schedule).
As
	written, the BP doesn't seem to tie us to any particular
transmission
	model, because the fragments could conceivably use any
combination
of
	physical and financial transmission rights.  So this BP would
appear
to
	belong in the ""model independent"" category.

	We in the West have suggested a rewording of BP 1, 10 and 12
(hopefully,
	soon to be shared with the ESC) to allow regions like ours to
minimize
	the operational impact of changing the frequency and duration of
	non-emergency generator ramping.  As drafted, these changes
would
have
	no effect on current practices in the East, so more than one
version
of
	each BP would be unnecessary.

	The ""Applicability"" section of BP 24 reads, in part: ""This
Business
	Practice addresses the implementation of a curtailment/reload by
(a
	Scheduling Authority).  It does not address the  process items
leading
	up to the curtailment ...""  I would say that BP 24 does not
depend
on
	the choice of congestion management method selected.

	By the way, I'm sharing these comments with ESC Business
Practice
Task
	Force Chair Mike McElhany, who is apportioning the BP
discussions
among
	a series of conference calls to begin as early as January 30.

	Thank you, John, for your valuable input.

	John, just a couple of quick comments. 

	First BP 9 is identified as an ""independent issue"" and BP 4 is
	identified as
	a ""dependent Issues"", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I
would
	think
	both of these should be ""dependent"",  unless I am missing
something.
I
	guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

	The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is
asking
to
	be
	worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West
and
East
	proposal for each of these practices?  

	Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common
(nationwide)

We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.  These logins are to allw the ubs schedulers to continue to perform for us after there login is converted to the ubs system.  I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what?

Good Morning,

I will create another test day to look at all these changes, my target date is June 21.  

I will need routing records removed from the following points for that day:

MidColumbia
COB N/S
Portland General System
BPA Busbar
Palo Verde
Midway-PSC
Mead-230
Four Corners
West Wing

Please let me know when these routes are cleared and I will start re-populating data.  It will take me an hour or so to create the new spreadsheets for that day.

Thanks,

Subject:	Updates to Pre-Schedule Workspace and Path Confirmation

Cara / Corry,

I have released into stage new versions of PreSchedule and Path Confirmation.  Included in the new release are...

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Fix to ""Variant Conversion"" errors.
Now able to print Error Log.
Border2 is not required for creating confirmation records nor for creating route data.
Include Transmission information in the path when creating confirmation records.  
The path should resemble:  UPSTREAM-SUPPLY-E-TRAN1(OASIS ID)-E-TRAN2(OASIS ID)-E- ... -MARKET-DOWNSTREAM
Make Build Route sheet read only to prevent removal of data.  Build Routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.  Add an option to clear the sheet to start over.
The transmission deal number is not required for path confirmation records.
""Copy Workspace"" functionality.
Allow change font properties (color, bold, etc) and cell properties (highlight color).
Allow searching in the sheets. e.g. search for a deal number.  A simple search for string or number will do.
Neither Upstream nor Downstream are required for path creation.
Fix ""General SQL error.  ORA-02289: sequence does not exist"" problem.
'Get  Now' when repeatedly pressed does not cause application to be unstable

Path Confirmation:
?	Added preferences for storing and setting the display colors in the grid
?	""Invalid BLOB handle in record buffer "" error is fixed
?	Enpower counterparty long names are shown 
?	Improved loading time while opening path confirmation dialog
?	Provided an option confirm the paths in batches,  
?	Path cut check box indicator is fixed

Will

"RE: Power Trading Systems Weekly Update","Steve,
I wasn't aware I was asking for anything additional.  Will asked us to test this application and it did not work (neither the routing feature nor the confirmation).
We discussed possible solutions and tweaking of his prototype.  In addition to possible ideas to get his application going, I reminded him that this is to replace an existing workspace (excel) that has many more features (such as the insert keys, font colors, shading, etc).  If the goal was to replace our excel workspace, this would be a good start.  Since ""buildroute"" has been, and will be, a fundamental part of East Scheduling we agreed that the new version should save in the same manner it does now, nothing more.

Thanks,
Corry

Cara, Yes, primarily due to some additional requests that Corry has surfaced during user acceptance testing.  (I copied Corry on this in case you want to discuss with him)  He is looking for a number of excel type features that are not part of Will's grid object.  Will is doing some additional research for me on this...

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Amy

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Cara,

We have recently added to Table Edit the ability to create aliases for counterparties.  Also you should be able to add extended information about each counterparty.  The tab in Table Edit is ""Counterparty Extensions"" and when you select New...

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Try creating a few aliases and see if they work.  Because the process takes so long, you might limit it to a small number of Paths.  In the meantime, we will be looking into why the process is slow.

Will

Subject:	Testing Preschedule workspace

Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet the new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R.  


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On- June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped, and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (West Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longer than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept starting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encouraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with what I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran through its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing.

Thanks

What I meant was I would run one day and put test data in the production sheet (since there is not a test sheet of that), and then go get rid of that day when it looks like it calculated right.

I know so little about that sheet, I am a typical user and just know what I want.  How long after the initial release into production do you all think It will be until we get the project cleared to have this data merged with the AggSchedVol Data? That is the ultimate goal.  Poston has his FSP data that will be part of this too.

	Not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you log in against PWRPRODN, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe.. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summary detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros and such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.. do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy to help.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Will,

I moved  the new version of PathConfirm.Exe into P:\PowerSys\Stage, Please migrate this version into stage.

In new version of Path Confirmation following items are fixed

?	Fixed - Provide an option to delete bogus confirmation records
?	Added radio button - Cut Type Code. is vague, I think we need a button here.  Now we have a forced choice button of Hour-Ahead or Real-Time which works well.
?	Fixed  - Scheduled path quantity is vague, this should be Cut Volume.
?	By default it shows the original path now, New Path Text - If we make the New Path cut part of the Expanded view of the original path, then we could show Original Path, New path, and the user could copy  and make small changes to the new path instead of typing the whole thing in.
?	Follows Deal Entry Standards - The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
?	Fixed - The Annuity field currently does not recognize any number. It also should be able to function with NO number in it, as a typical resupply will not need an annuity. 	
?	Resupply Deal # - This also needs a choice. It will either be a New supply or a New Sink. This should need a deal number to proceed. Right now it does not like the deal number plus decimal.  I think to be consistent we need to require it everywhere a deal number is required
?	Fixed - Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.

"Rhetorical Excess, Says Lockyer","

January 23, 2002 
Dow Jones Newswires
Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

Are you the person who can tell me if Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power Co. are timely paying their bills with respect to term power being sold to them by EPMI/OldCo?  I need to know for a complaint these parties filed at the FERC in which they are asking for relief from the terms of the deal.

I would be interested in knowing when power delivered in January '02 will become due and if they paid on that date.

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

Love,

Good Afternoon,

I have been unable to sucessfully test the Preschedule workspace, here are the problems I have run up against:

In the special Terminal server that Will sent me,  I was unable to copy from Excel and paste into the app

In the local system, I was able to copy from Excel and Paste into the app, but it would not allow me to save any data.  The app saved itself as a file, but none of my data were preserved in it. Here is the saved app file that was created.

 << File: MAY_O2_PV.psc >> 

Both locally and in Terminal server, I was unable to close the app.  I had to use the task manager and end task to get me out of the Preschedule workspace viewer.  I did get numerous dialog boxes with various errors, but did not log them all. I can do that if you wish.

I have a set of data re-designed to match the columns of the app, here is the data for May 2.  This will be the approximate size of the sheet if monthly deals are required to be included.

 << File: may2pvhlhdata.xls >> 
Please let me know what I can do to begin testing again,  I am very anxious to get started.

"RE: Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date","Good Morning All,

I will talk to Corry about how we need our transmission represented.  The format is ok, I just need more information in the path or the ability to put the entire block of the transmission we buy in the -E- cell. I am going to experiment with a couple of things to see how the output looks in the Confirm.

When I try to sort Global ID or tags, I can't drag the box up to the sort area.  I get a slash-zero icon.

Using a smaller set of data does not seem to change the relative speed of the confirm upload. It looks like each path takes roughly 5-6 minutes to do. I am only putting physical paths in the confirm upload, which reduces the data set dramatically.

I have routed MidC for 6/21, the BPA deals left unrouted are 486140.1 and 308337.1.  The original delivery point in the deal is NW delivered, and then we move it in scheduling every day to go where it is needed. This type of deal will always be done, and there are other deals that get moved in the Southwest as well.  There is a WALC transmission deal that is at Pinnacle Peak, and is changed daily in scheduling to West Wing.

The deals missing dashes seem to all be the same.  Here is one example: EPMI(G)SP15-CISO(T)SP15/PVD #CISO_EPMI_5001-EPMICALPOOAPS (22545)-VALLEYALL DAYS HLH DEAL-
Here is how the path should look if the dashes were placed correctly :EPMI(G)SP15-CISO(T)SP15/PVD #CISO_EPMI_5001-EPMICALPOO-APS (22545)-VALLEY-ALL DAYS HLH DEAL



I  still  cannot get my PV sheet to upload to the confirm dbase properly.  I got  the Access Violation errors yesterday, and so end-tasked to get out and logged off and went home.  today, it looks like it is running, but I got the access violation errors again today.  I am going to save the same data to a new file, and try to run it under a different name. The COB sheet seems to be running, so hopefully the error is imbedded in the one sheet.

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  There is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system.

I don't remember our discussions making this only a possibility. I remember it being an improvement to existing systems, and a reduction in redundant work because everything would be enpower now.  I would like to explore how to make this part of the release. It seems to me that it would be more work to make it half what we need now and then keep adding to it to get to our goal. 

I will keep testing today, and bring more findings this afternoon.

Thanks,

Cara

Subject:	RE: Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date

Cara,

PreSchedule:
1.  Concerning the path with transmission data...  The original format was based off of Corry's suggestion.  Perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs.  However, I should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission, otherwise there is no way for us to determine the POR, POD and firmness for the transmission deal. 

2.  Can you give Asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the Northwest Delivered deals with multiple delivery points?

3.  We will resolve the physical / non-physical in the next release, as well as add a ""Check for Errors"" button.

4.  Determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming.  We will work on it right away, but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data.  We will get you a faster solution as soon as possible.

Path Confirm:
1.  Sorting...  Are Global ID and Tag sorting, just not in an order that you expect?  Our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons.  If you need the values sorted by numbers, putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you.

2.  Can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes?

3.  I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market.  If the delivery points are different, should we require a transmission path record?

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  There is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system.


Again, thanks for your testing efforts.  We have come a long way due to your diligence.

Subject:	Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date

Good Afternoon:

I have created PSW documents for all 4 of my regions for June 21, here are my findings today:

In PreSchedule Workspace:

What worked:
I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW.
I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed.
I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will.
When running the Confirm function:
I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors.
The routing speed was still very good.

What needs improvement:
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000.
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet.
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical.
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points.

Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now?  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission.  
( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP,  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be :  SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP.  This is incomplete information.)

OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS,  put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F.


In Path Confirmation:

What worked:
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better.
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER.
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked.


What still needs work:
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of ""PWX Tag 123""  show ""123 (PWX TAG)?"" Some marketers use letters for tags.
The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path.
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. 
The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work.

New path needs work as well.  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list.
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
	The new record should be three tiered.  Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems.
	How are these new records going to be routed?
	Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut.




I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work.


We are getting there, I am very encouraged!

"RE: Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date","Cara,

PreSchedule:
1.  Concerning the path with transmission data...  The original format was based off of Corry's suggestion.  Perhaps the two of you need to discuss your needs.  However, I should tell you that your approach will require a database access for each transmission, otherwise there is no way for us to determine the POR, POD and firmness for the transmission deal. 

2.  Can you give Asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the Northwest Delivered deals with multiple delivery points?

3.  We will resolve the physical / non-physical in the next release, as well as add a ""Check for Errors"" button.

4.  Determining the cause of the speed issues with creating the confirm records can be time consuming.  We will work on it right away, but in the meantime try working with smaller sets of data.  We will get you a faster solution as soon as possible.

Path Confirm:
1.  Sorting...  Are Global ID and Tag sorting, just not in an order that you expect?  Our tools are sorting strictly by alphanumeric comparisons.  If you need the values sorted by numbers, putting the numbers ahead of the description will work better for you.

2.  Can you give me a specific example of a path that is missing dashes?

3.  I will have Vish change the New Path functionality to require both Supply and Market.  If the delivery points are different, should we require a transmission path record?

4.  I know we discussed the possibility of tying the new path and path cuts to our other EnPower systems.  I apologize if I did not make it clear that this would be a complicated process involving changes to those other applications.  There is currently no plan for including those features in this release.  Our goal for the first release was to replace your existing Lotus Notes system.


Again, thanks for your testing efforts.  We have come a long way due to your diligence.

Regards,
Will

Subject:	Preschedule Workspace Testing-June 21 target date

Good Afternoon:

I have created PSW documents for all 4 of my regions for June 21, here are my findings today:

In PreSchedule Workspace:

What worked:
I was still able to successfully copy and paste large amounts of excel data into the PSW.
I was able to query build route successfully for each delivery point I needed.
I was able to change the color of text and fonts at will.
When running the Confirm function:
I was able to print the error log, which was helpful when I had to fix a few counterparty errors.
The routing speed was still very good.

What needs improvement:
The run time for the Confirm function is still far too slow to be useful in production. The rockies sheet alone took 2 hours to upload, the Mid C sheet took over two hours. I have not been able to populate the full data set because of this speed issue. I will continue uploading today, and try tomorrow to look at the full data set in confirm. I could not import the Palo Verde sheet in to confirm. I got this error message :ERROR:Access violation at address 004ED7E3 in module 'PreSchedWS.exe'. Read of address 00000000.
We need the ability to check for errors before running the sheet, I used another half hour fixing the errors and re-running the sheet.
A spot check of routing shows that the routes are still not showing the appropriate flag for physical vs non-physical. Everything shows non-physical.
Routing still did not happen on the Northwest Delivered deals that were moved in scheduling to multiple delivery points.

Question: Will the sheet support the capability of our transmission legs showing up where the E is now?  the weakness with having the path show from transmission 1, 2, etc, is it does not give the POR/POD or the firmness of the transmission.  
( The way a path should look is like this: SRP@PV-E-APS(T)PV/WW O#23305 F-WALC(T)WW/MEAD O#464521 MNF-EPMI-NEVP,  the way this same path would show if put in to the sheet as it is now will be :  SRP@PV-E-APS(23305)-WALC(464521)-NEVP.  This is incomplete information.)

OR, would it be possible to modify the sheet to accept the following information in the Trans and Oasis number cells? Instead of APS,  put APS(T)PV/WW and in the OASIS cell put 23305 F.


In Path Confirmation:

What worked:
I was able to choose and reset colors that help me read the information better.
The speed to pull up an individual path is MUCH BETTER.
I was able to select a group of paths in the line view and attempt to confirm them. The save takes too long, but it worked.


What still needs work:
I still cannot sort by Global ID or Tag number. Would a different tag logic work, instead of ""PWX Tag 123""  show ""123 (PWX TAG)?"" Some marketers use letters for tags.
The cell with the path in the expanded view must auto-size to contain all of the path.
The program needs to insert a dash in the path when each cell boundary is passed.Upstream-Supply-E-Trans-Trans-Trans-Market-Downstream.Right now some run together. 
The path cut needs work, it is cumbersome, unclear on some entry requirements, and does not seem to recognize any number I put in it. This app seems like guess-work.

New path needs work as well.  
	The POR and POD needs to be a type and complete field( like in build route selection) not a first letter drop down list.
	The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
	The new record should be three tiered.  Supply first, then market,(both mandatory entry), then transmission as an optional third. To allow a Supply without a Market 	record is going to create many problems.
	How are these new records going to be routed?
	Also, our original intent was that the new path and path cut would drive deal entry, not deal entry being done and then numbers populated into Path Cut.




I will continue testing tomorrow, the hotspots I see now are the upload speed to Path confirmation, and a close look at how we need the Path Cut and New Path to work.


We are getting there, I am very encouraged!

Cara

"Office Update","Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron.  

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addition to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepted positions with UBS Warburg:

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

Subject:	Testing the PSW and Path Confirm Report

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening;

I started working in June 22 to test path cut capabilities.  I was able to save a cut path.  

Please make sure that Bill Williams III and Whomever he designates has access to Enpower TestP so that I can walk them through the app when it is ready. Right now it looks like Mark Guzman and Kate Symes will be the voice of West Real time.

A Real Time Question:
When Enpower is taken down for maintenance, as it sometimes is at night, will this application still function?  If not, we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when Enpower is being maintained.


Re-Running June 20th as a completely new day: This entire test was done in local Enpower

PreSchedule Workspace:

Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix
	
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message)

Daily Summary Function

Routing:*accepted Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12



Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confrim button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

What I meant was I would run one day and put test data in the production sheet (since there is not a test sheet of that), and then go get rid of that day when it looks like it calculated right.

I know so little about that sheet, I am a typical user and just know what I want.  How long after the initial release into production do you all think It will be until we get the project cleared to have this data merged with the AggSchedVol Data? That is the ultimate goal.  Poston has his FSP data that will be part of this too.

	Not a prob, the application wont look at the prod summary file unless you log in against PWRPRODN, so if you are logging against the test db's yer safe.. and for the summary to work it does require at least one previous summary detail in that excel file to work.. it uses that excel's defined macros and such to calculate the totals.. so doing a complete purge wouldnt do good.. do let me know if you have any questions about this.. be more than happy to help.

Subject:	Testing the PSW

Good Evening,

We had agreed to just do a test to see what issues were still outstanding in the PSW and Path Confirmation.

I re-ran all the data for June 22 in the West, here are my findings:


Some little things seem to have changed, I am not sure why they changed

PreSchedule Workspace - Pressing the Enter key makes the cursor go to the cell to the left, and no other way.  Enter+Shift moves the cursor to the right.  This function is different, the Enter key used to function much like it did in Excel, and I am not sure why this change has been made.

Path confrimation - The color Pallette is very different, and inferior. Did that get changed? Any color not on the main pallette is now grainy and difficult to read the path thru.
 also, the color on the path is the chosen color, but several fields show as dark grey no matter what color is chosen.  There also seems to be no pattern to why some cells are grey and some aren't.

The window for the error report now snaps up very small. It was defaulting to the same size as the PSW. This seems different and inferior.


Functionality bug still to be fixed:

I routed all of the deals for all the western points, and a spot check still shows that the Physical flag is not showing up properly in Deal Scheduling, although it does show properly in Path Confirmation. I checked many routed deals, not one showed the Physical flag checked.

Pending features that I am not sure of the status on:

The Real Time discussion that is currently part of Lotus, but spoke with Poston regarding and I believe he is heading up this effort with you all.

The Executive report that will replace the AGGSchedVol report and the Daily Excel Summary.

In summary:

All other functions seem to be working, and as soon as we nail down the routing one, I can pass the testing off to real time for their final changes before going to production.
It is my intention that once we go to production we have one entire month of parallell testing before the Lotus system is abandoned.

Thanks for your work, let me know when you are ready for me to test again.  I would like to re-test June 22 again if possible.

Thanks,

Cara

"RE: Testing PreSchedule Workspace-June20","Cara,

My comments...

Alias Tables:
Vish is making some changes to Table Edit.  As soon as he is done I will demo it for you.  Showing the counterparty name rather than the code is no problem.

Routing Errors:
Asem is looking into the ""Term Code"" errors.

Path Confimation:
1.  To alleviate some of the time issues, we will attempt to log all errors on a record rather than only the first error.  Also, we will be trying to find the bottleneck in the confirm process.

2.  Asem is looking into the ""Variant Conversion"" errors.

3.A.  I believe the full path is being displayed, but you are not able to see it because the column needs to be sized larger.  I will have Vish auto-size that column

3.B.  Vish is working on this.

3.C.  Vish is working on this.

Subject:	Testing PreSchedule Workspace-June20

Good Afternoon;

I have spent the last 3 1/2 hours working in the preschedule workspace dealing with June 20th, delivery points West Wing, Mead 230, Craig, Four Corners 345, Midway-PSC. These are small points that are complicated and use transmission for the paths.  Here is the completed PSW sheet for your analysis.

 << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 


What worked:

Routing worked at Midway, which was a shaped hourly schedule, expressed as a shaped hourly schedule on the sheet. Craig routed, and So did Four Corners. 

Path Confirmation: still took over an hour to run,  but data is populated in the system now.  Please see my notes below for what did not work. From my preliminary view, the data appears to be correct, but I am going to leave final determination of the usability of this format for the decision of Bill Williams III and our real time group.  I was able to do some sorting and things look really good. The speed of the sort and pulling up batch info looks great.



What did not work:


Routing: West Wing and Mead did not route,  I got errors on 46 rows ""Error: Invalid Routing Term Code"".  The Term Column says DAY.  Does this error message reflect some other error?

Alias Tables: We seem to have a major disconnect between our original intention and what is going on here.  The original intention  is that if the scheduler sheet says ""PINW"" instead of ""PINNACLEWE"", the program will understand that and populate all schedules with PINW in  the proper counterparty of Pinnacle West in the Confirm View.  Right now, the sheet is omitting the paths without the ENPOWER long name, and using the aliases as counterparty names in the Path Confirmation VIEW.  The Path Confirmation View should give the Long Name that we see in Table Edit Field ""Counterparty"". The Alias list is to help schedulers not have to use really long and cryptic acronyms when dealing with multiple paths.  Please call me so that we can talk about this ,  it seems like we are totally not understanding each other here.

Path Confirmation: 
	1.Each time I ran my confirmation button, it took an hour, I would find an error, and run it again, it took another hour, I would see another error, and it took another 	hour.  3 hours to run one little sheet is no good. 

	2. Path confirmation also omitted 4 schedules with the error of ""Invalid Variant Type Conversion"".  The common thread in all of these paths is that they are 	generated at one point, and have transmission deals, and end up at a different point.  All transmission deals are entered properly in the sheet. These are lines 12-14 	and line 35 in the attached sheet.

	3. The data that has populated into the Confirmation system has problems.  

		A.  For each Counterparty,  we need to see the ENTIRE path.  Not just what is in the portion that the marketer has above or below them.

		B. The confirming of each path must be able to be done quickly.  Double clicking the path, waiting two minutes and then populating a name is too long. 		Currently in Lotus, the operator holds down the shift key, and mouse clicks on each path that is confirmed with the counterparty.  This puts a check by 		each line. The operator then clicks ""Confirm"" and the dialog box with the time stamp and field for name appears.  When the name is populated and the 		operator clicks ""OK""  each path is confirmed as a batch.

		C. The name that appears when I look up ""Party"" should be the long name that appears in the table edit field ""Counterparty"".  The phone number should 		also populate on that line, as well as the check box if it is checked. This is consistent with what we have now. The name that appears now is the Enpower 		short name or the alias.

	
Other functions will be evaluated tomorrow.  I have a meeting for the remainder of the day, but will be available tomorrow for some testing.  I have committments until 9 am or so.

"Supplemental Notice -- Request for Comments on WESM Proposal","The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) on December 4,
2001, posted for public comment a proposed Wholesale Electric Standards
Model (WESM) -- an industry-based consensus process for developing,
maintaining, and publishing standards that promote reliable and
efficient wholesale electricity markets throughout North America.  Such
standards would address, in an integrated way, the whole spectrum of
reliability, market interface, and business practice standards through a
fair, open, balanced, and inclusive stakeholder process.

On December 19, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
an Order Providing Guidance on the Formation of a Standards Development
Organization for the Wholesale Electric Industry (Docket No.
RM01-12-00).  That order directs the industry to reach agreement on the
formation of an organization to develop consensus standards for business
practices and electronic communications.  If the industry cannot reach
consensus on this issue by March 15, the Commission indicated that it
will either institute its own procedures to choose an organization or
will develop the standards itself.

To provide the NERC Standing Committees Representation Task Force
(SCRTF) as well as the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees
the broadest possible input, the Board strongly urges all interested
parties to comment on the WESM proposal in the context of the recent
FERC order.  Commenters should give particular attention to how NERC and
the recently approved North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB)
could collaborate in developing and overseeing a single, industry-based
consensus process to develop standards that assure the continued
reliable operation of the integrated North American electric
transmission grids as well as the development of business practice
standards and communication protocols needed to complement the market
design principles that FERC has announced its intention to develop.

NERC's SCRTF will use all comments received to help shape its final
proposal to the NERC Stakeholders Committee and Board of Trustees in
February 2002.  We also intend to provide the input we receive in this
public forum on the WESM model to FERC for its consideration. 

For additional information on the SCRTF and its membership, go to:
www.nerc.com/committees/scrtf.html. Please direct questions to David
Nevius, NERC Vice President, at 609-452-8060, or e-mail
dave.nevius@nerc.com.

The proposal is posted at the following NERC web site:
http://www.nerc.com/. The deadline for comments is January 8, 2002.

Sincerely,

Heather Gibbs

We have recently added to Table Edit the ability to create aliases for counterparties.  Also you should be able to add extended information about each counterparty.  The tab in Table Edit is ""Counterparty Extensions"" and when you select New...

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Try creating a few aliases and see if they work.  Because the process takes so long, you might limit it to a small number of Paths.  In the meantime, we will be looking into why the process is slow.

Subject:	Testing Preschedule workspace

Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet the new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R.  


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On- June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped, and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (West Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longer than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept starting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encouraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with what I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran through its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing.

Thanks

"RE: Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and Path Cut software","Cara,
I agree that we should reduce the number of ""names"" from a global standpoint now while we can.  
The routing portion of the workspace seems to work well, I agree, but the major issues lie with the confirmation side of it.
On another note, it seems I am duplicating work here.  ie: I am using buildroute, transferring to excel (to get the font/colors, etc) then back to the workspace.
We'll see...I'll hit it again next week.
Thanks for all your ""documented"" input...it sure helps.

Subject:	Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and Path Cut software

I am working in the target date of June 20th.  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume.

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >> 


In Preschedule Workspace:

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only.  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements.

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time.  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards.

Routing functionality question:  If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point?  These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" Please see the attached sheet, there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86, but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered.

The routing speed is EXCELLENT. One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower! The megawatts also appear to split properly between mis-matched deal amounts! this is very encouraging. My Palo data was corrupted, so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points.

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle. We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower ""short name"" to something that is workable.  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name. 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good, things look very versatile and useable. 

Yesterday I identified several problems:

1. The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths. Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp.

2. The Alias list is not functioning properly.  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view, along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp.

3. Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch, not pulling up each deal line by line.


Today, I am finding the following:

1.  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view,  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point.  These fields have to be re-populated before saving can occur.

2.I am not allowed to sort by Global ID,  even though global IDs are populated there. My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section, no globals go in another section, and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers. (just like the phys vs. non phys).

3. Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes.  This is to long to be practical in production for real time. I would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less.

4.  All paths are showing up as being cut (cut checkbox checked), even though none have been cut yet.

5. The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work, but that is a little thing. Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable. Variations of the beige color are easier to read.

6. The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'.

7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that.



Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good. 
I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks.

Cara

	Looking at the Stage and Production versions of the deal scheduling application it looks like the stage version has some issues/differences.. [e.g being that check option for cross portfolio deals is in stage and not production release].  This issue will be addressed but the current workaround would be to make sure the checkbox is checked in stage for retrieving proper results.. 

	Please do let me know if you have any questions/concerns..

	You are correct, if run with the params you supplied there are no results.. I did go ahead and check the option to 'Include Cross Portfolio Deals' and deals did then show up.. please do try it with that option checked and let me know.

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path Confirmation done on 8/23

Good Evening,

I wanted to poke around a bit and see if I could find anything quickly so you all could proceed.

Path Confirmation:

I like the new way the confirm box pops up.  

Path Cut,

I tried to cut a path for 6/21, got through all the usual screens, and added my info,  I got the following error:

""Cannot be updated. Key Violation. ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_SCHD_PATH_CUTS) violated""  no cut information was saved.


I still cannot get anything to show up in scheduling.  I tried West Wing for 6/21,  PV for 6/22, and Mid C for 6/23. The software says it is loading deals, but no results are showing in the filter or the schedule screen.
I have to be able to really test the routing, so  we need to get this resolved.  Most of the routing looked ok, except the deals changed in scheduling would not route and the Physical vs Non-physical flag was not being triggered properly. Because our physical and non-physical volumes are tracked through Enpower and recorded for the WSCC and NERC fees that we pay, this information needs to be correct.


I will stay late, come in early, or whatever it takes to get things tested.  


Thanks,

Cara

Subject:	Office Update

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron.  

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addition to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepted positions with UBS Warburg:

Last Name	First Name	Last Name	First Name	
Amador	Susan	Oh	John	
Anderson	John	Platter	M	
Bulbes	Victor	Postlethwaite	John	
Chang	Fang-Tzu	Richter	Jeffrey	
Chatterton	Jill	Robinson	Donald	
Crandall	Sean	Salisbury	Holden	
Cutsforth	Diane	Scholtes	Diana

Meyers	Albert	Woodland	Andrea	
Mier	Michael	Yoder	Christian	
Nelson	Kourtney			

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

Subject:	Testing the PSW and Path Confirm Report

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening;

I started working in June 22 to test path cut capabilities.  I was able to save a cut path.  

Please make sure that Bill Williams III and Whomever he designates has access to Enpower TestP so that I can walk them through the app when it is ready. Right now it looks like Mark Guzman and Kate Symes will be the voice of West Real time.

A Real Time Question:
When Enpower is taken down for maintenance, as it sometimes is at night, will this application still function?  If not, we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when Enpower is being maintained.


Re-Running June 20th as a completely new day: This entire test was done in local Enpower

PreSchedule Workspace:

Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix
	
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message)

Daily Summary Function

Routing:*accepted Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12



Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confrim button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Subject:	Testing the PSW

Good Evening,

We had agreed to just do a test to see what issues were still outstanding in the PSW and Path Confirmation.

I re-ran all the data for June 22 in the West, here are my findings:


Some little things seem to have changed, I am not sure why they changed

>PreSchedule Workspace - Pressing the Enter key makes the cursor go to the cell to the left, and no other way.  Enter+Shift moves the cursor to the right.  This function is different, the Enter key used to function much like it did in Excel, and I am not sure why this change has been made.
Problem fixed - in STAGE


>Path confrimation - The color Pallette is very different, and inferior. Did that get changed? Any color not on the main pallette is now grainy and difficult to read the path thru.
 also, the color on the path is the chosen color, but several fields show as dark grey no matter what color is chosen.  There also seems to be no pattern to why some cells are grey and some aren't.
We did not change color scheme, however, you can reset the default color by click on grid colors button on the tool bar

>The window for the error report now snaps up very small. It was defaulting to the same size as the PSW. This seems different and inferior.
Problem fixed - in STAGE


Functionality bug still to be fixed:

>I routed all of the deals for all the western points, and a spot check still shows that the Physical flag is not showing up properly in Deal Scheduling, although it does show properly in Path Confirmation. I checked many routed deals, not one showed the Physical flag checked.
Problem fixed - in STAGE


Pending features that I am not sure of the status on:

>The Real Time discussion that is currently part of Lotus, but spoke with Poston regarding and I believe he is heading up this effort with you all.
We are currently looking to the solution to this problem. If this feature prevent us from going live, i would suggest that Steve Nat, Dave Poston, you and i need to discuss. 

>The Executive report that will replace the AGGSchedVol report and the Daily Excel Summary.
Yes, the new application is available under EnPower launchpad -> Tools -> Executive Report.

In summary:

All other functions seem to be working, and as soon as we nail down the routing one, I can pass the testing off to real time for their final changes before going to production.
It is my intention that once we go to production we have one entire month of parallell testing before the Lotus system is abandoned.

Thanks for your work, let me know when you are ready for me to test again.  I would like to re-test June 22 again if possible.

Thanks,

Cara

The problem continues,  I could pull up the schedules in Scheduling, but they are all routed, so I rescheduled the entire day of June 15, which is the day I will test, and when I did,  I queried scheduling for the 15th, and when the schedules came up they show no mw's but do show a route, but only for the 16th.

I don't know why that is happening. I am trying to get my sheet re-set up for the 16th of june, to try all over again.

Can you see if you all can get me clean unrouted Palo Verde data for June 16th???

Subject:	Testing Preschedule workspace

Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet the new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R.  


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On- June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped, and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (West Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longer than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept starting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encouraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with what I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran through its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing.

Thanks

"Pre-Schedule WS and Path Confirmation","Corry, Cara,

There are new versions have been released to stage.

What's new and what's fixed:

Pre-Schedule Workspace:
Now able to select a Trading Region/Desk (EAST or WEST) to separate path confirm records.
Confirm record creation should be significantly faster.  Let me know if the speed is still unacceptable.
Issues with Aliases should be fixed.  (This covers your problem, Corry).
Now able to Check for confirm errors without saving to confirm report.

Path Confirmation
?	Fixed - Provide an option to delete bogus confirmation records
?	Added radio button - Cut Type Code. is vague, I think we need a button here.  Now we have a forced choice button of Hour-Ahead or Real-Time which works well.
?	Fixed  - Scheduled path quantity is vague, this should be Cut Volume.
?	By default it shows the original path now, New Path Text - If we make the New Path cut part of the Expanded view of the original path, then we could show Original Path, New path, and the user could copy  and make small changes to the new path instead of typing the whole thing in.
?	Follows Deal Entry Standards - The Counterparty list is just too confusing and cumbersome to be practical. It should mimic the deal entry list.
?	Fixed - The Annuity field currently does not recognize any number. It also should be able to function with NO number in it, as a typical resupply will not need an annuity. 	
?	Resupply Deal # - This also needs a choice. It will either be a New supply or a New Sink. This should need a deal number to proceed. Right now it does not like the deal number plus decimal.  I think to be consistent we need to require it everywhere a deal number is required
?	Fixed - Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.

Will

""Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song. We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special. This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good. Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season.

According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world. Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life. 	 Picture of President and Laura Bush in front of Christmas tree at the whitehouse <http://216.157.79.171/christmas/presidentbush.jpg>	
At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ. And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.

This Christmas we remember those who are without their loved ones. They continue to be in our hearts and prayers. May they experience peace, and may they find hope. And as we again celebrate Christ's birth, may the glorious light of God's goodness and love shine forth from our land.

Laura joins me in wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. May God's blessings of peace be upon us and upon the world.""

GEORGE W. BUSH

Our President understands and 
believes in the real meaning of Christmas.  
Feel free to forward his meaningful Christmas 
greeting to all of your friends and loved ones

Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

---------------------------

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

---------------------------

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/Company_Information.doc

---------------------------

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

Subject: RE: ESC Conference Call to discuss Business Practices


I have to caution against copying the S&CP 1.4, or the closely related
Order 638, into the OASIS Phase 2 business practices. They should merely
be reviewed to avoid missing anything.  Copying in parts of Order 638
have already created direct conflict between some of the business
practices.  It's important to remember that the S&CP 1.4 is the solution
to business needs that existed 2-5 years ago and that were a much
smaller subset of the business needs of OASIS Phase 2.  Slapping an old
solution onto a new problem is rarely, if ever, advisable.  

There is a lot of technical implementation detail in Order 638 that
should be avoided in the new business practices.  Instead the BPs should
focus on WHAT (business requirements). The HOW (design & implementation)
should be covered by the new S&CP.  For instance, instead of covering
the specific state change of ""COUNTEROFFER"", cover the general business
processes of negotiation.  Nothing in the BP's even says that
negotiation can occur, much less what can be negotiated. Is it just
price, or is it capacity and time as well, or is it something else?   

I'd suggest you start by defining what the transmission products are.
The existing definitions don't fit some of the BP's. 
Then cover the processes for obtaining them.  For instance:
- Buyers submit requests for what and to whom? (source to sink submitted
to many sellers all at once, or partial path to one seller at a time?
What data is required or optional?  Can they agree in advance to accept
the current posted price? Can they agree in advance to accept whatever
capacity is available?)
- Sellers do what with the request? (negotiate terms, approve request,
reject request according to what rules, etc)
- Buyers do what during negotiation process? (accept terms, suggest
other terms, match another buyers bid, reject the terms, etc.)
- Buyers do what with their transmission right? (use them as they are,
don't use them, use them on a different path, sell part or all of them
to someone else, reassign part or all of them to someone else, defer
them to a later time period, extend them beyond their original time
period, etc).

If these types of ""what"" questions are answered thoroughly, then the OSC
will be able to define the right architecture, communication structure,
state transitions, etc. to meet the business needs.

Patt,

I think many of your questions about Business Practice 2 could be
resolved
by including the definitions and state diagram from the OASIS 1.4 S&CP /
Order 638.  (I pulled out a copy of the definitions, but could not grab
the
diagram from the pdf file, so I attached the entire 1.4 document.  The
definitions appear on pages 26-28, and the state diagram is on page 29.)
I
also threw out my responses, for whatever they are worth, to your
questions
in the body of your email.

Mike,

Although the wording for these standards in BP 2 is taken directly out
of
Order 638, in looking at the State Diagram, it appears to me that
""SUPERSEDED"" should be included in Standards 4.6, 4.7, and 4.12 , and
that
""DECLINED"" and ""SUPERSEDED"" should be included in Standard 4.6.VI.

Is there a reason that we are trying to make this our stand-alone
document
instead of just endorsing the Standards as they appear in Order 638,
taking
exception or recommending changes where necessary?  Using Patt's email
as
an example, it seems like we are taking a big risk of missing something
if
we just take bits and pieces of a document.

Mike:

I won't be able to join the conference call on the 31st (due to being on
night shift).  I have a couple of questions on BP 2 and 3.

Regarding Business Practice #2:

1.  I don't see where there's an option to Pre-Confirm a transmission
request.

Are we still going to have this option?  Does it need to be specifically
addressed (I would think yes).  Is this supposed to be implied in
Standard
4.10?  The customer doesn't actually change the status to CONFIRMED, but
maybe it's just semantics (as in, if there computer is doing the CONFIRM
behind the scenes, and not actually changing the status manually)?



** Preconfirmed is not mentioned because it does not effect the timing
requirements.  When the tag is submitted, it is QUEUED and then must be
acted on by the TP within the specified time frame.  All preconfirmed
does
is remove the obligation of the PSE to respond after the TP ACCEPTS the
request, since preconfirmed automatically takes it to CONFIRMED.,


2.  In Standard 4.6, there is a state of INVALID.  But this is never
described, and there doesn't seem to be any further reference to it.
Should we describe what would be designated as INVALID?  What is
supposed
to happen when the request is in this state?  Should there be a
statement
included, such as if a request is found to be INVALID, the only way to
have
further consideration given to the request is by submitting a new, valid
request?


** Per the definition, INVALID is a Final State for the Request.


3.  What is the distinction between DECLINED and REFUSED?  Should this
distinction be included in this document?  Is DECLINED a refusal of a
REBID
(as implied in Standard 4.12)?


** See Definitions.  Refused is for lack of ATC, Declined says TP does
not
accept your terms.


4.  Depending on the answer to #3, shouldn't Standard 4.7 include
DECLINED?
In addition to ACCEPTED, COUNTEROFFER, and REFUSED?

**  No. The TP can DECLINE a request because the price is incorrect,
whether or not there is ATC available.

5.  In Standard 4.9, it talks about RECEIVED.  But RECEIVED isn't
mentioned
anywhere else.  How does the request get to the RECEIVED state?  And
what
happens to it from there?  And how is it different from QUEUED?

** RECEIVED is a ""placeholder"" state that simply means the TP has
received
the request.  The paths from Queued and Received are identical.

6.  Standard 4.11 says that the TP can move the request to RETRACTED.
Shouldn't this be included in Standard 4.6?

** RETRACTED should not be included in 4.6 because you cannot go from
QUEUED to RETRACTED

7.  Again depending on the answer to #3, should REFUSED be included in
Standard 4.12?  In addition to DECLINED, ACCEPTED and COUNTEROFFER?

** Again the answer is NO because you cannot go from REBID to REFUSED.
HOWEVER, SUPERSEDED should be included in this list.

Regarding Business Practice #3:

Under Detailed Practice, Reassignment:

I'm not sure that I understand the distinction between ""all rights"" and
""rollover rights"".  Or, wouldn't ""all rights"" include rollover rights?

1.  It states in the first paragraph that, by default, rollover rights
remain with the original rights owner.  This seems to contradict the
rest
of the paragraph, which states that the original transmission purchaser
is
removed from all obligations, and that all rights transfer to the
secondary
purchaser.  Wouldn't that include the rollover rights?  Should the
statements say ""with all rights and obligations, with the possible
exception of rollover rights, transferring to the secondary transmission
rights owner""?

2.  The first paragraph states that rollover rights can be transferred
by
explicit contractual determination.  How would this be conveyed to the
TSP?
Will the manner of communication be standardized (such as including it
in
the notification of reassignment of transmission rights)?


Thanks for the clarifications.

All,

  This serves as the announcement for the 1st in a series of Business
Practice Conference Calls.  I've setup this 1st call to discuss BP 2 and
BP 3, as I received no additional comments on the order or grouping for
discussing the BPs.

  Attached is the information for the call, as well as the current
outstanding items from the task list.  So that you have time to review
and comment on these particular BPs I've moved this call until Thursday
the 31th.   Please use the ""BP Conf Call One BP2 and BP3.doc"" to submit
your comments, and direct your comments to the 5 specifice areas of the
BP (i.e. Practice Summary, Associated Rules, Justification,
Applicability, Practice Details).  I will send out any updates that I
receive prior to the call.

Mike

"RE: URGENT!!!  UBS SCHEDULERS WILL NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO EPMI FILES ON MONDAY, FEB 4!!!!","Lloyd / Corry,
 
Do you folks know what is driving the cutover for Monday morning rather than Wednesday evening as planned?  We have been planning on being ready for Wednesday morning and Monday will cause some unnecessary grief.
 
Bill,
 
Can you work with Erik and Dean in Houston and Cara and Mike in Portland to ensure that they have the required logins to estate systems to schedule next week.
 
Thanks,
 
Tom.

I will see what I can do about the cut-over.  Until the email this morning, I had been told that we had until Thursday morning.  The contingency plan in the east is to have Corry's folks come down and help the estate staff using estate logins.  Is this possible for you folks as well.

Why has this now changed to Monday from Thursday morning and who made this decision?
 
Will we be able to schedule Monday without the UBS folks?

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"RE: Power Trading Systems Weekly Update","
Cara, Yes, primarily due to some additional requests that Corry has surfaced during user acceptance testing.  (I copied Corry on this in case you want to discuss with him)  He is looking for a number of excel type features that are not part of Will's grid object.  Will is doing some additional research for me on this...

Give me a call if you want to discuss.  As always, thanks for your interest and engagement.

"RE: ISAS Meeting Agenda 2/14&15/2002","Ray and ISAS -

Just going through the past four days of email, so please excuse this
response if it has been already addressed.

What was said at the Jan 17th meeting of the ESWG was, I (Bob Harshbarger)
was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting, membership, etc.
at that meeting.  

ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as
quickly as the ESC.  The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint
Guidance Committee.  We have been asked to consider formalized or structure
membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given.  The
intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a
timely manner.

There is no perfect solution.  A weighted sector voting structure does
appear to give broader voice to the masses, yet even within a single sector
the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented.
What the ESWG adopts is to be seen.

Good Morning Fellas,

In anticipation of the next testing opportunity,  I am going to use June 20th as my target date.  Can you please clear out the routes for that date at all West Points, I am going to evaluate more complicated routing and pathing next.

I will wait to test until given the go-ahead by you.

"Fw: Message from Marine Recon in Afganistan"," 
----- Original Message ----- 
From: Jon & Amanda Morsics <mailto:surfgator@ev1.net> 
To: Pat Kennedy <mailto:ReefRashMan@houston.rr.com> 
Sent: Saturday, January 19, 2002 8:49 PM
Subject: Fw: Message from Marine Recon in Afganistan

Thought you might find this interesting ... got it from a friend at work. 

 The following was read on the Sully and Scooter (Radio KOGO in San 
 Diego) Show on Nov. 17: 

    Just outside of Ab Gach, in the northwest panhandle of Afghanistan 
 between Tajikstan and Pakistan, November 11, 2001. 

    Bizarre, It's (expletive) freezing here. I'm sitting on hard, cold 
 dirt between rocks and shrubs at the base of the Hindu Kush mountains along 
 the Dar 'yoi Pomir River watching a hole that leads to a tunnel that leads 
 to a cave. Stake out, my friend, and no pizza delivery for thousands of 
 miles. 
      
    I also glance at the area around my ass every ten to fifteen seconds 
 to avoid another scorpion sting. I've actually given up battling the 
 chiggers and sand fleas, but them (expletive) scorpions give a jolt like a 
 cattle prod. Hurts like a bastard. The antidote tastes like transmission 
 fluid but God bless the Marine Corps for the five vials of it in my pack. 

    The one truth the Taliban cannot escape is that, believe it or not, 
 they are human beings, which means they have to eat food and drink water. 
 That requires couriers and that's where an old bounty hunter like me comes 
 in handy. I track the couriers, locate the tunnel entrances and storage 
 facilities, type the info into the handheld, shoot the coordinates up to the 
 satellite link that tells the air commanders where to drop the hardware, we 
 bash some heads for a while, then I track and record the new movement. It's 
 all about intelligence. 

    We haven't even brought in the snipers yet. These scurrying rats 
 have no idea what they're in for. We are but days away from cutting off 
 supply lines and allowing the eradication to begin. I dream of bin Laden 
 waking up to find me 
    standing over him with my boot on his throat as I spit a bloody ear 
 into his face and plunge my nickel plated Bowie knife through his frontal 
 lobe. But you know me. I'm a romantic. 

    I've said it before and Ill say it again: This country blows, man. 
 It's not even a country. There are no roads, there's no infrastructure, 
 there's no government. This is an inhospitable, rockpit (expletive) ruled by 
 eleventh century warring tribes.  There are no jobs here like we know jobs. 
 Afghanistan offers two ways for a man to support his family: join the opium 
 trade or join the army. That's it. Those are your options. Oh, I forgot, you 
 can also live in a refugee camp and eat plum-sweetened, crushed beetle paste 
 and squirt mud like a goose with stomach flu if that's your idea of a party. 
 But the smell alone of those ""tent cities of the walking dead"" is enough to 
 hurl you into the poppy fields to cheerfully scrape bulbs for eighteen hours 
 a day. 

    And let me tell you something else. I've been living with these 
 Tajiks and Uzbeks and Turkmen and even a couple of Pushtins for over a month 
 and a half now and this much I can say for sure: These guys, all of em, are 
 Huns. Actual, living Huns. They LIVE to fight. Its what they do. Its ALL 
 they do. They have no  respect for anything, not for their families or for 
 each other or for themselves. They claw at one another as a way of life. 
 They play polo with dead calves and force their five-year-old sons into 
 human cockfights to defend the family honor. Huns, roaming packs of savage, 
 heartless beasts who feed on each other's barbarism. (Expletive) cavemen 
 with AK 47's. 
       
    Then again, maybe I'm just cranky. I'm freezing my (expletive) off 
 on this stupid (expletive) hill because my lap warmer is running out of 
 juice and I can't recharge it until the sun comes up in a few hours. Oh 
 yeah! You like to write letters, right? Do me a favor, Bizarre. Write a 
 letter to CNN and tell Judy and Bernie and that awful, sneering, pompous 
 Aaron Brown to stop calling the Taliban ""smart."" They are not smart. I 
 suggest CNN invest in a dictionary because the word they are looking for is 
 ""cunning."" The Taliban are cunning, like jackals and hyenas and wolverines. 
 They are sneaky and ruthless and, when confronted, cowardly. They are 
 hateful, malevolent parasites who create nothing and destroy everything 
 else. Smart. Pfft. Yeah, they're real smart. They've spent their entire 
 lives reading only one book (and not a very good one, as books go) and 
 consider hygiene and indoor plumbing to be products of the devil. They're 
 still figuring out how to work a Bic lighter. Talking to a Taliban warrior 
 about improving his quality of life is like trying to teach an ape how to 
 hold a pen; eventually he just gets frustrated and sticks you in the eye 
 with it. OK, enough. 
      
    Snuffle will be up soon so I have to get back to my hole. Covering 
 my tracks in the snow takes a lot of practice but I'm getting good at it. 
 Please tell my fellow Americans to turn off their TV sets and move on with 
 their lives. The story line you are getting from CNN is utter (expletive) 
 and designed not to deliver truth but rather to keep you glued to the screen 
 through the commercials. We've got this one under control. The worst thing 
 you guys can do right now is sit around analyzing what we're doing over here 
 because you have no idea what we're doing and, really, you don't want to 
 know. We are your military and we are doing what you sent us here to do. 
    You wanna help? Buy some (expletive) stocks, America. 
    Saucy Jack

I have temporarily granted you special permission for Path Confirmation until the new launchpad released.

Good Morning, 

Here is the spreadsheet that you sent out with the access for the West Power Scheduling group. The users are now only me, Diane Cutsforth, and Donald Robinson.



 << File: EnPower Roles.xls >> 

I dont' know if you are aware, but we are having problems with accessing both PreSchedule Workspace and Path Confirmation. Donald Robinson and Diane Cutsforth have more details than I do, as I have been out on medical leave for a month.

Donald tried to login this morning and had problems, If you are aware of this bug let me know, if you need more details, please speak to him.

His number is 503/464-3902

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

	You are correct, if run with the params you supplied there are no results.. I did go ahead and check the option to 'Include Cross Portfolio Deals' and deals did then show up.. please do try it with that option checked and let me know.

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path Confirmation done on 8/23

Good Evening,

I wanted to poke around a bit and see if I could find anything quickly so you all could proceed.

Path Confirmation:

I like the new way the confirm box pops up.  

Path Cut,

I tried to cut a path for 6/21, got through all the usual screens, and added my info,  I got the following error:

""Cannot be updated. Key Violation. ORA-00001: unique constraint (PWR.PK_SCHD_PATH_CUTS) violated""  no cut information was saved.


I still cannot get anything to show up in scheduling.  I tried West Wing for 6/21,  PV for 6/22, and Mid C for 6/23. The software says it is loading deals, but no results are showing in the filter or the schedule screen.
I have to be able to really test the routing, so  we need to get this resolved.  Most of the routing looked ok, except the deals changed in scheduling would not route and the Physical vs Non-physical flag was not being triggered properly. Because our physical and non-physical volumes are tracked through Enpower and recorded for the WSCC and NERC fees that we pay, this information needs to be correct.


I will stay late, come in early, or whatever it takes to get things tested.  


Thanks,

Cara

"RE: A couple a questions","I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see who does it first!).

Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will give you a call to fax.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)

"RE: Testing June 22","Cara,
I was out Friday, but totally agree on segregation of East and West Confirmations.  Also, I agree that there needs to be a method to delete confirmation records (either for mistakes on date, path changes requiring it, etc).  I didn't get any records to go to the confirmation table on Thursday, so I'll look at the information on the transmission cells uploaded today.

I don't think repeating some of the errors we find is too big of a problem.

Good Afternoon Everyone


PreSchedule Workspace:

I started uploading schedules last evening from the PSW to the Path Confirm Dbase.  The COB sheet took 1 hour and 12 minutes to run 40 lines, still around 2 minutes per line.  This is an improvement, still slow for usefulness in production.

I experimented with putting the transmission in the E column, to see if it will represent in the path or if it will blow up the app. The result of that was that it ran the lines and totally ignored anything extra in the E cell. 



Path Confirmation:

We will need to automatically make sure that only East users see East Schedules and West users see West Schedules.  I cannot comprehend the nightmare of problems we will run into if we are not completely segregated.

If I run lines into the wrong date, or for some other reason need to delete entire records, how do I do that? I assure you this will happen.

*Something seems to have changed in the transmission cell uploading, Any information I put in the first set of Transmission cells is ignored. (Trans1 Name, Trans1 deal, Trans 1 oasis).


That's all I am going to do for now,  we can pick things up again on Monday.  Do you think it would be good to do a quick rundown of what has been identified and what has been corrected ? I am worried that my testing might have to be repeated on some of the same items due to the volume of e-mails.

Thanks,

Cara

Could Enron's Business Model Actually Work?

January 28, 2002 

By DANIEL ALTMAN


 

Is Enron (news/quote)'s business model still a good one?
With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away,
the answer may be yes. Despite Enron's collapse, its goal
of merging the best thinking in energy, finance and
information technology as an online commodity trader still
garners respect. 

""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basic
virtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chief
executive and research director of the META Group
(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""There
is still a real market for virtual trading companies, no
question about it."" 

Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,
later, other products like rights to high-speed
telecommunications networks and financial hedges against
changes in the weather. It used a sophisticated online
platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the
company's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst who
follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the company
had ""the pioneering online venture for real-time
availability of information"" used in trading commodities. 

*  
Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yet
serve as a model for other companies. In the wake of
Enron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support for
that model model came from its competitors. 

Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companies
that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for
electricity and natural gas. 

""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron
went away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief
operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant. 

""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayed
basically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of one
intermediary just proves that these competitive markets
work."" 

Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill
the gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked up
market share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,
that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremely
important and a big income earner for us, is not the
centerpiece of our business."" 

Another company that sees continued value in the Enron
approach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, which
bought Enron's electricity and gas trading business in
bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its
own brand. 

""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" David
Walker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-rate
trading platform."" 

Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivatives
business and Enron's trading of energy contracts were one
factor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""The
characteristics of trading these types of products and
betting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,
are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors."" 

Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had
""outstanding"" information technology organization that was
backed by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way as
well, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to the
best financial companies out there."" 

Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnick
predicted, UBS would have little difficulty regaining
Enron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that it
shouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a couple
seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market
inefficiency, obviously you're going to make money."" 

According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field
of finance, the company did not necessarily come up with a
lot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizing
existing ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods. 

""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the
context of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, a
professor of finance at the University of Texas who once
consulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they were
doing."" 

Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,
advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.
He said the company needed advanced financial tools to
price its derivatives, which specified energy products to
be delivered at various times and sites while demand was
uncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probably
breaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" he
said. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe and
may be hard to do."" 

Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business School
who studied Enron, said the company had been using what
would be considered ""best practices"" for using derivatives
by any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's. 

Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, it
might still survive today. 

""Enron could have done extremely well with betting on
market inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""People
stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own
theories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when it
could no longer cover the ever-higher risks it began
taking. 

Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, by
throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash
flow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on its
network capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which never
turned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,
financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demise
like a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts of
this story."" 

But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online trading
system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might
not rule out future, similar endeavors. 

""In any commodity, there are always people who have too
much and others who have too little, so there's always
going to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""
Professor Tufano said. 

Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simply
ill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" he
said. He noted that the deregulation of electricity and
natural gas led to a long period during which the market
for energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It does
take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable
with the idea that they should risk-manage and out-source
their use of that commodity.""

Subject:	Test Results for June 23rd 

Good Afternoon

I ran only the Mid Columbia Sheet data for June 23rd.  Here are my findings:

PreSchedule Workspace:

I was forced to choose East or West:  good.

The error-check feature found the following problems:
	Incorrectly spelled Counterparty short names
	Missing Sched term 
	Missing Border 1 
	Missing Sched Hour 
	Missing Supply or Market Price
	Missing Supply or Market  Cont. Term
	Missing Time Zone
	Missing Supply  or Market MW


Error Check did not see the following errors:
	Missing Supply OR Market deal numbers
	Missing Physical or Non-Physical designation

During my work, I exited once and decided not to save changes in my MidC sheet.  When i re-opened, there was no data on the sheet at all. I re-pasted my sheet data in, but when I tried to execute the build-route query, I got an error message saying ""List index out of bounds (2)"". When I resaved my data, closed and re-opened, my data was there, but when I tried to query build route again, I got the error message ""List index out of bounds (3)"". 

The confirm seemed to run very quickly, but I found no data populated in the June 23rd date of Path confirmation.

Routing took 13 minutes to run, acceptable speed for the amount of paths (all daily and all monthly for MidC). QUESTION:  Can we just route the month long bookouts on the first, with the designation of Month in the sched term like we can now?  It will cut down on the daily routing.


Path Confirmation:

Not forced to choose East or West on this:

Unable to test this with the new data as none was displayed.  I will test as soon as I get word that I can.

Please let me know what you find, here is the sheet that I ran.

"RE: ESC conference calls to discuss individual Business Practices","John, I appreciate your giving the sublists a once-over.  I'll reply to
your comments in the order you wrote them.

BP 4 says, in essence, ""Before you sell a transmission right, make sure
your grid can support it.""  The gist of BP 9 is: ""If your Transmission
Customer wants to move energy someplace not mentioned in the purchased
transmission right, but you can still fit it in, then let it flow
anyway.""  At the ESC meeting, I was looking past the linkage statement
about these two BPs, instead focusing on the fact that BP 4 is really an
""OASIS"" practice while BP 9 is about energy scheduling.  Now, though, in
the tranquility of my office, I'm inclined to agree that they should
still be considered together.  Both of these BPs give you a choice
between path and flowgate models (and the more granular the flowgate
model, the closer you get to a purely financial transmission market), so
how would you feel about calling both of them ""model-independent""?

BP 25 discusses fragmentary scheduling (i.e., letting a group of
entities in the transaction chain submit pieces of a schedule which,
when pieced together, form a complete and continuous schedule).  As
written, the BP doesn't seem to tie us to any particular transmission
model, because the fragments could conceivably use any combination of
physical and financial transmission rights.  So this BP would appear to
belong in the ""model independent"" category.

We in the West have suggested a rewording of BP 1, 10 and 12 (hopefully,
soon to be shared with the ESC) to allow regions like ours to minimize
the operational impact of changing the frequency and duration of
non-emergency generator ramping.  As drafted, these changes would have
no effect on current practices in the East, so more than one version of
each BP would be unnecessary.

The ""Applicability"" section of BP 24 reads, in part: ""This Business
Practice addresses the implementation of a curtailment/reload by (a
Scheduling Authority).  It does not address the  process items leading
up to the curtailment ...""  I would say that BP 24 does not depend on
the choice of congestion management method selected.

By the way, I'm sharing these comments with ESC Business Practice Task
Force Chair Mike McElhany, who is apportioning the BP discussions among
a series of conference calls to begin as early as January 30.

Thank you, John, for your valuable input.

John, just a couple of quick comments. 

First BP 9 is identified as an ""independent issue"" and BP 4 is
identified as
a ""dependent Issues"", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I would
think
both of these should be ""dependent"",  unless I am missing something.  I
guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is asking to
be
worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West and East
proposal for each of these practices?  

Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common (nationwide)
Congestion Management scheme, or is this BP totally unrelated or
insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme (physical or
financial)?


Thanks John,

Will,

I really don't want it to say Mid Columbia,  Up here MidColumbia is just one Delivery point, but the Mid Columbia Region contains many more points than that.  I will be confusing to real time.  Please just make it say Northwest.

Are the other regions ok?   If the regions have to be NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26  and then Northwest, WSCC-S, WSCC-N, and Rockies,  that would be liveable to me.

Cara,

We store the region from the path cuts in the database as a single EnPower Region.  That means that we can only map California to one of R10, R11, and R12.  Are you intending the regions within Path Confirmation to represent a group of EnPower Regions?  If so, we will need to make a database change to store those groupings.  I expect that the database change would take a long time because it will involve a Global database change.

Thanks,
Will

Good Afternoon,

I do want the regions to understand Enpower Regions, but at the same time not be so specific to the user.  Here is the breakdown that I would want:

California = R10, R11, and R12

Northwest = R9
	Enpower calls it MidColumbia, but many more delivery points than Just Mid Columbia are contained within it, and I don't want to list them all in the region choice or 	confuse the useres further by them looking for something in the northwest that is not MidColumbia.

WSCC-S=R7

Rockies = R7A

WSCC-N=R8

Please also see my notes below on the existing system. I am happy to provide any further explanation you would like.

Subject:	RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Cara,

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility) This is why I want preset regions, right now they are user defined and a mess
Date
Path
Cuts

I think the best way is to have the sort selection as it is in the new system, by date primarily, and then the nifty sort tool you all have written

Is the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?  Yes

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Good Afternoon,

Here are my findings for the latest Release of the PSW and Path Conf. I am re-running the date of June 22, as I see no data in the path confirmation for that date.

PreSchedule Workspace:

I tried to open the sheet ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  and got this error ""Access violation at address 00000016. Read of address 00000016.  I could not save, close or do anything, I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW.  I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet, and had closed the COB sheet. When I re-opened the ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  sheet, it was completely blank.  This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet. 

Error checking
The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal (#657854.1) that was put in the market deal number area. It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buy/resale.  This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present, but the routing error check mentioned it in rows 69-192, where the deal number was not present. Can the sheet be made to understand that a buy/resale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell?

I also got just ""Error:"" with no explanation of what the error was for rows 3-6, 9-11 and 21-28.  Rows 3-6  and 9-11, has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream, both identified as Portland General System on the sheet. Rows 21-28 I see no errors apparent. 

My second PV sheet gave me  routing error  ""Error:""  with no explanation on rows 2-45.  The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export.  I changed all rows to X, and still got the routing error with no explanation.  I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection. Could it be that the system already detects routes?

 << File: PV_JUNE22_LIMITED.psc >> 



Path Confirmation:

The Transmission information seems to be populating correctly, all trans looks good and has the -E- on each side. I can put my POR/POD info in the Oasis cell, and all the info looks great!
The Global ID Sorting is working just right.
The Tag Sorting is also working just right.
The expanded view is showing the entire path regardless of length.
I like the POR and POD sort capability, this will be very helpful.

In the Expanded View,  even though I know the counterparty, this view sometimes shows me a blank drop down box where the counterparty should be. Allegheney did not show a counterparty name here. This actually looks like it might be specific to Allegheney.

In the line view My counterparty on the sheet CPS shows Constellation Power Source, Inc.  but in the expanded view I see City Public Service of San Antonio. They both have CPS as their short name, but the second counterparty is an East Desk Counterparty. Corry, Can you get their short name changed to something else you like?

Path Cut:

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for.  I only want to see the following:  California   Northwest   WSCC-N   WSCC-S  Rockies.  If I need to provide more explanation on this, I am happy to do so. The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete, and will be cumbersome for real-time and settlements to use.  These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done.

Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done, just over a minute. Users will percieve this as something broken.

I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut, I will hand this off to them very soon.  



Overall Findings:

I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production.  We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue, but the functionality looks really good.  My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from ""X"" date previous the records are in lotus, and from ""X"" date forward they are in the new system. Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both.

Please let me know anything else that I need to do, and when I may test again.  Thanks

"RE: Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and Path Cut software","Cara,

First of all, thanks for your input.  

Regarding the new issues with path confirmation, most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily.  Vish is already working on them.  
Concerning the colors, there are three sets of colors representing market, supply and transmission.  I have asked Vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking.  This information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the application.

Regarding Pre-Schedule, adding print capability to the error log should be no problem.  Also, adding ""check for errors"" functionality will be done.  
Concerning ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points""; I believe this is raised when there are multiple strips (either term or schedule) for a deal, but the strips have different delivery points.  The routing process is not able to determine which strips to use.  I will confirm this.

We have already changed Path Confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name.  I may have both the code and description displayed.  I believe Corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records (Corry, can you confirm this?).

The information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days, but if you have more, please send it.

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Continuing testing of Preschedule Workspace, Path Confirmation and Path Cut software

I am working in the target date of June 20th.  Today I added schedules from Palo Verde and the entire MidC sheet to the testing group. Once COB is added, we will have pretty much an average daily volume.

Here is my attached worksheet for Mid C    << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >> 


In Preschedule Workspace:

I added Palo Verde to the group of deals imported, and ran a total of 37 lines into the Path confirmation. The rest of the sheet was all bookouts, and so I marked them for routing only.  I do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation. This will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for Real Time and Settlements.

I would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up, as the lists can be long, and I have to make notes on what is wrong. Also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time.  We currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths. This would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet, instead of cleaning up afterwards.

Routing functionality question:  If we change a delivery point in scheduling (BPA NW delivered gets moved and changed every day), do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point?  These types of deals route now, I would like to duplicate that existing functionality. I did get an error message on those lines, ""Capability not supported: deal has multiple delivery points"" Please see the attached sheet, there is a batch of them line 76 thru 86, but it is all deals that are our BPA Northwest Delivered.

The routing speed is EXCELLENT. One second per line or less all the way in Portland on Local Enpower! The megawatts also appear to split properly between mis-matched deal amounts! this is very encouraging. My Palo data was corrupted, so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery points.

My plan is to attack the Alias stuff from a different angle. We are going to work with the team that sets the Enpower ""short name"" to something that is workable.  I would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that Enpower short name. 



In Path Confirmation

The early sorting looks good, things look very versatile and useable. 

Yesterday I identified several problems:

1. The entire path needs to be shown in Both counterparty paths. Currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp.

2. The Alias list is not functioning properly.  The Enpower Long name needs to be shown in the Collapsed counterparty view, along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp.

3. Confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch, not pulling up each deal line by line.


Today, I am finding the following:

1.  When a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view,  the system blows away the schedule term and the Delivery point.  These fields have to be re-populated before saving can occur.

2.I am not allowed to sort by Global ID,  even though global IDs are populated there. My idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section, no globals go in another section, and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers. (just like the phys vs. non phys).

3. Pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over 2 minutes.  This is to long to be practical in production for real time. I would like to see this time go to 5 seconds or less.

4.  All paths are showing up as being cut (cut checkbox checked), even though none have been cut yet.

5. The grey on grey color scheme is not going to work, but that is a little thing. Lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable. Variations of the beige color are easier to read.

6. The path cut button and dialog boxes I think are going to need alot of work.  It looks like I will have to do all the Enpower work first, and then populate the cut. This is a bit different than we discussed.  My plan is to take this as far as I can, and then hand it over to Bill Williams III and his group for final 'tweaking'.

7. I also cannot sort by tag number.  We need that.



Thank you all for your work on this, it is really looking good. 
I have to schedule on Monday, but will jump right back in when I am finished with daily tasks.

I agree with Corry's requirements, it is one of the most important defenses we have against human error.  We can always refer back to the build route report.

Can you unroute June 18th in TestP Sched so I can test routing again?  I don't want to do the same day over and over again, so we can compare. 

Thanks,

Cara,

I fixed the locking problem on the Build Route sheet.  Corry had asked that the application not allow anyone from deleting data from the build route grid.  This is to protect against deals being pulled in a second time and being accidentally duplicated in the workspace.  

Corry,

I know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  I haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.

With kind regards,
Will

"RE: Continued Testing-June 21 target Date","Cara,
I pulled several comments you made out, and dittos from here.

I agree with your following statements:

	Even though this path could be consolidated to be smaller, we have many paths that are a good deal longer.  The part of the path in blue is in the 	upstream cell and seems to be the holdup. The size limit of the path needs to be considerably larger, or we need a way to override that for exceptionally 	long paths. I made the path smaller and got the same error.

I notice that when we have values in the transmission cells, the big E is not on there. Enron needs to be shown as ""bookends"" on the transmission we use, or else it could be misconstrued as a purchase or sale.

Some really long paths might show better in line view if that could auto-size vertically

When I try to cut a particlar path, the action of the entire Path Cut screen coming up and then me having to choose New Path cut totally blocks my view of the existing path I am trying to deal with. I think instead this should pop up as an addition to the expanded view of the existing deal. I should be able to cut a path without having to deal with the whole sort menu.


I absolutely agree with the following:
	Region should be a button list that is driven only by the East or West designation of the person's Enpower Login.  As a West User, I should only get 5 choices for 	Region: WSCC-N, WSCC-S, Rockies, MidC, or California. The drop down list is time consuming,  confusing and can lead to too many errors.

	Reason Text-this is not spelled correctly,  and the text box could be much smaller.  Most Reasons are probably a sentence at most.

The problem continues,  I could pull up the schedules in Scheduling, but they are all routed, so I rescheduled the entire day of June 15, which is the day I will test, and when I did,  I queried scheduling for the 15th, and when the schedules came up they show no mw's but do show a route, but only for the 16th.

I don't know why that is happening. I am trying to get my sheet re-set up for the 16th of june, to try all over again.

Can you see if you all can get me clean unrouted Palo Verde data for June 16th???

"Standards Announcement -- Phase IIB, IIA (2 Standards), and Definitions of Terms","TO:  STANDARDS LIST SERVER GROUP
       NERC ROSTER

Ladies and Gentlemen:

PHASE IIB AND IIA (2 STANDARDS) STANDARDS, AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS

On February 20, 2002, the NERC Board of Trustees will consider the following Planning Standards and definitions of terms as used in the Planning Standards for approval. This posting is the 30-day (actually 26-day) notification prior to the Board's vote.

A.  Phase IIB Planning Standards (TTC and ATC)

The Phase IIB Standards (TTC and ATC) were approved by the Market Interface Committee at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting and by the Planning Committee by mail ballot on January 23, 2002. They include one Standard and three measurements and compliance templates as follows:  I.E.1 S1, M1, M3-M4 - Transfer Capabilities (TTC and ATC). They can be viewed or downloaded from the NERC web site.

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#PhIIB_TTCATC


B.  Phase IIB Planning Standards (CBM and TRM)

The Phase IIB Standards (CBM and TRM) were approved by the Market Interface Committee at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting and by the Planning Committee by mail ballot on January 23, 2002. They include two Standards and six measurements and compliance templates as follows:  I.E.2 S1-S2, M1, M3-M6, M8 - Transfer Capabilities (CBM and TRM). They can be viewed or downloaded from the NERC web site:

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#PhIIB_CBMTRM

C.  Phase IIA Planning Standards (Two reconsidered Standards)

The Planning Committee approved the Phase IIA (two reconsidered) Standards at its November 19-20, 2001 meeting. The Market Interface Committee also approved these Standards at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting.

These Phase IIA Planning Standards include two Standards and three associated measurements and compliance templates:

I.A. S3, M3 - Transmission Systems
III.A. S3, M3 and M5 - Transmission Protection Systems

These Standards can be viewed or downloaded from the NERC web site:

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#PhIIA_IAIIIA

D.  Definitions of Terms as Used in the Planning Standards

The Market Interface Committee approved 17 definitions of terms used in the Planning Standards at its January 10-11, 2002 meeting. It also chose to remove five proposed definitions that it believed to be unclear, circular, or inconsistent with terms in other glossaries. These five terms are:

1. Entities Responsible for the Reliability of the Interconnected Transmission System
2. Local Network
3. Regional Process
4. Radial Customer
5. User of the Interconnected Electric Systems

The Planning Committee approved the complete list of terms and their definitions by mail ballot on January 23, 2002.

These definitions and terms as used in the Planning Standards can be viewed and downloaded from the NERC web site:

http://www.nerc.com/~pc/standards/#definitions


Next Steps

If approved by the NERC Board, these Planning Standards will be the last groupings of Planning Standards that will have completed the 1997 NERC Standards Development Process, including field testing, and a re-review through the 1997 NERC Standards Development Process. Following Board approval, these Planning Standards will be available for formal implementation of reviews for compliance under the NERC Compliance Program. No further Planning Standards will be developed and approved under NERC's 1997 Standards process.

The Standards, if approved by the Board, will remain in effect until they are replaced by NERC Organization Standards.

Sincerely,

Angie Nicastro
Secretary-Engineering

Subject:	RE: Outstanding Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation

Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report.

Path Confirmation Report:
Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Fixed Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Fixed  Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. 
Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be an error-checking point? 
Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   
Fixed Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserved from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling. 
Fixed, Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Fixed  For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Fixed Transmission should be optional (Confirm with Cara)
Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Added Copy Path Cut Button, it stores all selected path_cut ino, change the required hour and save it.   Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. 
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. 
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a ""Go to Cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will

I have been told today that these folks will have to do all of our scheduling as of Monday, they are being trained today but will have to have working logins patterned after Donald Robinson by the end of business today.

Serena Bishop ( I do not know what she has access to, she was the California scheduler)
Mike Purcell (already has access to some things, but please check his access)

If this cannot be done, please call Murray O'Neil asap.  His Cell is 503-702-9846

"RE: California Regions","Cara,
	Looking into the Physical and Bookout summary reports, upon recreating the functionality there are certain sections to the report which we aren't clear on.. we are still needing to know which delivery points to map the following summary sections to:

	COB
	PV 		[Currently mapped to PALO VERDE]
	MIDC 		[Currently mapped to MID COLUMBIA]
	NWMISC
	SWMISC
	California	[Currently mapped to  NP-15, SP15 and ZP26]


	We've recreated the reporting functionality [excel based]  from within our new application.. and upon obtaining these mappings we can push this out to production for ya'll  asap.  If you'd like to have the summary report information dumped into the 'Aggregate Schedule Volume Report' we can definitely do that; but, would require us more time to get that functionality to you. 

thanks

 The ""California"" region choice will be a combination of R10-R11and R12. (NP-15, SP15, and ZP26 respectively)  

I do not know the desks that control anything on the list below, those all look just like emissions credit desks, which would not be handled by anyone here.

West Power is as Follows
California (as defined above) - EPMI ST-Cali and EPMI LT-Cali
WSCC-S and Rockies:  EPMI ST-SW and EPMI LT-SW
WSCC-N and Northwest: EPMI ST-NW and EPMI LT-NW.

Please note:  Any desk here can trade any point, so even though the STSW has primary control over the daily trades, the body of trades will have probably all desks represented in it.

Subject:	RE: Outstanding Issues with Pre-Schedule and Path Confirmation

Please see my comments in blue

What follows are known issues with the Path Confirmation Report.

Path Confirmation Report:
Fixed Need to enable text wrapping for Path field.  The Path field is the most important field of which to see all data. Right now some paths are wrapped, and some aren't.   
Fixed Can we add a ""master-detail"" setup when soring by Tag.  Provide a list of tags and show data for selected Tag.
Fixed  Sorting by Global ID - This needs to be able to be done in the upper Sort area.  This is unclear.  What is meant by the upper Sort area? The area where we can drag and shuffle sort criteria, up above the regular line view. 
Fixed Not able to see the entire path in the ""expanded view"".  Also, delivery points are not showing up. Yesterday, I found that if a delivery point on the sheet is not exactly what Enpower has (ie: Midway instead of Midway-PSC), the expanded view just gets rid of it completely. Perhaps this should be an error-checking point? 
Done Find out to what the greyed out name in the expanded view is related. Just getting rid of that unrelated name is enough.   
Fixed Extend the size limit of the path.
We need to find out if the existing data was blown away purposefully or if this was accidental. In the last release, only the data from 6/23 was preserved from the previous version.
The POR/POD fields are still the same. We would like the delivery point selection to mimic the same functionality as the delivery point selection we see in Scheduling. 
Fixed, Press Enter or Seelct the date from the drop down Pulling up the proper date with the calendar is slow when there is data populated into the system. We need to make sure that the selection process does not get incrementally slower with each additional day of data that is added.
Fixed  For some reason, a gobal ID is showing up in the expanded view in lines where there is not a Global ID provided. It is always the same one: CISO_EPMI_5001.

Path Cuts:
Need to filter Region list for cuts by trading desk (East or West).
Allow hour ranges in the Hour # field specifically in HE 0000 (military) format (e.g.  0200-0400 or 1000-1400).
Must allow string values to be stored in the annuity field.
Fixed Transmission should be optional (Confirm with Cara)
Fixed Make it easier to show all cuts for a path.
Added Copy Path Cut Button, it stores all selected path_cut ino, change the required hour and save it.   Allow incremental hours to a cut, as hourly cuts can go on for several hours but one hour at a time. A new tag might have to be made each hour of the cut.  I'm not quite sure what you are asking for.  Can you give a little more detail? If I create a cut for a single hour, I would like to show additional hours in the same cut at a later time. Kind of an 'add-on' to the original cut. 
This application will go through a final evaluation by the real time departments, and I expect that they will need features that I have not been able to anticipate. My plan is to get as many of their needs met as possible before turning testing over to them, they are aware of this and the time table that we all are trying to meet. I will also help them with their testing to articulate their needs to you in the most efficient way possible. 
In the cut view, the region is still the cumbersome drop down list. This needs to be a forced choice option, like the hour-ahead vs. real-time selection.  The choices for the west are : WSCC-S, WSCC-N, Rockies, Northwest, California. Corry will be able to provide his region choices.
Fixed The path that has been cut needs to be able to pull up the cut note without hunting for it in the Cut Path view. The suggestion of a ""Go to Cut"" button was made in an earlier e-mail.


Let me know if there is anything that I have missed.

Thanks,
Will

"RE: Status Report and Production Release Note","
	Just got done talking with Corry, and Deal Scheduling showing the incorrect status of a physical routed flag is an issue. Corry will proceed and test against pwrtestp on Monday, no production rollouts will occur at this time.  
	Since we do have a major database migration process this weekend, our DBA's are currently tied up and our requests for production updates to the database have been slightly postponed till next week.

I had no idea that Corry was requesting the move to production yet.  I feel like the communication has been very one sided FROM me lately.

Won't the lack of proper flagging of physical paths in Deal Scheduling have an impact in the East?

Cara et all ,

	Deal Scheduling is what we are currently waiting on [physical routes issue], and the fix for it will probably take a couple of days till release. 

	Corry's request to move Path Confirmation to production by Friday COB can be scheduled pending database change requests which have been requested to allow for them. Upon approval the move for Preschedule Workspace to production can be done by Friday COB also? Cara is still testing the application and we will wait for her approval ..

Addressed this issue and we have someone currently looking at this issue and will try and get this kicked out asap.

Subject:	RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation for Target date 6/20

Cara et all, 

	Following list of bug fixes are moving out to stage to address the recently reported issues: 

	New versions of both applications have been moved out to stage..


PreSchedule Workspace:
#1
Problem:
Uploading to the Path Confirm Area:*accepted Mid C-1:53   Rockies-0:22    Palo 1:11  COB 0:49 (Row 69 Generated a General SQL error message) 
This is showing Physical and non-physical right.

Solution:
Line 69 , the timezone value under column G was '6/20/2001-6/20/2001' when it should have been 'PDT' or any other valid timezone value.


#2
Problem:
Running Build Route Report:
	Criteria Selection-unable to select criteria for build route, got ""List index out of bounds (4)"" error *needs fix

Solution:
Fixed.. was losing track of which workspace was open

#3
Problem:
Daily Summary Function
*needs fix or workaround-Would not work at all, got 3 error messages. "" Unable to locate"" ""can't find last row!"", and ""Failed to export summary!"" this is going to create a csv file right to the AGG sched vol report now according to Mr. Poston, I am thrilled to hear it.

Solution:
Executive Report was just pushed to stage yesterday, the data is currently what we're focusing on with this release and will soon start shaping it to make it visualy look like the pre-existing excel-based Executive Report.

#4
Problem:
Error Checking - took 1:29, produced a line by line error sheet that is printable, *accepted
	BUT routing errors for lines 19-223 in the COB sheet produced a routing error that just states ""ERROR:"" no reason.  We need to know why an error is shown(was 	run after all routes were deleted) *needs fix

Solution:
Error Checking will not spit out any errors if there aren't any.



Path Confirmation:


#1
Problem:
One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

Solution:
Dialog box included for deletion alert confirmation purposes and button repositioned.

Routing
Mid C-13:27   Rockies-2:23   Palo 7:56  COB 5:12 the time is fine.

**needs fix**The routes are still not showing designated Physical or Non-Physical Properly. All are coming through as Non-Physical.  This is must be fixed prior to release for production as our WSCC fee pulls directly from this data in deal Scheduling.


Path Confirmation:

Speed is very much an issue here,  I had Mark Guzman sit with me while I cut a path and when I confirmed a group of paths. The confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time I entered the name and hit the ""ok"" button until the confriming was completed. This is too long, we need this to be 20-30 seconds max. Currently, this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus. Confriming 2 paths with the 20th fully populated took 1:39.

Cutting a path went fast enough until I closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report. This also took over a minute.  This is another 10 second process in lotus.

One little housekeeping thing,  can we move the delete button away from the confirm button?  Perhaps on the other side of the exit button?  This will save us mucho headaches later. OR make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion?

All of the sorting looks great, the paths are represented properly, we are very very close!


Real Time Discussion:

Where are we on this?  I heard initial rumblings, but nothing lately.

Here are the sheets that I have used to create data for 6/20

 << File: COB_JUNE20_USEME.psc >>  << File: Mid_C_June20.psc >>  << File: Palo_June20.psc >>  << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 

I can do more testing or Net meeting stuff tomorrow until about 10:30, but after that I have to be a scheduler for a couple of hours.

Thanks,

Cara

Lloyd / Corry,
 
Do you folks know what is driving the cutover for Monday morning rather than Wednesday evening as planned?  We have been planning on being ready for Wednesday morning and Monday will cause some unnecessary grief.
 
Bill,
 
Can you work with Erik and Dean in Houston and Cara and Mike in Portland to ensure that they have the required logins to estate systems to schedule next week.
 
Thanks,
 
Tom.

I will see what I can do about the cut-over.  Until the email this morning, I had been told that we had until Thursday morning.  The contingency plan in the east is to have Corry's folks come down and help the estate staff using estate logins.  Is this possible for you folks as well.

Cara,

We have recently added to Table Edit the ability to create aliases for counterparties.  Also you should be able to add extended information about each counterparty.  The tab in Table Edit is ""Counterparty Extensions"" and when you select New...

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Try creating a few aliases and see if they work.  Because the process takes so long, you might limit it to a small number of Paths.  In the meantime, we will be looking into why the process is slow.

Will

Subject:	Testing Preschedule workspace

Good Morning,

My target testing date today is June 18th,  I am running in Test P in Local Enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet the new guidelines.

The daily deals I coded X in columns J and N,  the Month long bookouts and BOM bookouts I coded R.  


What worked:

I was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact. I had previously sucessfully copied and pasted my entire sheet from EXCEL to the PSW.

I was able to run the build route report with the criteria of ""Starting On- June 18-PaloVerde-Day of week Mask Activated-Report Changes activated."" A check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from Enpower. Because I am working on closed dates, a cumulative test of this app will not be fully testable until production. We are expecting to see the same functionality as the current incarnation of Build route. The data extracted should be read only, time stamped, and when run mulitple times additional data should be shown below previously extracted data.  The improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow. (West Light Load currently does this in Start view, but not Active view)

Navigating around the scheduling sheet itself I was able to accurately execute the sort function on a single criteria at a time. Multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the PSW to acheive the same result.

Routing deals: Will had deleted all routes for June 18th, starting me with a clean slate.  I made every path be for DAY. I was unable to confirm total unrouted MWH, as the real time position manager does not seem to be functioning in TESTP. The routing appeared to take 19 minutes with the status bar showing steady progress during that time. This time is 15-17 minutes longer than current speed using the Excel Macro system we have now. The error list gave me a row by row description of what did not route, a very useful tool.  OK was visible on all rows that the PSW believed that it had routed. I had difficulty checking the routing results, as I kept getting BDE errors in Scheduling after routing had occurred (Local Enpower). Scheduling kept starting up in 1899.  I was unable to login to TestP through Terminal server 2, but was able to in Terminal Server 5. The results there were very encouraging! Most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly. The deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet. This is consistent with what I would expect. I will further evaluate routing ability with our more complicated paths later. This routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only.



Things I did not expect that I liked:

When I highlight a group of cells in Build Route, it stays highlighted when I move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.  This is very handy for double checking Build route against the scheduler's sheet.



What does not appear to be working at this time:

The physical or not physical flag of path does not seem to be showing up properly in routing.

Path Confirmation:  The running time appeared to be over one hour for one sheet, only 70 rows of the sheet being flagged for insertion into confirmation. This current speed will not be sufficient to work in production. Also, many rows that were flagged for confirmation were not imported, and I cannot find an error log to help understand why deals were not imported to path confirmation.
When the path confirmation task was finished,  the application simply froze.  The status bar was no longer visible, leading me to believe that it was done, however the app was not able to be saved or closed or examined further.


My conclusions:

The build route and routing functions work well enough to use in production, the copy-paste function works well for the West desk per our connectivity issues.

Path Confirmation is not functioning at this point, and appears to be blowing up the app. No data was visible for June 18th even after the PSW ran through its import function.


Please let me know when the issues I have named have been addressed and are ready for further testing.

Thanks

"RE: Transmission Stuff in the new system","Regardless of your ""misc mind altering"" habits, I think Will did say that they would only be able to have path modifications/cuts modified in the notes part initially.  Then (whenever the ""next"" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with Enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).

The East Group does not need to see POR/POD in the path for ""transmission.""  My intent was to put a counterparty name in the TRAN1 NAME column (example: TVA), and Enpower deal number in TRAN1 DEAL#	(example: 236891.1) if available, and Oasis number + level of reliability in TRAN1 OASIS	 
(example:  30912345 F-7).  I thought the logic for ""Tag"" and ""Oasis"" should be a combination of text and numbers. The reasoning for Border 2 was to have an additional border point to query for (in confirmation) when we move from one place to another. What if you put the borders in the Oasis column (ie: WW/MEAD 123456 F-7)? The path would be: Generation-marketer-E-TRANS(T) WW/MEAD 123456 F-7-E-marketer-Sink.

Gotta run,
CB

Good Morning,

Did you read Will's last note?  Anyway, I am wanting to do one of two things and need to know which you like better.

The name and oasis number representation for tranny is not enough info for us.  We need POR and POD information as well. So,  I need the following capability

Either  

Put the transmission path in the E cell like we do now,

or

Put more information in the Trans name  ( ie:  APS-(T)PV/WW)  and in the OASIS cell  (ie:  23055 HNF)


Do you have a preference?  

We also need to be a united front about the design and intent of the Path Cut. They are not wanting to make it work all the way. I sure don't remember the conversations being that it should be just a replacement for the notes part, but because it's enpower everything should work together.  Am I on crack?

"RE: ESC conference calls to discuss individual Business Practices","John, just a couple of quick comments. 

First BP 9 is identified as an ""independent issue"" and BP 4 is identified as
a ""dependent Issues"", yet both of these BP's work in tandem.  I would think
both of these should be ""dependent"",  unless I am missing something.  I
guess I would have the same comment for BP #25.

The last page describes BP's (1, 10, and 12) that the WSCC is asking to be
worked independently.  I am not sure what this means - a West and East
proposal for each of these practices?  

Does BP 24 (Curtailments and Reloads) assume a common (nationwide)
Congestion Management scheme, or is this BP totally unrelated or
insignificant to any Congestion Management scheme (physical or financial)?

I fixed the locking problem on the Build Route sheet.  Corry had asked that the application not allow anyone from deleting data from the build route grid.  This is to protect against deals being pulled in a second time and being accidentally duplicated in the workspace.  

Corry,

I know you asked if we could have a button to clear the build route data, so as to start from scratch.  I haven't forgotten... just haven't had a chance to implement it.

"RE: Changing short codes now to save us headaches later","Cara,
I've sure enjoyed getting you emails to will regarding the Workspace/Confirmation programs... most of your comments have been right on.  I keep having small anxiety attacks when I realize all of the tweaking we'll have for a while.

Onward through the fog.

Aquila - agree
Dukeenetra - DETM
Morgan - agree
Edison - agree
Avista - agree
The rest we don't have any contracts with as far as I know.

I'll have everyone back next week and re-do some of my testing on the workspace.

Subject:	Changing short codes now to save us headaches later

Hi Corry,

Since the new sheets are going to be a little more fussy, and the alias thing harder to fix or maintain, I would like to get the enpower short codes changed to things that are more workable and make sense.

See how these grab you:


AQUILACORP -- AQUILA (The canadian ones can stay long for differentiation)

DUKEENENTRA- DUKE (But is there another Duke that is just Duke already?)

MSCAPGP - MORGAN

EDISONMISIM - EDISON

IDACORPENE - IDACORP

PINNACLEWE - PINNACLE

AVISTAENE - AVISTA


I have a few west specific ones, but wanted to check with you for these.

Lemmie know.

Will,

Are the other regions ok?   If the regions have to be NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26  and then Northwest, WSCC-S, WSCC-N, and Rockies,  that would be liveable to me.

Cara,

We store the region from the path cuts in the database as a single EnPower Region.  That means that we can only map California to one of R10, R11, and R12.  Are you intending the regions within Path Confirmation to represent a group of EnPower Regions?  If so, we will need to make a database change to store those groupings.  I expect that the database change would take a long time because it will involve a Global database change.

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	More on the Region Choices for Path Cut

Good Afternoon,

I do want the regions to understand Enpower Regions, but at the same time not be so specific to the user.  Here is the breakdown that I would want:

California = R10, R11, and R12

Northwest = R9
	Enpower calls it MidColumbia, but many more delivery points than Just Mid Columbia are contained within it, and I don't want to list them all in the region choice or 	confuse the useres further by them looking for something in the northwest that is not MidColumbia.

WSCC-S=R7

Rockies = R7A

WSCC-N=R8

Please also see my notes below on the existing system. I am happy to provide any further explanation you would like.

Subject:	RE: Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Cara,

It appears that some clarification on the Regions is necessary.  Vish has implemented the cuts to show regions as defined by the Regions table in EnPower.  This is the same table that is used in many of our reports.  Should the regions that you are speaking of be separate from EnPower's list of regions?  

Vish tells me that ""California"" equates to all of NP-15, SP-15, ZP-26.  Also he is unable to resolve ""Northwest"".    Should we not resolve your list of regions to the EnPower list?


Also, as an aside, I took a look at the West Discussion - Schedule Information in Notes and noticed that when looking at cuts the tree hierarchy was as follows

Hour Ahead / Real-Time
Region?  (e.g.  Montana, MARKETER, WSCC, NW, SW, FED Utility) This is why I want preset regions, right now they are user defined and a mess
Date
Path
Cuts

I think the best way is to have the sort selection as it is in the new system, by date primarily, and then the nifty sort tool you all have written

Is the second item in the tree related to the region selection for path cuts?  Yes

Thanks,
Will

Subject:	Testing PSW and Path confirmation

Good Afternoon,

Here are my findings for the latest Release of the PSW and Path Conf. I am re-running the date of June 22, as I see no data in the path confirmation for that date.

PreSchedule Workspace:

I tried to open the sheet ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  and got this error ""Access violation at address 00000016. Read of address 00000016.  I could not save, close or do anything, I had to end task to get out of the sheet and the PSW.  I had run the COB sheet prior to opening the PV sheet, and had closed the COB sheet. When I re-opened the ""PV_JUNE22_LIMITED""  sheet, it was completely blank.  This kind of data loss would be catastrophic in production if we were not using an outside Excel spreadsheet. 

Error checking
The workspace seemed to get stuck on one deal not being a market deal (#657854.1) that was put in the market deal number area. It is an EPMICALPOOL deal that is a buy/resale.  This error is understandable in the rows where the deal is present, but the routing error check mentioned it in rows 69-192, where the deal number was not present. Can the sheet be made to understand that a buy/resale should be tolerated in either the Supply or Market deal number cell?

I also got just ""Error:"" with no explanation of what the error was for rows 3-6, 9-11 and 21-28.  Rows 3-6  and 9-11, has a NW delivered upstream and Portland General System Downstream, both identified as Portland General System on the sheet. Rows 21-28 I see no errors apparent. 

My second PV sheet gave me  routing error  ""Error:""  with no explanation on rows 2-45.  The only thing I see is that I have chosen R instead of X for the export.  I changed all rows to X, and still got the routing error with no explanation.  I have enclosed that sheet for your inspection. Could it be that the system already detects routes?

 << File: PV_JUNE22_LIMITED.psc >> 



Path Confirmation:

The Transmission information seems to be populating correctly, all trans looks good and has the -E- on each side. I can put my POR/POD info in the Oasis cell, and all the info looks great!
The Global ID Sorting is working just right.
The Tag Sorting is also working just right.
The expanded view is showing the entire path regardless of length.
I like the POR and POD sort capability, this will be very helpful.

In the Expanded View,  even though I know the counterparty, this view sometimes shows me a blank drop down box where the counterparty should be. Allegheney did not show a counterparty name here. This actually looks like it might be specific to Allegheney.

In the line view My counterparty on the sheet CPS shows Constellation Power Source, Inc.  but in the expanded view I see City Public Service of San Antonio. They both have CPS as their short name, but the second counterparty is an East Desk Counterparty. Corry, Can you get their short name changed to something else you like?

Path Cut:

The regions are not what I have repeatedly asked for.  I only want to see the following:  California   Northwest   WSCC-N   WSCC-S  Rockies.  If I need to provide more explanation on this, I am happy to do so. The current breakout is too detailed as well as incomplete, and will be cumbersome for real-time and settlements to use.  These regions will correlate with the same region choices in the Discussion Dbase that I am working with Poston to get done.

Closing path cut seems to take quite a long time even when no saving is done, just over a minute. Users will percieve this as something broken.

I think that Bill Williams III and the real time group here will have more to add on path cut, I will hand this off to them very soon.  



Overall Findings:

I feel that with this release we are very close to what we need for production.  We will definately have to get a handle on the data loss issue, but the functionality looks really good.  My goal is to release this and the discussion Dbase at the same time so that we are able to tell settlements that from ""X"" date previous the records are in lotus, and from ""X"" date forward they are in the new system. Those groups will have huge confusion if we overlap days in both.

Please let me know anything else that I need to do, and when I may test again.  Thanks

"PSW/PSC 0910 Test","Will,
I found about the same issues we had already discussed while running the PSW/PSC.

I ran the sheet for 6/19 since there were no ""West"" paths in the confirmations (I still see the West paths when ""View: East Trading Desk"" is checked).

Most of the paths ""routed"" in Deal Scheduling except for a deal that contained transmission with the correct Enpower number provided (Error: Capability not supported: Cannot route transmission deals)
The ""Routing Detail"" in Deal Scheduling did not contain a check mark for ""Physical Route"" on any of the physical paths.
Also, in scheduling, the ""Edit Strip Information"" does not contain the Path or comments in the Deal Scheduling Comments section as before.

The physical path that did not route in scheduling also did not go the the Path Confirmations.


Also, I found that when I chose ""Edit"" on the Pre-Schedule Workspace, it created a New Workspace.  It also occurred twice when the mouse cursor passed by the word ""edit"" without physically clicking on it.

That's about it for today,
Corry

Until the email this morning, I had been told that we had until Thursday morning.  The contingency plan in the east is to have Corry's folks come down and help the estate staff using estate logins.

Jason,
 
Why has this now changed to Monday from Thursday morning and who made this decision?
 
Will we be able to schedule Monday without the UBS folks?

"[ NEW APPLICATIONS ] Pre-Schedule Workspace & Path Confirmation","Cara & Corry

I am happy to annouce that we have completed the two new applications which will help scheduling group
with routing and path confirmation. Currently, it is in user STAGE for you to look at ( NOT FOR TESTING ) since
there are few minor issues that need to be resolved with terminal server folks and developers.

New applications are Pre-Schedule Workspace & Path Confirmation which are available under
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Pre-Schedule Workspace
Enpower Launch Pad -> Tools -> Path Confirmation

Note that new application will not work under terminal server since it requires a special MS office file
to be installed on TS.

Thanks to all enpower developers for their continued hard work, especially Will Smith's significant contribution
to this project

I am glad to discuss with both you offline for any issues / comments / concerns

Regards,
dluu
