Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologizing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that people have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron.  

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) who do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addition to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have accepted positions with UBS Warburg:

Last Name	First Name	Last Name	First Name	
Amador	Susan	Oh	John	
Anderson	John	Platter	M	
Bulbes	Victor	Postlethwaite	John	
Chang	Fang-Tzu	Richter	Jeffrey	
Chatterton	Jill	Robinson	Donald	
Crandall	Sean	Salisbury	Holden	
Cutsforth	Diane	Scholtes	Diana

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is not entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power looks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two primary initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effort together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power commodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Richter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend talking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be located on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hope to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hurdle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enron story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are finding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the awesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remaining with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.
 
The wife looks at him and says, ""What the hell was that?""
 
And the old man replied, ""Half-time, Switch sides.""

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.
FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk.
PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.
APPLIED COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.
TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.
MEXICAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you into the army.
EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply. If there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows. They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain. They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.
CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.
ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Victims and Champions of a Darwinian Enron
By DAVID BARBOZA
OUSTON, Dec. 7 - After an accounting scandal, a bankruptcy filing and mass layoffs, Enron (news/quote) has gone from model of management vision to case study for management obfuscation. Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.

They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.

Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here?

""Innovative is a clich?, but that's what Enron was,"" Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. ""This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal.""

Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.

It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.

In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.

Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it ""didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity.""

Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August only six months after being promoted to the job.

Under Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, the company tested new strategies, like structuring its corporate culture to mimic the marketplace.

""You could come up with an idea and get people excited,"" said Janel Guerrero, 33, who worked in Enron's government affairs department, noting that a friend in the broadband unit went to top executives with an idea and Enron started moving on it quickly.

""You didn't ponder; it was about acting very quickly and it was about being a first mover,"" she added. 

Enron rapidly created ventures to trade everything from energy, paper, pulp and lumber to broadband and advertising. But quickness sometimes exacts a price. Some ventures went broke, like Azurix (news/quote), its spinoff water company. The broadband unit lost about $1 billion.

""When top management got into broadband, metal, steel, pulp, we thought it was innovative,"" Mr. Rigney said. ""When people said, `We'll trade water and waste water - that's the future,' we said, `That's cool.' I didn't hear dissent in the ranks. But I drank the Kool-Aid with everyone else, even though it made my head throb.""

Indeed, the expansion into new areas drained the profits of the successful energy trading operations, critics say. Undone by shaky accounting and too much borrowed money, the company collapsed last month. But even near the end, it was buzzing with new ventures.

""I just got here five months ago,"" said Fred Radvansky, 38, who was attending a Houston job fair. ""I was part of a group of about 70 people. We were rolling out a new Enron model. We were going to start trading freight.""

If inventiveness flourished at Enron, the freewheeling environment there also encouraged other and less agreeable impulses: cutthroat competition and management arrogance.

""It was kind of like a dot-com phenomenon,"" said Harvey J. Padewer, president of energy services at Duke Energy (news/quote), a big utility. ""They created a kill-and-eat culture.""

Mr. Rigney, the former Web site operator, remembers it well. ""People tried to take work away from you,"" he said. ""There was a Darwinism for ideas, for projects.""

That undermined the company's health, critics say. For example, it is widely believed that compensation for the people who negotiated deals with other companies was based on the size of the transactions rather than their long-term effect on the bottom line.

Annual reviews aimed at weeding out the least productive 5 to 10 percent of the work force damaged morale, and some longtime employees felt unwanted. ""There were all these M.B.A.'s coming in and they were evaluating things differently,"" said Becky Cantrell, who worked on regulatory matters. ""I was one of the oldest people at 55. When I saw someone my age it was a relief.""

For all the doubts some employees harbored, others reveled in the derring-do atmosphere even after Enron's financial fall, and cringed at the prospect of being acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote), a stodgy Houston electric utility.

""They bragged about being a meat-and-potatoes company with people who went to the University of Nebraska,"" one former Enron employee said. ""We had all these hyperactive Harvard and Stanford types. It would have never worked.""

After the merger fell apart, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2 and laid off about 4,000 employees in Houston. Over the next few days, television crews filmed weeping employees streaming out of the headquarters and carrying boxes of personal belongings, even as construction workers put finishing touches on Enron's shimmering new 40-story headquarters office tower. Some got word of their dismissal via voice mail. Others are still packing up and wondering.

""I don't think Enron will ever be recreated,"" Mr. Shankman said on Thursday, sitting on a nearly empty trading floor that was built for 500 people at Enron. ""Maybe we got into some businesses too quickly and too early.""

Enron officials and management experts insist it was not the corporate culture that brought Enron down; it was accounting mistakes or the ballooning debt of hard assets, like projects in Brazil and India.

Those facts may now be plumbed by business school case studies. In the meantime, some former employees have created Enron alumni Web sites. Others are writing letters to The Houston Chronicle about how, for a brief time, they thought they were part of something special.

""Enron was what I thought epitomized a global `American Dream' of sorts,"" wrote Kathy Walthall, a former Enron contractor. ""By far the best days of my career were as a consultant for Enron. The environment was an extreme rush. Very busy, very progressive and innovative.""

But Ms. Walthall said she was also outraged at the board for allowing the company to fall so swiftly.

""I really hope the company turns around,"" she wrote. ""But I know it will never be the same.""

	BuildRoute has been modified to allow the exclusion of DART deals.  Since they are waiting on it, it is difficult to test and Nik has done quite a bit of testing anyway, we promoted it to Stage.  Please contact Fran Chang about testing.  If it goes OK and she wants to, we can put it in as a production break fix.

I wanted to let you know you have read-only access to the CWI for viewing
your lossess, ancillary services and transmission information.  However,
when you log in now, you will need to use your current user id but your
password has been reset to default.  Type in default as your password and
then you will be prompted to enter a new password.  After you do this, you
will then have read-only capability.  If you have any questions, please let
me know.  I'm at 360.418.2009


Les

You also will have read-only access now but you will not be prompted to
change your password.  We did the change under a blanket authority so it
only requires Cara to change hers.  You should be able to continue to use
your current user id and password and be fine.  If you have any questions,
please let me know.  

Thank you,

I am still here, there is so little work that pretty much all I do is talk to people, play computer games and read e-mail.  I still can't believe that this has all happened.  

Dave is doing better, he is calmer now and less upset. I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was.
He is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance. They had a gardener come out, but Dave is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house. I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance. They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.

Work is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.

Noted about the changes need to go thru you.  For now I only forwarded the request for adding a check box for option to exclude DART products.  From what you wrote, seems like we need the report to be able to show DART deals only, so real time can see it.  So basically we have two requests:  one to enable us to exclude/include DART deals and one to enable us to run DART deals only (while excluding all other deals that are going to be scheduled day ahead?)

* when IT gets back to me on the addition of the check box I will let you know so you can play around to see if that's how you want it to work.

Build route is a very vital part of what we use every day. Any change to it must go thru me.

The change in the Build Route for DART deals is a minor one, a check box on the user interface. Real time can run the report to show only DART deals, and they would be captured that way.

Please see me before any changes to the build route are discussed.

Just so you know I have submitted a request to Bill Crook's group (Bill Crook took over Will Smith's old responsibilities).  I will keep you and Sean posted when IT made progress on this.  I am curious what this Build Route report is and how schedulers use it, generally speaking.  Also, I understand that you would like to see the DART products excluded (by a check box) in this report.  While they won't show up in this report in the future, where should the deal info show up in stead in order for Real Time scheduling to pick it up?  Do we need real time position manager modified accordingly as well?

Maybe next time when you run the Build Route report I can go over and watch a bit, if you don't mind.  Let me know.

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, ""Seven Points.""
 
His wife rolls over and says, ""What in the world was that?""
 
The old man replied, ""It's fart football.""
 
A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, ""Touchdown, tie score.""
 
After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, ""Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7.""
 
Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, ""Touchdown, tie
score.""
 
Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, ""Field goal, I lead
17 to 14.""
 
Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he

The change in the Build Route for DART deals is a minor one, a check box on the user interface. Real time can run the report to show only DART deals, and they would be captured that way.

Just so you know I have submitted a request to Bill Crook's group (Bill Crook took over Will Smith's old responsibilities).  I will keep you and Sean posted when IT made progress on this.  I am curious what this Build Route report is and how schedulers use it, generally speaking.  Also, I understand that you would like to see the DART products excluded (by a check box) in this report.  While they won't show up in this report in the future, where should the deal info show up in stead in order for Real Time scheduling to pick it up?  Do we need real time position manager modified accordingly as well?

Maybe next time when you run the Build Route report I can go over and watch a bit, if you don't mind.  Let me know.

Thanks,

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

 (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.

Dave is staying at Bob and Sandi's for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS
The Enron Corporation (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE>) told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question.
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan. 
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further.
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon.
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night.
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=DYN>), its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through

would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September.
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year.
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year - meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities.
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced.
""Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,"" Ms. Coale said. ""But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.""
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms.
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced.
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger - currently $11.71 an Enron share.
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9.
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million.
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet.
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
""It is not possible to predict,"" Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ""An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.""

"Hi Mom, I love you","Dear Mom,

I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.  You still mean as much to me now as ever. I am your family whether I am married to Dave or not.  You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.

I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much Dave needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything. 

Dave has decided to stay with Bob and Sandi, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  I am glad, things are very tense and weird.  I just want to get everything settled. He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.  He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. I got him this truck to help him with his business. Wanna buy a brand new truck?

Anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.

503/810-1105


Love,

Cara,

The Deals 576490.1 & 737863.1 are booked in strange way, we segregate these deals depend on the Day week Mask, 

If DOW is  -MTWTFS- (Monday thru Saturday, excluding Sunday & Holidays), for WEST desks we segregate them into  1-24 Hours category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400) 
If DOW is S------H (Sunday and Holiday, except Monday thru Saturday), for WEST desk we segregate them into Off Peak Deals
If DOW is -MTWTFS--(Monday thru Friday, excluding Saturday, Sunday & Holidays), for EAST desks we are secreting them into  1-24 Hours Category, if power flows Round The Clock (Hours 0000-2400)  
If DOW is S------SH--(Saturday, Sunday & Holidays excluding Monday thru Friday), for EAST desks we are secreting them into Off Peak Deals

Where as 
Deal # 576490 DOW is -MTWTFSH,  that is  the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section
Deal # 737863 DOW is SM--TFSH, that is the reason Pre Schedule Work space is segregating this deal into Off-Peak Section

If you want to segregate the deal into OnPeak/24 Hours/Off-Peak  depending on the number of hours it is flowing, not depend on the Day Week mask, let me know I will make the changes required in Pre - Schedule Work Space an release it in the next version.

Good Evening

I ran a master download for December 1 so that over the next few days I can test the overwriting fix, and found two deals that are 24 hour deals, show scheduled hours of 1-24, but are segregated with the ""OFF PEAK"" deals. 

The deal numbers are:

576490.1	 
737863.1	 


Can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category?


Here is my PSW sheet:

I believe this is Developmentor's 12/3 one-week course (see  <http://www.develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=10>)  It ordinarily goes for $1800 per person.
 
Mike N, can you give me some guidance regarding how much cost per person or how much cost total you would be prepared to pay.  Again, he is trying to fill up a class that is about to be cancelled, and I think he would be willing to negotiate.
 
Tim, would you or anyone on your floor have any interest in this?

Hi,

We are categorizing the deals in Build Route depending on type of the deal:

If the deal strip is during Peak hours, Build route includes theses deals in On Peak deals section
If the deal strip is during Off-Peak hours, Build route includes these deals in Off-Peak deals section
If the deal strip is for 24 hours, Build route includes these deals in 24Hour Section deals

 We are observing few deals strips only for few hours and not follows any of the above mentioned sections, they are not part of any Peak/OffPeak/24Hour section, and Build route is not selecting these deals.
I am proposing to add one more section called ""Other Deals"" and to include all these deals in this section. 

Please let me know, if you have any questions/suggestions/comments in this regard.

I just heard from Chris Lue, UBS HR, regarding the UBS New Hire paperwork.  All New Hire paperwork must be completed before 3:00 PM TODAY, Friday, 1/25/02 or UBS will be unable to process your payroll.  

These forms were distributed during the HR Benefit meetings held yesterday.  If you were unable to attend these meetings and are unsure about what forms need to be completed, please see either Grace or I ASAP.

"RE:","Dear Little Sister,

Thank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the Rich/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with Dave and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.

I am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.

I have the house to myself this weekend, Dave is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.

I love you,

Cara

Hi Baby,

The movie sounds good, nice and creepy! I am going to leave here around noon again ( such a slave ) and go home and work on packing. I can meet you at work or we can leave from the house when you get there.

I love you, I can't tell you how my heart leapt for joy when I saw your face again. I just wanted to hold on to you forever. Those 2 romps were not bad either! ;)

See you tonight, hope you get it all built today.

To:	All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON
Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Hi","Hi Mom,

Things are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.  Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   The weekend was strange, Dave came back from Eugene un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.

I am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Just pray for him and for me.

School sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. How fun!  

I love you!

Here's the deal:

A call swaption was sold to me by pollard for the intrinsic and extrinsic value of the desks on the floor times 3.50 per month.  I sold this put to myself and pocketed a next fixed premium of one million dollars. I took that six million dollars and used it to finance the new snickers plant that is going to be built in 10 years.  I divided the reesee's plant and the snickers plant, sold put-call parodies on the reesee's and put the snickers plant up for collateral on a 20 million dollar loan to finance potato chip options.

My net was 3.5 billion dollars, so I am the one buying Enron.

Hello all!

First, thank you for your generosity this holiday season, especially during this difficult time. Your gifts and donations will help bring holiday cheer into the lives of our three adopted families.

If you have chosen a gift tag from the tree: 
Please make sure your gift is clearly labeled with the recipient's name and a description of the gift. (We want to insure that all of the children have received gifts.) 
We ask that all gifts be wrapped and under the tree by Tuesday, December 18th. 
Also, if you have not already dropped the half of the gift tag into the red/gold box by the tree, please do so. This will not only allow us to keep track of who is purchasing what and for whom, but it will also enter your name into the drawing for Blazer tickets.

Once again, we appreciate your participation in our Enron Elves Event. If you have any questions or suggestions about ways we can help make our adopted families' holiday even more jolly, please let us know.

Bill and I are considering having Real time do the EPE preschedules since they are the ones that live and die by them anyway.  That way you would be released from that burden and any errors would be all on the ownership of RT.

I will see what I can do about the cut-over.  Until the email this morning, I had been told that we had until Thursday morning.  The contingency plan in the east is to have Corry's folks come down and help the estate staff using estate logins.  Is this possible for you folks as well.

I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see who does it first!).

Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will give you a call to fax.

Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?

1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!

2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.

Have a great day!

Good Morning Darling,

Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.

Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland! ;)

I hope things are going well for you today and that you had an enjoyable
Thanksgiving.

I just wanted to follow up with you regarding your order.  I know you wanted
the basket with the lightbulb, but I wanted to know if there was anything in
particular that you wanted added or deleted from the basket.

Also, I am needing to know when you would like me to deliver these.  You can

Thank you for your order.
I hope you have wonderful Holidays.

"I am wearing you to work today","Good Morning..........sir,

I am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and I feel like I have you wrapped around me. My roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.

I had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.  Good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.  One guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, I fell on my right hip, but not before I nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall. I ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.  I told him no more of that stuff. On the way home from the party I almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.  

You have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.

:)

I am doing fine, things are still wierd, but Dave has gone to stay with his parents and only comes to town to deal with his vending machines.  I went to the law store and got all the documents, but I find them very intimidating. I think I would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that I know it is all done right. I would like your advice on this matter.
 
I have been going to parties and movies and such,  having fun.  I have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named Craig. He is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked.

I didn't really sleep well last night, so I am tired and cranky today. However, the feeling of RFP is something to grin about. Today I am tying out our February positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling Feb 1.  Just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.  

You are so important to me, I can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me. I love you and am so proud and happy to be yours. I can't wait till we share a home and I am 'out' to my family.  I want to tell them, ""this is done"" not ""this is what I am going to do"".  I love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning. The sleep thing will work itself out, I am not worried about it.

I am looking forward to forever with you.

Hello all!

First, thank you for your generosity this holiday season, especially during this difficult time. Your gifts and donations will help bring holiday cheer into the lives of our three adopted families.

If you have chosen a gift tag from the tree: 
Please make sure your gift is clearly labeled with the recipient's name and a description of the gift. (We want to insure that all of the children have received gifts.) 
We ask that all gifts be wrapped and under the tree by Tuesday, December 18th. 
Also, if you have not already dropped the half of the gift tag into the red/gold box by the tree, please do so. This will not only allow us to keep track of who is purchasing what and for whom, but it will also enter your name into the drawing for Blazer tickets.

Once again, we appreciate your participation in our Enron Elves Event. If you have any questions or suggestions about ways we can help make our adopted families' holiday even more jolly, please let us know.

Happy Holidays!


----The Enron Elves Team----

Please see the attached email below for what IT is planning to modify Build Routing report to accomodate and differentiate DART products.  From what we've discussed, you would like to have the default as with the ""exclude DART deals"" checked, right?  Also, did you also say you want IT to create another function for this report to run DART deals only (so the report will only show DART products) so real time schedulers can run it to see what he/she needs to pick up?

Fran,

We worked on excluding the DART deals from the BuildRoute report.
The report will look like that:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 
If you have the ""Exclude DART deals"" box unchecked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP1_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 
Deal 500056.1 is a DART deal.

If you have ""Exclude DART deals"" box checked then you will get a file like this:
 << File: BRtestP2_3Deals_Nov26.xls >> 

Please let me know if that's what you need to see.
I can send you similar files that show more then 3 deals.

Thanks!

I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.

That should take care of it.

Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the ""DART flag"" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.  

Thanks,

Subject:	New West Power Deal Info

Confidential:  For Internal Distribution Only

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

I wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.

Today there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything.

On the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.

Hopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?

I am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.

Last night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.

ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

"HI Sweetie","I am so glad you got internet service at home!  Earthlink is good.

Have a wonderful time in Florida, I liked it bunches when I went.  Things are strange here, Dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now. He wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that I got it for him a couple of months ago.  OK. I have a truck now and he has the car.  Wanna buy a truck?  He is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me. It is so tense and weird right now that I am glad to have the house to myself.  I don't really want to be there either.

I have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this. I went to a Seattle Seahawks game yesterday at the University Stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during Scotty's surgeries. Seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain. Our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry. I have a movie Tomorrow and a party Wednesday. Tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.

I love you very much! Thanks for keeping me in your heart.

Would it help if I faxed you the 'you will have your card in 2 weeks' note they just gave me?

You are in my heart today, how goes the fight?

Dave has gone to his parents for the weekend to give me some space, and I am really liking being alone.

I love you and hope you all are well.

"Build Route Difficulties","I have re-started Enpower since the e-mail came out saying that the new version has been put into production.

I ran the attatched sheet, and the last group of deals that I was given had old deals blended with new deals.

"Black Hawk Down","Hi Sweetie,

Hopefully the visit to the Dr won't be that bad, do you want me to come hold your hand? (That would be pushing the envelope on intimacy, eh?) I saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there. You need to fix that ( or those as it were). Please let me know what the dr. says.

The movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.  I wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either. I need to vacuum but that is all.

I love you, and am so glad that I make you happy. I want us to be happy together for many years to come. I still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.

See you tonight,

C

The trip and all really took it out of me, I am taking off for home now, looking at a little nap action and then if I feel good start packing.  I love you and will see you this after noon.

Don't work my man too hard, but I will rub your feet when you get home if you do!

Love,
