Attached are the revised agreements based on our discussion prior.  Please review and if everything  looks good, I will prepare executables for MidCon.
Please note the following revisions:

	1.  Midcon installs, owns, and operates the Deer Park Interconnect.	
	2.  HPL installs, owns, and operates the Flagstaff Interconnect.
	3.  If the pressures committments are violated in accordance with the terms, the violating party pays the others cost incurred at that interconnect.
	4.  Each Party still entitled to 1/2 capacity at each interconnect.

  

Please call if you have any questions.  x-33512.

Can I add two more vaction days?  Since I am driving to Penscola, I would like visit a very sick friend in New Orleans.  If I can, I would like to take May24th & May 30th also.  I will make sure the bammel positon report and the AGA activities are covered.  May close should not be a problem since we are adding since we are updating assumptions as we inject.  I can make the final true-ups for May on the 31st.  Let me know if these extra vacation days will cause a problem for you.

Jim, I know I asked you a similar or maybe even the samequestion a few weeks ago but I really believe that the question was limited to ERCOT and we therefore determined that other than Bammel , Enron had no storage in ERCOT......I do recall that you mentioned 2 places where we had capacity...but that were not in ERCOT...I do believe they are in TEXAS and the question now is Enron's storage capacity in all of TEXAS.  

I need this information Urgently.................PLEASE HELP!!!!!!

As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September
I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, ""We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?""  
""Sure,"" said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, ""Now go out and play.""  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, ""What religion do you think we are?""  
The oldest one said, ""We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you.""

"RE: MMBtu Enhancement","Chris:

Assuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from someone like Garry Wilson (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a method that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percentage was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I would appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is used and how it is put in the model.

Subject:	MMBtu Enhancement

Hi Jim, 

I'm still working on the modelling of the Kathleen Ann storage and one of the issues I need to account for is mmbtu enhancement. How would you suggest I account for this? Currently, to get the the intrinsic storage value, I take the max working gas capacity times the may/jun - dec spread over the curve. One idea is to just take the incremental mmbtus times the spread as well -- although this wouldn't account for the physical capacity contraints, it would put a value on the enhancement.

Thanks,

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the ""e mail"" I received in case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

The balance in my 401K plan is $547,038 in the Stable Asset Acct.  There is around $200 in ENE and $200 in one of the other funds.  How I got that who know!
Esop is around $105.  The majority has been transferred to my IRA's over the years.

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what's in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don't get my way.  Ha, Ha

I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of ""If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control"" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess
parachute payment,"" according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

Dear Monique,

The gas processing plant has been shut down for many years and is in fact dismantled.  I would leave off any mention.
There is an active compressor station in fact it was converted to electric from gas in 1999.
There is still an active underground storage facility.  Capabilities have improved from what you have to the following:
	Storage Capacity: 70 BCF to 115 BCF
	Maximum Injection Capacity: 510,000 Mcf/d
	Maximum Withdrawal Capacity:  1,400,000 Mcf/d

Things are OK down here!
Nothing really new since last night!

NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat.
That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month!
Its the little things that count, right!

They continue to hate ENE!
It really makes me wonder?

Thanks Jim S.

I suggest that we notify AEP of this amount during our meeting with them this week.  We also need to develop a process of how we are going to update them of the impending volumes at the end of May without compromising our trading position.

Tom M. please discuss with Jim and we can cover at the meeting on the June bid week deal approval process that Lillian is arranging.

Subject:	Bammel Working Gas Sale To AEP

As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.

"Cannon Interest Houston Contract Extension","Jason:
As we talked last week Cannon Interest Houston has called and indicated that they would like to extend the current Base Load Buy / Sell Contract and also their Bammel Storage Contract.  I will be faxing to you this afternoon the existing Contract's that I have marked through with the changes.  A brief summary is as follows:
	The Buy / Sell Contract is where Cannon Interest Houston delivers gas to HPL June - October and receives gas from HPL November - February.
	The purchase price June - October is Houston Ship Channel Index.  The sales price November - February is the June - October Houston Ship Channel 	WACOG plus $.21.  The Term currently goes through February, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston has proposed that the term be extended through 		February, 2011 and that the sales price November - February of each year be the June - October Houston Ship Channel Index plus $.17.

	The Bammel Storage Contract currently has a term through February 28, 2005.  Cannon Interest Houston would like to extend the term through February 	28, 2011 at a Storage fee of $400,000 per year.  

The individual at Cannon Interest Houston that you need to call if you have any questions is Patrick Locke.  His telephone number is 713-706-4318.  If you have trouble reaching him it may be easier to call his cell phone which is 713-817-5388.  

I would appreciate it if you would call so we can discuss once you have had time to review.  713-853-7705

Jean, 

Thought you'd find this interesting.  It's an excerpt from an analyst's note
out this AM.

A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:
It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,
but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.

The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in various
off balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparently
became too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,
their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated into
something beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began
30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)
sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. They
involved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value
(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. This
allowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.

If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: very
New Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,
to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as the
latest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of the
table in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJM
partnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.
Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passed
muster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporized
in the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It had
used up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If these
were fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.

Hi Jim,

The shipping quote to your door is 269.00/game. There was know price break
on two or more because they had to be but on individual pallets.  Here are
some pictures of what I have available in the classic games. I almost forgot
to tell you.  We have a brand new gauntlet Legends 4 player in a dedicated
Cabinet available for only 2,195.00 this game was 3995 new a year ago.  It
is brand new and never been used.  It's a great buy if you like action
adventures games.  I think your kids will like it.  Also 4 players can play
at the same time.  It a great game with lots of hidden treasures and secret
doors.  We only have two units left and I think the skating rink in League
City, TX is going to get one.  Also would you want us to set them on free
play for you or do you want to use quarters to make them work.  It's your
choice.  It's the last picture title Gauntletebay.jpg

Let me know if you have made any decisions

Thanks,

Lutz

"BAMMEL AD VALORUM TAX","As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September
I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.

It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

Anne

I left the following in your office this morning:

1) Correspondence and Gregg Modeling inovice totalling $107,635.  We feel that this is an issue that AEP needs to settle directly with Gregg Engineering.

2) D.L. Peterson Trust invoice totalling $22,152 for a truck.   AEP has paid the invoice dated 5/24/01 and asked us for reimbursement.  However we see this as a non-emergency purchase right before close that was not properly authorized by Brian.  

Also attached is an updated Inventory and Working Capital Calculation Statement.  I have updated based on the change in the prime rate yesterday.

"Financial Disclosure of $1.2 Billion Equity Adjustment","For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I'm ashamed to admit that I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management and agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Management can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone else needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communication the Employee's have received over the last few years about values such as Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda intended to get Employee's to believe Senior Management really supported these values so that no one would really notice that their actions represented something just the opposite.

I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human nature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you have said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with the statement ""It's just a balance-sheet issue""  implies to me that this individual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certainly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the game of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to present a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the definition of the word ""HEDGE"".  A hedge by definition implies that the upside and downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out asking customers to let Enron help them ""HEDGE"" their risk when I'm not sure Enron's Senior Management understands what a hedge means?

I'm also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow in the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confused in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say "" do as I say not as I do""? I guess we need to have audits performed of Senior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as their word?

The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these transactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opinion is ""CRIMINAL"".  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perpetrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and need to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, having all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you were hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involved and to institute criminal charges.   

I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee's a thorough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job performance to date.

Brad:
Right now we have to assume that we will be withdrawing Nov. 2000 through March, 2001 with a goal of emptying the facility down to 60 BCF.  This will require the injection of approximately 55 BCF of gas from April 1, 2001 through October 31, 2001.  Available run time should be no lower than 98%.  Why would it be greater?
The rest will have to be answered by someone else.

Subject:	Estimation of Potential KVSR fuel expense

Hanover Compression has given me a revised fuel consumption number of 7150 BTU/horsepower-hr for the KVSRs once they have been converted to Clean Burn technology.  This compares to the present 7500 BTU/horsepower-hr.  We need to come to a consensus on the assumptions that will be used with this figure.  These assumptions will need to be as follows:

How many hours a year do we really think that these units will run?  I am assuming that they will not be running if Bammel is on withdrawal.  Correct or not?
How much horsepower will really run?  This will be determined by how much market HPL will hope to capture from ANP and possibly Equistar.  It will also be affected by the suction pressure of the gas, which is, in turn, determined by how much HPL is injecting and pressures at Katy.
Finally, what available run time do we want to assume here?  90%?

I have no preconceived notions of what these assumptions should be; therefore, I am soliciting input from each of you.  We need to be in agreement before Emma starts her work.  Thank you.

Nick & Brad:

What is the status of the MidCon Flagstaff Meter Station?  As contemplated HPL is having a difficult time delivering Entex volumes into MidCon during the cold weather Houston has been experiencing.  Given changes in MidCon's system this situation will probably continue to be a challenge throughout the winter.  This problem is compounded by the start up of the Nov. - Feb. deliveries to MidCon of 83,334 MMBtu/d.  All of our eggs seem to be collecting in the Flagstaff Meter Station so its imperative that this station be operational ASAP.  Please provide me with an update!

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

Hi Jim
 
Hope work is going ok with all the changes taking place there.
 
Just wanted to let you know we have been looking at cars.  
 
We asked the kids what they thought.  They really like the SUV's. 
 
I think another mini-van would be great as far as room to move around as well as having 7 places to sit, but the kids are a little more interested in what looks ""cool"".         : )
 
There are a couple midsize suv's that now have a third seat (although the seat it is closer to the ground).  That might be a good compromise.(?)
 
Anyway, it sure is FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to look.  
 
Thanks for being there for us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
Let me know if you have any thoughts on the process.

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 


'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

""In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,"" Lay said. ""The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence."" 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

""These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully,"" he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

""Everything we know, you now know,"" Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Jim,
I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion Gas.

According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually withdrawn what we have booked.

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess
parachute payment,"" according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days.

Remember the Centanna Storage Contract you reviewed a couple of weeks back.  It has never been signed I'm waiting on a few replacement pages from Duke.  Given the Bankruptcy filling is there anything special I need to do?  Do I need special approval?  Duke is being very cooperative and is trying to work with Enron to meet our needs.  If the term needs to be reduced they are willing to do whatever it takes.  I would appreciate your input as to what to do or whom I should talk.

Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
next to ours.  
Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?

Subject:	BAMMEL AD VALORUM TAX

As we draw near to the HPL transfer to AEP on June 1, I wanted to remind everyone about the Bammel Ad Valorum Tax.  As we discussed earlier this year the Tax needs to be split between Enron and AEP based on the number of months ownership during the year.  Since the actual liability is not likely to be known until August or September
I assume both parties will have to reach agreement as to how to handle this matter.

Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!

Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.

Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend.
Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.

Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!

Subject:	Bammel Gas Compressor Cost Projection

The attached schedule is my projection of Bammel Injection activity through the remainder of 2000.  This is an estimate as of today March 5, and will change as the futures curve changes.  The schedule also includes a Fuel Percentage Table that I would recommend using in the future to determine the fuel percentage to be utilized at different Gas In Place levels.  

It is my understanding that all Electric Compressor Cost will be charged to a separate location each month and the Storage Book will credit that location with the calculated gas compressor costs on a monthly basis.   Please let me know if this is your understanding and if the Fuel Percentage Table recommended above is OK with you!

Irene / Tom:

All of the contracts below can be terminated except for:
	Texas General Land Office
	Cannon Interest - Houston
	Enron North America  (I assume this will terminate with the sale.
There has not been any activity on the rest for a couple of years.
Kenny would you please check to see if any of the contracts to be terminated have any residual balances and get with the appropriate individuals to clear up ASAP.

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn't get anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they had not been baptized and didn't go to Sunday school. So they went to the nearest church, but only the janitor was there.  
One said, ""We need to be baptized because no one will come out and play with us. Will you baptize us?""  
""Sure,"" said the janitor.  
He took them into the bathroom and dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then he said, ""Now go out and play.""  
When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, ""What religion do you think we are?""  
The oldest one said, ""We're not Katlick, because they pour the water. We're not Bablist because they dunk all of you. We're not Methdiss because they just sprinkle you.""  
The littlest one said, ""Didn't you smell that water?""  
""Yes. What do you think that means?""  
""That means we're Pisscopalians""

I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed at the meeting previously.  

Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party, if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations. 

Does this need to stay or be removed?  If this needs to stay, should someone tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?

MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the facilities.

"VAR LIMITS","I know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.
	1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. 
	2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.
			VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L
	   EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION
	   CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION
	   TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION
	3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as Tom & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit.
			The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.
			(For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.)
		This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  

Please give me your thoughts when you have a chance.

	Thanks,  Jim

MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the facilities.

Garry,

As part of the KAF modelling, I would like to account for the mmbtu enhancement. However, I would like your input as to what the most appropriate number to use. Currently--as per Brian Redmond--we have a 110% enhancement (I think this is the number that the GLO folks threw out at the meeting we attended). Is this in the ballpark? 

Thanks and best regards,

Jim,
I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion Gas.

According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually withdrawn what we have booked.

Hi Jim.  
 
We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and
a Chrysler Town & Country. 

Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration. He prefers
the smoother ride of the minivan. It will be better for taking long trips.
The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns
16. Ha! : ) 

We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has
many ""bells and whistles"" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV.

We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the
Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value. The
Toyota dealer also has ""$300 over invoice"" sale on currently. Plus they told
Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday.
Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can
choose from. 

So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday.
What do you think?
 
Love,
Linda

The ball game last night was a disaster!
We give the ""Bad News Bears"" a bad name.
Example:  Runners on 1st and 2nd. I ask the third baseman what he will do if the ball comes to him.  He replies touch third base.  So the batter hits the ball down the third base line he runs up 5-10 feet from the third base picks up the ball and throws it to the pitcher.  I give up!  We lost 20 to 3

On a worse note.  Please don't say anything to anybody but Pat just called and said Shannon has filled for divorce.
I hate to say this but he has created his own worse nightmare.  She has never earned a penny of the money she has become accustomed too, yet feels it should belong to her.  He has done nothing but foster this attitude.  Too bad its not legal to spank your spouse.
I will let you know what comes of things.

Why can't everything just work out instead of all this turmoil.  I hate all of this shit!  It hurts!

Your deals are correct.  We need to write a new deal ticket for March 2001 since we injected an additonal 21,640 mmbtus.  The total was 193,050 according to scheduling.  We need to find out if Tom wants us book the withdrawal of this additional gas in May like the rest of the withdrawals.  We are still injecting in April.  We also need to find out if he wants us to write another assumption for April's injections.

These volumes equal to scheduled injections and withdrawals.  The only month that had a variance was January 2000.  We charged Texas for injections of 2,174,530 mmbtu and the actual injections were  1,242,074 mmbtu.

"Value of ENE Stock under 1994 Deferral Plan","John:

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discussions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value of the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enron employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!

"FW: Bammel Mar 01","Thanks for the way you wrote this letter!  It gets to the point, yet does not imply anything other than a search for an explanation.

Importance:	High

If measurement is correct, this will cause the texas desk to inject 235,182 mmbtu's more in March than they expected.  Is there any way we can come up with a better explanation than the field estimates were wrong?  We need to assure commercial that the cause for the discrepancy is explanable and correctable.
Let me know if the cause for the incorrect field estimates can be determined.
Thanks,
Kenny

As you know, Commercial's expectations are derived from estimates.  I have rechecked the data with Measurement and it has been determined that the EFM data is correct and no adjustments will be made.  It is believed the estimates were entered wrong from the field.

It seems the variance between commercial's expectation and measurement has not been resolved.  Please let me know what caused this variance.  The variance needs to be resolved ASAP since accounting has to close its books for March.
Thanks,
Kenny

Check it out.  This is a very high variance.  I will need an explanation before I tell commercial.
Thanks,

Earl, here is the schedule.

 

Kenny, there is a variance of 178,259 this month.  Earl will review the schedule to verify my info.  Please let me know if I need to do anything to bring this variance down.  Thanks
