"Re: Bammel Lease Question","Jim, this issue is adequately covered in the lease and related documents which were blessed by you and the storage reservoir engineers.  Why this late expressed  concern?..........if you have facts which lead you to believe that AEP/HPL is operating this facility contrary to safe/industry standards or regulatory requirements or is otherwise endangering the facility, related facilities or the integrity thereof, please call me ASAP.   Sincerely

Barbara





	Jim Schwieger/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 04:16 PM 	   To: Brian Redmond/ENRON@enronXgate, Barbara N Gray/HOU/ECT@ECT  cc: John J Lavorato/ENRON@enronXgate, Thomas A Martin/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: Bammel Lease Question	


I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself.

"Final Working Capital Schedule","Attached is a draft of the ""Final Working Capital Calculation Statement"" that would be attached to the letter that Anne is drafting that needs to be sent to AEP before Friday.  These agree to the amounts that we previously sent to AEP in a letter earlier this month except for a slight adjustment to the Centanna Ad Valorem Tax Expense number as I received an updated number from the Tax Department this week.  I have also told Jim Dedicker at AEP that I will forward him a copy of the bill from Jefferson County once we receive it.  Also keep in mind that this working capital calculation statement does not include the working gas adjustments for Bammel and Centanna which were already sent in a ""Final Working Gas Calculation Statement"" on 10/15.  Please review and verify these numbers and let me know if you think anything needs to changed, added, or omitted ASAP!

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Updated Support for Settlement Letter to AEP","Anne

I left the following in your office this morning:

1) Correspondence and Gregg Modeling inovice totalling $107,635.  We feel that this is an issue that AEP needs to settle directly with Gregg Engineering.

2) D.L. Peterson Trust invoice totalling $22,152 for a truck.   AEP has paid the invoice dated 5/24/01 and asked us for reimbursement.  However we see this as a non-emergency purchase right before close that was not properly authorized by Brian.  

Also attached is an updated Inventory and Working Capital Calculation Statement.  I have updated based on the change in the prime rate yesterday.

 

Call me at 3-5346 if you need anything else.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Dear subscriber,

If you can read this but the rest of this message looks like nonsense, it's
probably because your e-mail program cannot read messages sent in HTML
format. Unfortunately, we are no longer able to send Streetmail out in
plain-text format.

We'd love to be able to deliver our fully-functional, full-color Streetmail to you!
Would you consider upgrading your e-mail client at your ISP? Or signing up for Streetmail 
through a free web-based e-mail account (such as Hotmail or Yahoo) that is more HTML compatible?

We apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope to see you back at
Streetmail sometime soon.

Sincerely,

The Streetmail Team

Order unique, personalized gifts now-in time for 
HOLIDAY delivery!

Looking for something unusual that shows you put 
extra thought into their gift? Choose a keepsake 
that is especially for them! Here are six unique 
gifts with that personal touch. 
http://www.normthompson.com/emailcampaign/home.jsp?sourcecode=NT0130E&link=2


Monogram a robe for him or her

The luxury of a four-star hotel's thick terry robe
to wear everyday at home. Order these robes with your
gift recipient's personal monogram, instead of the
hotel's insignia. In pink or white for women, navy
or white for men.
http://www.normthompson.com/emailcampaign/home.jsp?sourcecode=NT0130E&link=3

------------------------------------------------------- 
What was happening on that very day?
------------------------------------------------------- 

What was happening on the day he graduated? On the
day she was born? Give them a real newspaper that
was published on that very day...  with a Certificate
of Authenticity.

http://www.normthompson.com/emailcampaign/home.jsp?sourcecode=NT0130E&link=4

------------------------------------------------------- 
Double-9 Dominoes in a personalized box
------------------------------------------------------- 

They will keep these dominoes on display! A more challenging
game than traditional double-6. In a handsome wooden
box with a glass top-personalized with their initials.

http://www.normthompson.com/emailcampaign/home.jsp?sourcecode=NT0130E&link=5

For the hard-working executive who could use a break!
With his own monogram so it will always return to
his desk after a playful day. Under $20!

http://www.normthompson.com/emailcampaign/home.jsp?sourcecode=NT0130E&link=6

------------------------------------------------------- 
Honor a Special Year with coins
------------------------------------------------------- 

Your father, brother, sister or friend was born in
1934? Give a 5-coin set, beautifully boxed, from
that special year or any year since (except 1975).
Under $25!

http://www.normthompson.com/emailcampaign/home.jsp?sourcecode=NT0130E&link=7

------------------------------------------------------- 
Family Crest custom-engraved
------------------------------------------------------- 

Truly a thoughtful and impressive gift! We will research
their family name; find their crest and custom-engrave
beer mugs (with 22K gold bands) or lead-crystal wine
goblets-in sets of four.

http://www.normthompson.com/emailcampaign/home.jsp?sourcecode=NT0130E&link=8

------------------------------------------------------- 
The History of a Family Name
------------------------------------------------------- 

A memorable gift for anyone! Every family name has
an interesting history and this gift honors their
heritage. We research their name, capture the details
on a certificate and frame it.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

Dear subscriber,

If you can read this but the rest of this message looks like nonsense, it's
probably because your e-mail program cannot read messages sent in HTML
format. Unfortunately, we are no longer able to send Streetmail out in
plain-text format.

We'd love to be able to deliver our fully-functional, full-color Streetmail to you!
Would you consider upgrading your e-mail client at your ISP? Or signing up for Streetmail 
through a free web-based e-mail account (such as Hotmail or Yahoo) that is more HTML compatible?

We apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope to see you back at
Streetmail sometime soon.

Sincerely,

The Streetmail Team

                              Sweco Fab, Inc., the ASME fabrication shop of PT&P specially designed and fabricated a 92-inch I.D. Toroidal bellow expansion joint for an ASME ""U"" stamp heat exchanger shell.  The toroidal shape gives the bellow the unique ability to carry high pressures; conversely, it also permits modest deflection ability.

                   How to Size a Spring Hanger
                 
                  Piping systems are used to transport gases, liquids and suspended solids between units of a plant. The temperatures of the contents and the pipe when the plant is in operation are often quite different from the ambient temperature of the surroundings. The heat transferred during changes in temperature causes metal pipe to expand and contract. Piping designers must provide for movement due to temperature changes and forces caused by pumps, gravity and other elements of the piping system. Read PT&P's ""How to Size a Spring Hanger"" Technical Bulletin for more information. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
                 
                  PT&P  Specially Designs and Fabricates Constants for a Radiant-Tube Support System  
                  These constants are an essential component of the radiant-tube support system for a reforming furnace. Piping Technology custom designed these units to fit in the limited space available inside the furnace. The bolting patterns for the constants needed to be flexible enough that they could be attached to the supporting structure with any of the support system designs being considered.  For more information about this project, please contact us at info@mail.pipingtech.com.  
                   
                 

--------------------------------------------------------------
                 
                  Slide Plates: The ""Sandwich"" Concept  
                  Piping Technology & Products, Inc. uses the ""sandwich"" concept when applying slide plates to our customers ' systems. Figure 1 shows a ""sandwich"" composed of two identical slide plates, one on top and another on the bottom. Each slide plate (which is like the bun of the ""sandwich"") and a low coefficient of friction material which is bonded to the metal backing plate.  
                       
                        Figure 1
                       
                 
                  In a typical application a slide bearing plate is welded to a structural steel member which is strong enough to provide the required support, but whose coefficient of friction is too high. Figure 2 shows an application in which a slide bearing plate is welded on top of one steel beam supporting the other beam. When the top beam moves (due to thermal expansion, for example) it slides across the surface of the bearing plate without contacting the supporting another beam. To return to our ""sandwich"" metaphor, the top half of the ""sandwich"" is bonded to the sliding beam, and to the bottom half to the supporting beam.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON 
Cc: 
Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Saturday 11/17 WX 4KZ","Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Thanks for the nice things you have said over the last week.
Your knowledge of my personality provides me with a way to see if I'm going overboard

I met with Cindy Olson this morning !
They sincerely want to know what I think needs to be done to get employee confidence back!
I was not timid in my recommendations and I really think they had already thought through a lot of them!
I came out of it optimistic.
Cindy is supposed to get back to me hopefully Friday

I would like to talk to you about some of my ideas tonight.

Thanks,
Swig

Subject:	RE: order problem

Hi Andy,

When it was decided that we would accept multi-day orders, we pointed out to Lavo and John that we do system maintenance for an hour every Friday night.  Their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason, planned or un-planned, we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unable to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill before he can get to it.

We actually have a plan in place to make this much better.  Effectively, we will have dual sites.  The second site will be used both for disaster recovery, as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage.  Unfortunately, purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given the present circumstances.

Jay,

Have received comments that when multi day limit orders are placed, they are not alive after a friday night. I think this might have to do with orders getting wiped out duirng maintenance but I wanted to alert you to this.

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001         POSTPONED
This is a notification that the Enron Corp.

Good news!  Ben passed all of his classes...by the skin of his teeth, so he

Ben and I both tried to find the web site about the wave runner license but

anxious to take the test so he can drive one of the wave runners.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

He is calling them as we speak and is going to set up the meeting for Tuesday at 10:00 and he will request that CC Pace supply us with a list of written questions.  Either way we should continue with the meeting.

"URGENT - ENA Associates & Analysts"," 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - June 20, 2001","Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do ""reality checks"", create a ""rallying point"" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the ""same page"" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

"RE: Texas General Land Office Mtg","
Jim,  I forwarded your e-mail on to Richard Bone with the Land Office.  He will be prepared to ""enlighten"" us on Thursday.

Subject:	Texas General Land Office Mtg

Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information:
	1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future?					
	2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service?
Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions.

"","Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!

"Sunday Weather Update 06/03","Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an ""official"" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the ""Sunday Update"" link (near the bottom).  Login is ""enron"", Password is ""enron"".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Milberg Weiss Announces Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp.

NEW YORK, Oct 22, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP announces that a class action lawsuit was filed on October 22, 2001, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron Corp. (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive. A copy of the complaint filed in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on Milberg Weiss' website at: http://www.milberg.com/enron/ 
The action, numbered H013630, is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, located at 515 Rusk Street, Houston TX 77002, against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge presiding over the case. 
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors. 
If you bought the common stock of Enron between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as ""lead plaintiff."" Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, or other counsel of your choice, to serve as your counsel in this action. 
Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, a 190-lawyer firm with offices in New York City, San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boca Raton, Seattle and Philadelphia, is active in major litigations pending in federal and state courts throughout the United States. Milberg Weiss has taken a leading role in many important actions on behalf of defrauded investors, consumers, and companies, as well as victims of World War II and other human rights violations, and has been responsible for more than $30 billion in aggregate recoveries. The Milberg Weiss Web site (http://www.milberg.com) has more information about the firm.

"Sunday 12/18/01 WX 4KZ","Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd 
Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

"","On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.

Nothing really new since last night!

NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat.
That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month!
Its the little things that count, right!

Subject:	Sunday Weather Update 06/03

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an ""official"" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the ""Sunday Update"" link (near the bottom).  Login is ""enron"", Password is ""enron"".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
Research Weather Team

"Adjustments for Bammel","Schedule 6 came in for April 2001.   It shows we injected 49,072 mmbtus less than we had expected.  April total ENA was 6,447,933 mmbtus.  We had tickets written for 6,497,005 mmbtus.

The last day true-up for in May 2001 shows we injected 46,246 mmbtus less than we expected.   The total scheduled volume for the month was 6,068,754 mmbtus.   We had deals totaling 6,115,000 mmbtus.

Chris Price needs an injection price to complete his cost of inventory entry.  The file I usually e-mail is storage/stcpr051 and storage/stcpr041.  I believe these files were updated except for these last two adjustments.  I can't verify this since I do not have access enron files.

Thanks,
Kenny
